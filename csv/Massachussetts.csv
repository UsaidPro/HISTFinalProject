Letter,Yes,Thomas Dwight,Nathan Dane,,,9/25/1787,"We have just received the doings of the Grand Convention, or what we suppose to be such, altho unauthenticated by any name or names, and without any prefatory address—it is in my opinion, very doubtful whether the people of this State will adopt this or any other system until it be accompanied with the ultima ratio regum2—I wish I may be erroneous in my conjectures— The insurgents of this and most of the other Counties of the State have taken the oath of allegiance—but with as ill a grace as possible—as they did it on the last day limited and allowed by Govt. for that purpose—so much milk-&-water mercy has our present administration shewn and so far have they gratified the wishes of the mobility, that many of that (now respectable) body in this part of the Commonwealth have hopes—serious hopes of some pecuniary allowances from Govt. for their severe services & sufferings during the last winter—they do not expect it at present but say they “things are coming round right very soon”—Do you not think that we poor supporters of Govt ought to refund what we have received for our services and humbly petition the legislature for an act of indemnity?"
Letter,Yes,Mercy Otis Warren,Catherine Macaulay Graham,,,9/28/1787,"I have my dear Madam postponed writing by several opportunities as I wished for the pleasure of transmiting to you the result of the Grand Convention of the united states.2 every thing has for some time hung suspended in their determinations—I now forward them to you without any comment theron. first because I do not think myself qualified to make any: and in the next place it might not be thought altogether prudent. It is now only three days since the publication of the recommendations of this respectable body has appeared in our papers, almost every one whom I have yet seen reads with attention folds the page with solemnity, & silently wraps up his opinion within his own breast, as if [23]affraid of interrupting that calm expectation that has pervaded all ranks for several months past. Our situation is truly delicate & critical, on the one hand we stand in need of a strong Federal Goverment founded on principles that will support the prosperity & union of the Colonies, on the other we have struggled for liberty & made costly sacrifices at her shrine: and there are still many among us who revere her name too much to relinquish (beyond a certain medium) the rights of man for the Dignity of Goverment. I should be happy to hear the observations of a Lady (who has made politics & Goverment so much the subject of her contemplations) on this new and complicated system: which I suppose will set in motion both the pens & the tongues of the political World. Happy indeed will this country be if a tranquil energetic Goverment can be adopted before the sword is drawn to give it a despotic master. The rumours of war assail our ears from the European shores, if the flames should really kindle there, I hope they will not spread beyond the ocean: unless internal feuds should rise to such a height as to lead the benevolent heart to wish for some foreign object to divert the General attention, & again convince this continent that we stand or fall together.…"
Letter,Yes,James Sullivan,Rufus King,,,9/28/1787,"Dear King I wrote you the last post my Sentiments in general of the report of the convention and now have yours of the 20th wherein you request my free and candid opinion upon it. I do by no means retract what you will have before this reaches in my other Letter. I consider it to be of the highest importance to have a federal Government and should this be not adopted I shall despair of having one excepting it arises from the chance of war. there are several things in the report that upon the stinted veiw I have of the subject I should wish to be altered or explained in the eighth Article Congress are impowered to “Lay and collect taxes[”] it is not ascertained what is here meant by taxes if what we Call dry taxes, a tax on polls & Estates by a census I do not see how it can be carried into Execution Congress can never appoint Collectors assessors &c besides there would be great confusion between the doings of their officers and those of particular States, had the provision been that Congress should apportion such taxes as should be necessary to the Common defence (over and above the Revenue) on the Several States and provision had been made to coerce a compliance it would have been in my opinion better.2 In the Judic[i]al power the Court is to have authority to try all causes between a State and Citizen of another State and between Citizens of different States, and one Supreme Court to be over the united States—this appears to me in the first instance to lay the particular States under very great inconveniences a debtor, defective Collector, Trespasser &c, may fly one State to another and thereby involve the State he has fled from or Trespassed against in very great cost and Trouble, Evade a trial according to the Law which governed the Contract when made, or the Lands or Chattels Trespassed upon and great delay fraud & injustice may be the consequence in the other case can it be right that every contract or note of hand between Citizens of different States in this wide commercial Country shall be tried in the Judic[i]al of the Congress?3 These objections have weight in my mind I shall not mention them to any one here because I beleive they must have been agreed to on an equivalent given which I do not see besides I am for accepting the report I hear no objection to it here yet, I came from NyPort to Day the people there are much in favour of it but what turn it may take when the objections of the gentlemen who did not Sign it are known I cannot Say— I am Dear Sir with the purest Friendship Your most Hble Sevt"
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Gazette,,10/9/1787,"The following remarks are handed to us by a correspondent as being very serious difficulties in the way of the new confederation, notwithstanding the pains which have been taken to prove, that it could not contain any thing wrong.— A confederation, for purposes merely national, would undoubtedly be exceedingly beneficial to these states. Every one should, however, be indulged in a free, but decent, examination of every proposed form. In general, publick business would go on smoothly when the mode of doing it is conformable to the habits of the people, and when employment is found for their activity. Let us upon these principles review the newly proposed federal constitution. The several states are to be represented by a small number of persons, who, during the long period for which they are to be chosen, will be invested with almost every branch of legislative authority, and will generally reside without the states represented by them. Their authority will extend not only to the foreign commerce but to the internal economy of the states. They are to keep up armies within the states at all times, and to have the sole power of calling the militia into service, excepting the case of foreign invasion. The states therefore lose the right of compelling the obedience of their own subjects. No state will be able to pay its debts otherwise than by a dry tax; imposts and excises being applied wholly to continental purposes. The several states are not allowed to certify their own debts, even without making their bills a tender. Titles of land in many cases are to be tried by a continental court. This gives the national government unequal authority in different states, and creates different interests. Some states will lose their whole jurisdiction over real estates; and the large state of Vermont will be excluded from the union. These are great difficulties and ought to be well weighed before the system is adopted, which will forever put it out of our power to remedy them, otherwise than by force of arms. Our people are every day coalescing under a wise and moderate, but firm, government. Let us not hastily divide them. Thanks are due to the gentlemen who have come so near the truth in a matter of such importance to us all. But it will probably be found necessary to have this system carefully revised and corrected, before it will be perfect, and be likely to promote the happiness of any state in the union; as it does not at present conform to their established habits."
Letter,Yes,Nathan Dane,Caleb Strong,,,10/10/1787,"You have seen, I suppose, the resolution of Congress relative to the new Constitution. It was considered as an entire new system, on its passage from the Convention to the people, and altogether extraneous to the powers of Congress. The warmest friends of it appeared to be extremely impatient to get it thro Congress, even the first day that it was taken up. They wanted Congress to approve of it, but objected to any examination of it by paragraphs in the usual mode of doing business. Very few members wanted any alterations and after two days’ debates Congress unanimously agreed the proper measure was to transmit it to the states to be laid before conventions of the people. Had Congress been of opinion that it was a subject within their cognizance, and taken time to examine it as so respectable a body ought always to do [in] such important cases, I think it is highly probable that Congress would have very fully approved of the plan proposed, and on the principles which actuated the Convention."
Letter,No,John Quincy Adams,William Cranch,,,10/14/1787,"Since politics is the word, let politics rule the roost. I have now before me the plan for the federal constitution, and will at length discuss it with you;—your objections so far as they go may be valid or not, but mine, are not to any like particulars merely but to the whole plan itself—but as the objections to the whole Can only arise, from summing those to its different parts, I will go through in order. In the § 2. of Article 1. it is said that the representatives shall be chosen every second year by the people, but why every second year? why cannot the elections be annual? why may not the people of any state at any time recall their representatives, for misbehaviour, and send others? under these restrictions we have hitherto sent delegates to congress, and we have never found any inconveniency in consequence of them. Our delegation has always been exceeding good, and the people have never abused their power in this respect by recalling a member without sufficient cause: they have indeed never used it all; because it has never been necessary to use it. and where is the necessity of making [73page icon]alterations, where no defect is proved? It may be said there is an essential difference, between a member of congress at present who is elected by the legislature, and a representative, who will be elected by the people: this may be: but the probability is that they will be the same persons. Who does our legislature appoint as members of congress? Men of reputation, & influence; known all over the Commonwealth. And who else, can the people ever elect to serve as their representatives in a future congress?— § 4. Why must congress have the power of regulating the times, places, and manner of holding elections; or in other words, of prescribing the manner of their own appointments. This power is insidious, because it appears trivial, and yet will admit of such construction, as will render it a very dangerous instrument in the hands of such a powerful body of men. § 9. How will it be possible for each particular State to pay its debts, when the power of laying imposts or duties, on imports or exports, shall be taken from them—By direct taxes, it may be said. But such taxes are always extremely unpopular, and tend to oppress the poor people. Besides which the Congress will have power to lay & collect such taxes of this kind as they shall think proper, by which means the people, will naturally complain of being doubly taxed, and their grievances will become real instead of being imaginary, as they have been hitherto. With respect to the Powers granted to the Congress in the 8th: § I cannot think with you, that they are necessary for preserving and maintaining the union.—It is yet to be proved that such powers are necessary for any body of men at the head of the union; but if this point be admitted, it is a great uncertainty, whether such a Congress as is proposed ought to have these powers.—The Senate you say, is to be the aristocratic branch of the legislature.—It ought then, not only to be a body totally distinct from the house of representatives, but they ought to be men of a different description; men of more, influence, either from their, talents, reputation or opulence; but as I have already observed, the representatives chosen by the People, will be naturally men of the same kind and description with those chosen by the legislature; and consequently the two bodies of men will be too much alike, their interests will be too much united, for them to be the checks upon one another, which they are intended to be; their interests will be alike, but will they be the interests of the people? It is easy to answer this question in the affirmative; but not so easy perhaps to prove it. And if the interests of Congress and the interests of the people should ever greatly [74page icon]militate, what would be the consequences?—Can you without shuddering, answer this question?2 It is said that after all the powers of this Congress, are not more extensive than those of our State Legislature; and therefore that they are not more dangerous. In the first place I deny the fact, and in the second place, if that were true the conclusion would be false.—The sixth article of the Confederation is full of great restraints upon our State legislature,3 from which the Congress will be wholly exempted: every one of our sister States, is a powerful check upon our own legislature: but what checks would they be to the powers of our Congress? you might as well attempt with a fisherman’s skiff to stem a torrent, but admit that the powers are the same; in whose hands are they deposited? In this state 400,000 men are represented by near 300. at Congress 3000,000 will be represented by 65. here there are 31 senators & 9 counsellors; there, there would be only 26 Senators.—will any one pretend to say that the same powers, would not be more dangerous in this Congress? But to crown the whole the 7th: article, is an open and bare-faced violation of the most sacred engagements which can be formed by human beings. It violates the Confederation, the 13th: article of which I wish you would turn to, for a complete demonstration of what I affirm; and it violates the Constitution of this State,4 which was the only crime of our Berkshire & Hampshire insurgents.5 As a justification for this, it is said, that in times of great distress and imminent danger, the Constitution of any country whatever must give way; and that no agreements can be put in competition, with the existence, of a nation: but here, in order to apply this proposition, which is undoubtedly true, two points are to be established: the first, that we are now in this tremendous situation, where our very national existence, is at a stake; the second that no better remedy can be found than that of a revolution.—The first it appears to me, no man in his Senses, can pretend to assert: our situation it is true is disagreeable; but it is confessedly growing better every day, and might very probably be prosperous in a few years without any alteration at all. but even if some alteration be necessary, where is the necessity of introducing a despotism, yes, a despotism: for if there shall be any limits to the power of the federal Congress, they will only be such as they themselves shall be pleased to establish. These are my general objections to the scheme: they may be erroneous; or they may be not the most important: but I confess they are such as make me anxious for the fate of my country.—If you think me too presuming for mistrusting a plan proposed by men of so much [75page icon]experience and abilities, as are the members of the late convention, I can only say that my opinion depends not upon my will.—I will moreover confess to you that the defence of the Constitutions,6 is an authority in my mind, and has had considerable influence upon my opinions.—Many passages of that book, will, if true, make very much against the proposed constitution; and I fear the author will be not a little chagrined, when he finds what a revolution has taken place in the sentiments of his countrymen, within these seven years. However, if the federal Congress is to be established in the manner proposed, I can only say that my earnest wish is, that all my fears may be disappointed."
Newspaper,No,Another,,Essex Journal,A Correspondant,10/17/1787,"A CARD, to ‘a Correspondent.’ “WHETHER WE SHALL BE A UNITED NATION OF IMPORTANCE, OR BECOME PETTY ANARCHIES—THAT’S THE QUESTION:” This, Sir, is a great assertion. Are you sure you could throw the Commonwealth into a state of anarchy, if the proposed fœderal Constitution is not adopted? Remember Daniel Shays, about a year ago, expected the seat of government. Let the unprosperous issue of his Adventure be an admonition to all malecontents:—Or dare you predict that anarchy would be the necessary consequence of preserving the present constitution? The extinction of the late Rebellion, and the present tranquility in this state are confounding evidences of your irreverence for the truth.—It is much beyond your fallible penetration to determine what will be the opinion of ‘unbiassed posterity,’ they may think as you do, or very different, if they do not feel as you do. The wisdom of the Convention is not doubted—but they may have erred. It is to be wished their report may have a wise and temperate discussion, and if it will not bear a severe trial, that it may not be adopted. A revolution every seven years must be very expensive and dangerous, and deprive us of the benefits we might derive from even an imperfect Constitution.—It is to be feared you are one of those sanguine gentlemen who think it as easy to form a Constitution & change a government, as it is for you and me to scribble paragraphs for a News-Paper."
Newspaper,No,,,Connecticut Journal,,10/17/1787,"Dear Sir, I received your favor of the 24th ultimo enclosing the doings of the Convention at Philadelphia, directed to His Excellency the President of Congress [in?] three days after the date, which favor I should have highly prized had you not, at the same time, enjoined it upon me to make my objections to them (if any I had), and likewise that I would point out any alterations that may be made in our present Articles of Confederation which will better secure the natural rights, privileges, and liberties of human nature, and at the same time effectually support the authority and dignity of the states, and public faith. I now sit down to perform the first part you have enjoined upon me, but with great reluctance, for reasons I shall assign in my next, which I esteem the most arduous task you have assigned me, which you claim [as?] a debt due both to the public and yourself. My objections to the doings of our Honorable Convention are many. You must excuse me if I do not mention one-half of them. I must be concise—shall mention only those which I conceive are CAPITAL, and would first observe generally: The form of government prescribed is too COMPLEX, couched in terms of many instances doubtful as though there was some art used to cover the full extent of the powers delegated, to be easily understood by all who ought to accept or reject the same; and that the form of government recommended most probably will be attended with greater expense than can be supported by an infant country exhausted of her wealth by the late war and impoverished by our own follies and luxuries since the peace, and the loss of our trade, the recovery of which there is not the least prospect, as restraints are laid upon it by all the powers in Europe, which however I took upon [as] a circumstance much in our favor, as it will gradually serve to disconnect us from the nations of Europe, for I have no desire we should import either foreign LUXURIES or foreign VICES. A gradual decay of our trade must gradually increase our own manufacturers—which must increase industry, which will have a powerful influence to reform our morals. Nothing will promote industry so powerfully as necessity, unless it is cramped by an arbitrary sovereign and despotic government. No man will work with that cheerfulness for his lord, as he will when he knows his earnings are his own, nor do I think this three-branched government will sit easily [on?] the minds of the people, whose peace and quiet must be consulted, or we shall have trouble. The populace or multitude (as they are now called in contempt), when we first opposed British tyranny were complimented by the patriots of that day in halls and under liberty poles as being the fountain and origin from whence all power was derived, will not [sit?] easy under any government where they are deprived of all power, or so fettered in the exercise of what little power is left in their hands as will do them but little service. The chief agents in this new form of government planned out by Convention assume the humble title of President, Senate, and Representatives, but really are vested with the powers of King, Lords, and Commons; and although the government seems to be elective, their stations will be secured as amply, I humbly conceive, as though they were made hereditary, as the rights of the electors appear to be so much fettered, as to leave but little power in the hands of the people. My particular objections are first to the third paragraph in section 2, Article 1, which is in the following words: “Representatives and direct taxes, shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included in this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined, by adding to the whole number of free persons, including [375]those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons.” Was not this form of words thus uncouthly used to avoid using the word Negroes? It certainly looks as though the word Negroes was omitted from the design. It cannot be from any fear of offending that nation of Africans. Why must that man that has 500 slaves in our Southern States, where slaves are looked upon only as personal property, have 300 of them exempted from capitation, while an inhabitant of the Northern States, possessed of the same number of horned cattle, horses, and hogs, be obliged to pay for the whole number? They are all considered as chattels. But to proceed, “The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative: and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New-Hampshire shall be permitted to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New-Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North-Carolina five, South-Carolina five, and Georgia three.” My objections to this part of the paragraph are that the representation is by far too small to transact the business of so large an empire. Our state assemblies may be annihilated, having nothing to do of importance; the power of taxation being vested in Congress, all other business may be transacted in our town meetings. A large representation has ever been esteemed by the best Whigs in Great Britain the best barrier against bribery and corruption, and yet we find a British king, having the disposition of all places, civil and military, and an immense revenue, SQUEEZED out of the very mouths of his wretched subjects, is able to corrupt the Parliament, to vote him any supplies he demands, to support armies, to defend the prerogatives of his crown, and carry fire and sword by his fleets and armies, to desolate whole provinces in the Eastern World, to aggrandize himself, and satisfy the avarice of his tyrannical subjects. No wonder our American ambassador, struck with the brilliancy of the British Court where everything around St. James’s wears the appearance of wealth, ease, and plenty, should imagine a three-branched legislature only can produce these effects and make the subjects happy, should write a book in favor of such a government and send it over for the illumination of this Western World.2 If this is the sole fruit of his embassy, America will not canonize him for a saint on account of his services, when they have experienced the consequences of such a kind of government as he has planned out. In order to have formed a right judgment, he should have looked into the ditches which serve for graves for many of the human race—under hedges which serve as dreary habitations for the living—into the [376]cottages of the poor and miserable, and critically examine with how much parsimony the mechanics, the day laborers, cottagers, and villagers live in order to support their high-pampered lords, before he had wrote a book to persuade his country to pursue the same road to greatness, splendor, and glory, and have reflected in his own mind, whether he could wish to see that country which gave him birth reduced to the same situation. By this arrangement of representation it seems this large and extensive empire, which in half a century will probably be double in number to the inhabitants of Great Britain, will be governed by 68 Representatives, of which six of the Northern States will be represented by 27 ONLY, and the Southern States by 41. No marvel that three-fifths of the slaves are exempted from capitation in taxation. The Commons of England, if my memory serves me, consists of 5 or 600 or upwards, yet the king of Great Britain, if we may believe their own writers, has it in his power by places and pensions to corrupt a majority of his Commons, that his ministers can carry any vote they think proper to propose to support the dignity of his crown and rapaciousness of his ministers. Therefore, should Congress at any future period grow haughty, insolent, and oppressive, they will have it in their power by places and pensions, which they are amply enabled to establish by the sale of the western lands, which by this Constitution is wholly resigned into the hands of Congress, to be at their disposal, which will be sufficient to corrupt a house of representatives double in number to the Commons of Great Britain. I now would make my objection to section 4th which is in these words: “The times, places, and manner of holding election for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time alter or make such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.” The plain meaning and understanding of which I take to be this, that Congress gives liberty to the assemblies of each state to make such regulations respecting the time, place, and manner of choosing Senators and Representatives. But if they do not improve it to their liking, they can alter it at pleasure, except the place of choosing. This is a most liberal and extensive favor granted to the assemblies of these states, which Congress can again at any time at pleasure revoke; therefore it will be prudent to use that liberty, and choose such Senators as shall be acceptable to Congress, or they may expect pretty soon to have such rules prescribed them, as to the time and manner, as will better comport with the views and designs of Congress, when modeled according to their NEW PLAN—prescribed by Convention. Passing over many lesser matters, I proceed to section [377]7, which is in these words: “All bills for raising a revenue shall originate in the house of representatives; but the SENATE may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.” I would here only observe that the Commons of Great Britain will not suffer the House of Lords to make the least alteration in a money bill; however, the Crown has found means to corrupt a sufficient number of the Commons to draw forth the blood and treasure of the nation. I now proceed to section 8, in these words: “The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, and excises to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.” And the second paragraph of the 3d section, Article 4th, contains these words: “The Congress shall have power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory and other property belonging to the United States.” By the first recited paragraph, we vest Congress with full power to lay and collect, by their own authority, what taxes, duties, and excises they please; and by the second, we surrender into the hands of Congress all the western territory, of larger extent, I conceive, than the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland—the richness of the soil, let those who have seen it declare. But so concise, and so ample a conveyance of such an extent of territory, couched in such smooth and easy language I never before read. I was so struck with the elegance of the style, I never once thought of its being a conveyance of land until I had read it over three or four times. Now I submit it to the good sense of the people of these states, whether it is prudent we should make so liberal and extensive a grant of power and property to any body of men in these United States, before they have ever informed the public the amount of the public debt, or what the annual expenses of the federal government is or will be. It is now almost five years since the peace; and Congress has employed thirteen commissioners, at 1500 dollars per annum, as I am informed, to settle the public accounts, and we know now no more what the national debt is than at the first moment of their appointment. Nor do we know any more what is the amount of the annual expenses of the federal government than we do of the empire of China. To grant therefore such an ample power of taxation, and the right of soil, to the amount of millions, upon the recommendation of this Honorable Convention, without either knowing the amount of the national debt or the annual expenses of government, would not argue, in my opinion, the highest degree of prudence."
Letter,No,Elbridge Gerry,James Warren,,,10/18/1787,"I expected e’er this to have been in Massachusetts but am detained here longer than I expected—I inclose some papers on the subject of the Constitution to be reprinted if you think it convenient.

Letter,No,Elbridge Gerry,General Council,,,10/18/1787,"Gentlemen I have the honor to inclose, pursuant to my Commission, the constitution proposed by the Fœderal Convention.1 To this system I gave my dissent, & shall submit my objections to the honorable Legislature It was painful for me, on a subject of such national importance, to differ from the respectable Members who signed the constitution: but conceiving as I did, that the liberties of America were not secured by the system, it was my duty to oppose it— My principal objections to the plan, are that there is no adequate provision for a representation of the People—that they have no security for the right of election—that some of the powers of the Legislature are ambiguous, & others indefinite & dangerous2—that the executive is blended with & will have an undue influence over the legislature—that the Judicial department will be oppressive—that treaties of the highest importance may be formed by the president with [99]the advice of two thirds of a quorum of the Senate—& that the System is without the Security of a Bill of rights, these are objections which are not local, but apply equally to all the States— As the Convention was called for “the sole & express purpose of revising the articles of confederation, & reporting to Congress & the several Legislatures such alterations & provisions as shall render the fœderal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government, & the preservation of the union,”3 I did not conceive that these powers extended to the formation of the plan proposed, but the Convention being of a different opinion, I acquiesced in it, being fully convinced that to preserve the union, an efficient Government was indispensibly necessary; & that it would be difficult to make proper amendments to the articles of confederation. The Constitution proposed has few, if any Fœderal features, but is rather a system of national government: nevertheless, in many respects I think it has great merit, & by proper amendments, may be adapted to the “exigencies of Government” & preservation of Liberty. The question on this plan involves others of the highest importance 1st Whether there shall be a dissolution of the Fœderal Government? 2dly Whether the several State Governments shall be so altered, as in effect to be dissolved? and 3dly Whether in lieu of the Fœderal & state Governments, the national constitution now proposed shall be substituted without amendment? never perhaps were a people called on to decide a question of greater magnitude—should the Citizens of America adopt the plan as it now stands, their liberties may be lost: or should they reject it altogether Anarchy may ensue, it is evident therefore that they should not be precipitate in their decissions; that the subject should be well understood, lest they should refuse to support the Government, after having hastily accepted it. If those who are in favour of the Constitution, as well as those who are against it, should preserve moderation, their discussions may afford much information & finally direct to an happy issue. It may be urged by some, that an implicit confidence should be placed in the Convention: but however respectable the members may be who signed the constitution, it must be admitted, that a free people are the proper Guardians of their rights & liberties—that the greatest men may err—& that their errors are sometimes, of the greatest magnitude. Others may suppose, that the constitution may be safely adopted, because therein provision is made to amend it: but cannot this object be better attained before a ratification than after it? and should a free people, adopt a form of Government, under conviction that it wants amendment? [100] And some may conceive, that if the Plan is not accepted by the people they will not unite in another: but surely whilst they have the power to amend, they are not under the necessity of rejecting it. I have been detained here longer than I expected, but shall leave this place in a day or two for Massachusetts, & on my arrival shall submit the reasons (if required by the Legislature) on which my objections are grounded. I shall only add, that as the Welfare of the union requires a better Constitution than the confederation, I shall think it my duty as a Citizen of Massachusetts to support that which shall be finally adopted, sincerely hoping it will secure the Liberty & happiness of America. I have the Honor to be Gentlemen with the highest respect for the honorable Legislature & yourselves, your most obedt & very hum servt E Gerry"

In proportion as he loves his fellow creatures, he must here admire and approve; for while they have severally laid their foundations in the blood and slaughter of three, four, and sometimes, ten successive generations, from their passions have experience[d], every misery to which human nature is subject, and at this day present striking features of usurped power, unequal justice, and despotic tyranny, America stands completely systemised without any of these misfortunes.—On the contrary, from the first settlement of the country, the necessity of civil associations, founded upon equality, consent, and proportionate justice have ever been universally acknowledged.—The means of education always attended to, and the fountains of science brought within the reach of poverty.—Hitherto we have commenced society, and advanced in all respects resembling a family, without partial affections, or even a domestic bickering: And if we consider her as an individual, instead of an undue proportion of violent passions and bad habits, we must set her down possessed of reason, genius and virtue.—I premise these few [110]observations because there are too many among us of narrow minds, who live in the practice of blasting the reputation of their own country.—They hold it as a maxim, that virtues cannot grow in their own soil.—They will appreciate those of a man, they know nothing about, because he is an exotic; while they are sure to depreciate those much more brilliant in their neighbours, because they are really acquainted with and know them. Civil society is a blessing.—It is here universally known as such.—The education of every child in this country tends to promote it.—There is scarcely a citizen in America who does not wish to bring it, consistent with our situation and circumstances, to its highest state of improvement.—Nay, I may say further, that the people in general aim to effect this point, in a peaceable, laudable, and rational way. These assertions are proved by stubborn facts, and I need only resort to that moment, when, in contest with a powerful enemy, they paid such an unprecedented attention to civilization, as to select from among themselves their different conventions, and form their several constitutions, which, for their beautiful theoretical structure, caught the admiration of our enemies, and secured to us the applause of the world.—We at this day feel the effects of this disposition, and now live under a government of our own choice, constructed by ourselves, upon unequivocal principles, and requires but to be well administ[e]red to make us as happy under it as generally falls to the lot of humanity. The disturbances in the course of the year past cannot be placed as an objection to the principle I advance.—They took their rise in idleness, extravagance and misinformation, a want of knowledge of our several finances, a universal delusion at the close of the war, and in consequence thereof, a pressure of embarrassments, which checked, and in many cases, destroyed that disposition of forbearance, which ought to be exercised towards each other. These were added to the accursed practice of letting money at usury, and some few real difficulties and grievances, which our late situation unavoidably brought upon us. The issue of them, however, rather proves the position for, a very few irreclaimables excepted, we find even an anxiety to hearken to reason pervading all classes—industry and frugality increasing, and the advantages arising from good, wholesome laws, confessed by every one.—Let who will gain say it, I am confident we are in a much better situation, in all respects, than we were at this period the last year; and as fast as can be expected, consistent with the passions and habits of a free people, of men who will think for themselves, coalescing, as a correspondent observes in a late paper, under a firm, wise and efficient government.2 The powers vested in Congress have hitherto been found inadequate.—Who are [111]those that have been against investing them? The people of this Commonwealth have very generally supposed it expedient, and the farmer equally with the merchant have taken steps to effect it.—A Convention from the different States for that sole purpose hath been appointed of their most respectable citizens—respectable indeed I may say for their equity, for their literature, and for their love of their country.—Their proceedings are now before us for our approbation.—The eagerness with which they have been received by certain classes of our fellow citizens, naturally forces upon us this question? Are we to adopt this Government, without an examination?—Some there are, who, literally speaking, are for pressing it upon us at all events. The name of the man who but lisps a sentiment in objection to it, is to be handed to the printer, by the printer to the publick, and by the publick he is to be led to execution.3 They are themselves stabbing its reputation. For my part, I am a stranger to the necessity for all this haste! Is it not a subject of some small importance? Certainly it is.—Are not your lives, your liberties and properties intimately involved in it?—Certainly they are. Is it a government for a moment, a day, or a year? By no means—but for ages—Altered it may possibly be, but it is easier to correct before it is adopted.—Is it for a family, a state, or a small number of people? It is for a number no less respectable than three millions. Are the enemy at our gates, and have we not time to consider it? Certainly we have. Is it so simple in its form as to be comprehended instantly?—Every letter, if I may be allowed the expression, is an idea. Does it consist of but few additions to our present confederation, and those which have been from time to time described among us, and known to be necessary?—Far otherwise.—It is a compleat system of government, and armed with every power, that a people in any circumstances ought to bestow. It is a path newly struck out, and a new set of ideas are introduced that have neither occurred or been digested.—A government for national purposes, preserving our constitution entire, hath been the only plan hitherto agitated. I do not pretend to say, but it is in theory the most unexceptionable, and in practice will be the most conducive to our happiness of any possible to be adopted:—But it ought to undergo a candid and strict examination. It is the duty of every one in the Commonwealth to communicate his sentiments to his neighbour, divested of passion, and equally so of prejudices. If they are honest and he is a real friend to his country, he will do it and embrace every opportunity to do it. If thoroughly looked into before it is adopted, the people will be more apt to approve of it in practice, and every man is a TRAITOR to himself and his posterity, who shall ratify it with his signature, without first endeavouring to understand it.—We [112]are but yet in infancy; and we had better proceed slow than too fast.—It is much easier to dispense powers, than recall them.—The present generation will not be drawn into any system; they are too enlightened; they have not forfeited their right to a share in government, and they ought to enjoy it. Some are heard to say, “When we consider the men who made it, we ought to take it for sterling, and without hesitation—that they were the collected wisdom of the States, and had no object but the general good.”—I do not doubt all this, but facts ought not to be winked out of sight:—They were delegated from different States, and nearly equally represented, though vastly disproportionate both in wealth and numbers. They had local prejudices to combat, and in many instances, totally opposite interests to consult. Their situations, their habits, their extent, and their particular interest, varied each from the other. The gentlemen themselves acknowledge that they have been less rigid upon some points, in consequence of those difficulties than they otherwise should have been.—Others again tell you that the Convention is or will be dissolved; that we must take their proceedings in whole or reject them—But this surely cannot be a reason for their speedy adoption; it rather works the other way. If evils are acknowledged in the composition, we ought, at least, to see whose shoulders are to bear the most; to compare ours with those of other States, and take care that we are not saddled with more than our proportion: That the citizens of Philadelphia are running mad after it, can be no argument for us to do the like:—Their situation is almost contrasted with ours; they suppose themselves a central State; they expect the perpetual residence of Congress, which of itself alone will ensure their aggrandizement: We, on the contrary, are sure to be near one of the extremes; neither the loaves or fishes will be so plenty with us, or shall we be so handy to procure them.— We are told by some people, that upon the adopting this New Government, we are to become every thing in a moment:—Our foreign and domestic debts will be as a feather; our ports will be crowded with the ships of all the world, soliciting our commerce and our produce: Our manufactures will increase and multiple; and, in short, if we STAND STILL, our country, notwithstanding, will be like the blessed Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. Let us not deceive ourselves; the only excellency of any government is in exact proportion to the administration of it:—Idleness and luxury will be as much a bane as ever; our passions will be equally at war with us then as now; and if we have men among us trying with all their ability to undermine our [113]present Constitution, these very persons will direct their force to sap the vitals of the new one. Upon the whole, my fellow countrymen, I am as much a federal man as any person: In a federal union lies our political salvation—To preserve that union, and make it respectable to foreign opticks, the National Government ought to be armed with all necessary powers; but the subject I conceive of infinite delicacy, and requires both ability and reflection. In discus[s]ing points of such moment, America has nothing to do with passions or hard words; every citizen has an undoubted right to examine for himself, neither ought he to be ill treated and abused, because he does not think at the same moment exactly as we do. It is true, that many of us have but our liberties to lose, but they are dearly bought, and are not the least precious in estimation:—In the mean time, is it not of infinite consequence, that we pursue inflexibly that path, which I feel persuaded we are now approaching, wherein we shall discourage all foreign importations; shall see the necessity of greater economy and industry; shall smile upon the husbandman, and reward the industrious mechanick; shall promote the growth of our own country, and wear the produce of our own farms; and, finally, shall support measures in proportion to their honesty and wisdom, without any respect to men. Nothing more is wanted to make us happy at home, and respectable abroad."
Newspaper,No,,,Connecticut Journal,,10/24/1787,"I also object to the 9th paragraph of section 8th, which is in these words: “To constitute tribunals, inferior to the Supreme Court.” We have, I humbly conceive, law tribunals erected [378]already, which are sufficiently expensive to exhaust the wealth of our richest citizens, and humbly implore, Convention, Congress, and the assemblies of the states, not to constitute any more. The shortest, the cheapest, and the most expeditious method to obtain distributive justice, between man and man, is to be preferred in any state; and the sooner that matter is taken up, by the several legislatures of the states, to shorten law processes, the better, and unless speedily effected, we shall be speedily undone. My next objection is to the 12th paragraph of section 8th, in these words: “To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years.” A great deal of mischief may be done in two years, with guns, swords, and bayonets, and armies when once raised, it hath sometimes been found difficult to disband. I should therefore not think it prudent for Congress ever to raise an army merely to subdue Wabash Indians or any one single tribe. Should there be a general combination of all the tribes, or the states be invaded by a foreign enemy, Congress by our present Articles of Confederation are vested with full powers to draw out the military force of the states, nor have the states failed hitherto of compliance in this regard; but to limit them to two years is an affront offered to the dignity of Congress, and appears as tho we were afraid to trust the military force of the states in their hands, when there is just occasion. I take that to be one principal part of the business of Congress, to conduct the military arrangements of all the states, when judged necessary for the general safety. My next objection is to the 15th paragraph, which is in these words: “Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.” This looks too much like Baron Stuben’s militia, by which a standing army was meant and intended;3 I would only observe, to take the military force of the states out of the hands of their respective governors is a manifest indignity offered to them, as they ever have had the sole and exclusive command of the militia of the respective states. I observe the expression used is: “To execute the laws of the union.” In fact it means, to convert the militia of the states into a standing army under the entire command and control of Congress; and I would only observe further, that government and those laws which require a standing army to enforce them ought not to be supported in any nation under Heaven. My next objection is to the first paragraph of section 9th, in these words: “The migration or importation of such persons as any other states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year of 1808. But a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person.” Why this [379]sentence should be couched in this blind mysterious form of words, unless again to avoid using the word Negroes, I must leave those that drew it to explain. But should think we have no right to complain of the Algerines, who live on the coast of Africa, if they enslave the Americans whom they find sailing in those seas, if we will send our vessels across the Atlantic, of set design, to purchase, kidnap, and decoy the inhabitants of the more southern states of the globe. That man that will give his vote to import Africans for the space of 21 years, to drag out a miserable life in slavery, will vote to enslave the Americans at the end of that period. The cry has been, enlarge the powers of Congress—enable them to regulate trade; but it seems this Convention will not permit Congress to prevent the importation of slaves for 21 years yet to come. The seeming care taken to cover the true intent and meaning of this and some other parts of the doings of that Convention will be sufficient reason, in my mind, not to vote for one single paragraph it contains. I shall make one short remark more on the 8th paragraph of this section, viz.: “No title of NOBILITY shall be granted by the United States.” Congress, in our Articles of Confederation, have used the same precaution; nevertheless, the officers of the army have incorporated themselves into a society known by the name of the CINCINNATI. The views of which society have been fully laid open by the Honorable AEDANUS BURKE of South Carolina, which will, if neglected, finally terminate in NOBILITY.4 It was no doubt founded with those views, and if permitted to have their annual meetings in the manner they have begun, once in a year or oftener, it will be found they will not fail of the original design of their voluntary incorporation. Not being able to pay the grant made to officers and army, we now pay the annual interest of their grant, being in the whole £99,000, which must, till we are able to discharge the principal, be considered as a pension. The principal, I presume, never can be paid, but by the sale of the lands ceded to the states by treaty. Nor do they fail to put themselves in the most respectable light upon all public occasions; I see they convened at New Haven, at your public commencement, walked in procession with his excellency your governor, president, corporation, and tutors of your college, and the clergy of the state, and I observe were DUBBED, the honorable society of the CINCINNATI.5 Omitting many other, perhaps very exceptionable, I will just make one observation on the 7th Article which says: “The ratification of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution, between the states so ratifying the same,” I would just recommend [380]it to the members of our honorable convention, to reconcile this 7th Article with the 13th Article of our Confederation, which says: “The articles of this Confederation shall be observed by every state, and the union be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterward confirmed by the legislature of each state.” It appears as tho the Convention wholly over-looked the 13th Article of our Confederation. Another thing is obvious by this 7th Article. It seems as tho the nine Southern States had prepared their matters in such a manner that they are ready prepared to dismiss the four Northern States, if they do not think fit to adopt the doings of this Convention, and be ready organized to proceed without them, as tho it was what they expected or desired. The third paragraph in the second section has a passage of the same complexion, in these words: “Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which MAY be included within this union.” Thus I have only hinted at some of the doings of this Convention which I am able to understand; many other dark and mysterious parts of it, which are beyond my comprehension, I must leave to you and others to unfold. One thing more, however, is beyond me, which I must mention. The assemblies of the states, it seems, will not do to ratify or reject this new Constitution, but it must be done by a CONVENTION, chosen by the PEOPLE, under the recommendation of their legislatures. It is perhaps not so difficult to comprehend the meaning of this measure, as to explain it to the understanding of everyone. The other part you have assigned me, I shall attempt as soon as I can arrange my ideas properly. In the meantime, I am, etc., yours."
Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,10/24/1787,"Extract of a letter from Boston, Octob. 14. “You federalists in Pennsylvania have but secondary merit—you saw, read and approved the new form of government—we—to our honour be it spoken, were true, staunch, federal men almost before we saw it!-He must be a bold Jonathan here, that will dare to say a word against it now.—An anti-federalist and a tory are held to be one and the same, and curses in plenty are denounced on the heads of both; as the popular [318]breath allows no discrimination.—I must confess, nothing for a long time has so much alarmed me, as the endeavour of certain characters amongst us to insult the understanding of the public, by preventing that freedom of enquiry which truth and honour never dreads, but which tyrants and tyranny could never endure.—The merits of the New Constitution out of the question, the conduct of too many here respecting it is strikingly analogous to that of Lord Peter in the tale of a tub–‘Look ye, brothers Martin and Jack, if ye do not believe this crust of bread to be as good a shoulder of mutton as ever was sold in Leadenhall market, I pronounce you both a couple of blind, positive, conceited sons of bitches, and may the devil roast you to all eternity!’”"
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,10/29/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In my last address upon the proceedings of the Federal Convention, [157]I endeavored to convince you of the importance of the subject, that it required a cool, dispassionate examination, and a thorough investigation, previous to its adoption—that it was not a mere revision and amendment of our first Confederation, but a compleat System for the future government of the United States, and I may now add in preference to, and in exclusion of, all others heretofore adopted.—It is not temporary, but in its nature, PERPETUAL.—It is not designed that you shall be annually called, either to revise, correct, or renew it; but, that your posterity shall grow up under, and be governed by it, as well as ourselves.—It is not so capable of alterations as you would at the first reading suppose; and I venture to assert, it never can be, unless by force of arms. The fifth article in the proceedings, it is true, expressly provides for an alteration under certain conditions, whenever “it shall be ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress.”—Notwithstanding which, such are the “heterogeneous materials from which this System was formed,” such is the difference of interest, different manners, and different local prejudices, in the different parts of the United States, that to obtain that majority of three fourths to any one single alteration, essentially affecting this or any other State, amounts to an absolute impossibility. The conduct of the Delegates in dissolving the Convention, plainly speaks this language, and no other.—Their sentiments in their Letter to his Excellency the President of Congress are—That this Constitution was the result of a spirit of amity—that the parties came together disposed to concede as much as possible each to the other—that mutual concessions and compromises did, in fact, take place, and all those which could, consistent with the peculiarity of their political situation.2 Their dissolution enforces the same sentiment, by confining you to the alternative of taking or refusing their doings in the gross. In this view, who is there to be found among us, who can seriously assert, that this Constitution, after ratification and being practised upon, will be so easy of alteration? Where is the probability that a future Convention, in any future day, will be found possessed of a greater spirit of amity and mutual concession than the present? Where is the probability that three fourths of the States in that Convention,3 or three fourths of the Legislatures of the different States, whose interests differ scarcely in nothing short of every thing, will be so very ready or willing materially to change any part of this System, which shall be to the emolument of an individual State only? No, my fellow-citizens, as you [158]are now obliged to take it in the whole, so you must hereafter administer it in whole, without the prospect of change, unless by again reverting to a state of Nature, which will be ever opposed with success by those who approve of the Government in being. That the want of a Bill of Rights to accompany this proposed System, is a solid objection to it, provided there is nothing exceptionable in the System itself, I do not assert.—If, however, there is at any time, a propriety in having one, it would not have been amiss here. A people, entering into society, surrender such a part of their natural rights, as shall be necessary for the existence of that society. They are so precious in themselves, that they would never be parted with, did not the preservation of the remainder require it. They are entrusted in the hands of those, who are very willing to receive them, who are naturally fond of exercising of them, and whose passions are always striving to make a bad use of them.—They are conveyed by a written compact, expressing those which are given up, and the mode in which those reserved shall be secured. Language is so easy of explanation, and so difficult is it by words to convey exact ideas, that the party to be governed cannot be too explicit. The line cannot be drawn with too much precision and accuracy. The necessity of this accuracy and this precision encreases in proportion to the greatness of the sacrifice and the numbers who make it.—That a Constitution for the United States does not require a Bill of Rights, when it is considered, that a Constitution for an individual State would, I cannot conceive.—The difference between them is only in the numbers of the parties concerned; they are both a compact between the Governors and Governed, the letter of which must be adhered to in discussing their powers. That which is not expressly granted, is of course retained. The Compact itself is a recital upon paper of that proportion of the subject’s natural rights, intended to be parted with, for the benefit of adverting to it in case of dispute. Miserable indeed would be the situation of those individual States who have not prefixed to their Constitutions a Bill of Rights, if, as a very respectable, learned Gentleman at the Southward observes, “the People, when they established the powers of legislation under their separate Governments, invested their Representatives with every right and authority which they did not, in explicit terms, reserve; and therefore upon every question, respecting the jurisdiction of the House of Assembly, if the Frame of Government is silent, the jurisdiction is efficient and complete.”4 In other words, those powers which the people by their Constitutions expressly give them, they enjoy by positive grant, and those remaining ones, which they never meant to give them, and which the Constitutions say nothing [159]about, they enjoy by tacit implication, so that by one means and by the other, they became possessed of the whole.—This doctrine is but poorly calculated for the meridian of America, where the nature of compact, the mode of construing them, and the principles upon which society is founded, are so accurately known and universally diffused. That insatiable thirst for unconditional controul over our fellow-creatures, and the facility of sounds to convey essentially different ideas, produced the first Bill of Rights ever prefixed to a Frame of Government. The people, altho’ fully sensible that they reserved every tittle of power they did not expressly grant away, yet afraid that the words made use of, to express those rights so granted might convey more than they originally intended, they chose at the same moment to express in different language those rights which the agreement did not include, and which they never designed to part with, endeavoring thereby to prevent any cause for future altercation and the intrusion into society of that doctrine of tacit implication which has been the favorite theme of every tyrant from the origin of all governments to the present day. The proceedings of the Convention are new handed to you by your Legislature, and the second Wednesday in January is appointed for your final answer. To enable you to give that with propriety; that your future reflections may produce peace, however opposed the present issue of your present conduct may be to your present expectations, you must determine, that, in order to support with dignity the Federal Union, it is proper and fit, that the present Confederation shall be annihilated:—That the future Congress of the United States shall be armed with the powers of Legislation, Judgment and Execution:—That annual elections in this Congress shall not be known, and the most powerful body, the Senate, in which a due proportion of representation is not preserved, and in which the smallest State has equal weight with the largest, be the longest in duration:—That it is not necessary for the publick good, that persons habituated to the exercise of power should ever be reminded from whence they derive it, by a return to the station of private citizens, but that they shall at all times at the expiration of the term for which they were elected to an office, be capable of immediate re-election to that same office:—That you will hereafter risque the probability of having the Chief Executive Branch chosen from among you; and that it is wholly indifferent, both to you and your children after you, whether this future Government shall be administered within the territories of your own State, or at the distance of four thousand miles from them.—You must also determine, that they shall have the exclusive power of imposts and the duties on imports and exports, the power of laying excises and other duties, and the [160]additional power of laying internal taxes upon your lands, your goods, your chattels, as well as your persons at their sovereign pleasure:—That the produce of these several funds shall be appropriated to the use of the United States, and collected by their own officers, armed with a military force, if a civil aid should not prove sufficient:—That the power of organizing, arming and disciplining the militia shall be lodged in them, and this thro’ fear that they shall not be sufficiently attentive to keeping so respectable a body of men as the yeomanry of this Commonwealth, compleatly armed, organized and disciplined; they shall have also the power of raising, supporting and establishing a standing army in time of peace in your several towns, and I see not why in your several houses:—That should an insurrection or an invasion, however small, take place, in Georgia, the extremity of the Continent, it is highly expedient they should have the power of suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus in Massachusetts, and as long as they shall judge the public safety requires it:—You must also say, that your present Supreme Judicial Court shall be an Inferior Court to a Continental Court, which is to be inferior to the Supreme Court of the United States:—That from an undue biass which they are supposed to have for the citizens of their own States, they shall not be competent to determine title to your real estate, disputes which may arise upon a protested Bill of Exchange, a simple note of hand, or book debt, wherein your citizens shall be unfortunately involved with disputes of such or any other kind, with citizens either of other States or foreign States: In all such cases they shall have a right to carry their causes to the Supreme Court of the United States, whether for delay only or vexation; however distant from the place of your abode, or inconsistent with your circumstances:—That such appeals shall be extended to matters of fact as well as law, and a trial of the cause by jury you shall not have a right to insist upon.—In short, my fellow-citizens, previous to a capacity of giving a compleat answer to their proceedings, you must determine that the Constitution of your Commonwealth, which is instructive, beautiful and consistent in practice, which has been justly admired in Europe, as a model of perfection, and which the present Convention have affected to imitate, a Constitution which is especially calculated for your territory, and is made conformable to your genius, your habits, the mode of holding your estates, and your particular interests, shall be reduced in its powers to those of a City Corporation:—The skeleton of it may remain, but its vital principle shall be transferred to the new Government: Nay, you must go still further, and agree to invest the new Congress with powers, which you have yet thought proper to withhold from your own present [161]Government.—All these, and more, which are contained in the proceedings of the Federal Convention, may be highly proper and necessary.—In this overturn of all individual Governments, in this new-fashioned set of ideas, and in this total dereliction of those sentiments which animated us in 1775, the Political Salvation of the United States may be very deeply interested, but BE CAUTIOUS."
Newspaper,No,Vox Populi,,Massachusetts Gazette,,10/30/1787,"As the proposed Federal Constitution is now before the impartial publick, for their approbation or disallowance, I conceive it to be the [169]duty, as well as the PRIVILEGE of each and every citizen of this commonwealth to investigate the matter fully, and ripen his mind for a suitable answer to the important question; and when he has thus furnished his own judgment, I conceive he has, at least, a right to hold up his sentiments to publick view, and throw all the light he is capable of before the publick; and in case of any doubt in his own mind with regard to said Constitution, or any part thereof, he may undoubtedly worth such doubts before the publick, that they may be publickly taken up and obviated. These things premised, I beg leave to lay before the candid publick the first clause in the fourth section of the first article of the proposed Constitution.— “The times, places and manner of holding elections, for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations—except as to the places of choosing senators.” By this clause, the time, place and manner of choosing representatives is wholly at the disposal of Congress. Why the Convention, who formed the proposed Constitution, wished to invest Congress with such a power, I am by no means capable of saying; or why the good people of this commonwealth should delegate such a power to them, is no less hard to determine.—But as the subject is open for discussion, I shall make a little free inquiry into the matter. And, first. What national advantage is there to be acquired by giving them such a power? The only advantage which I have heard proposed by it is, to prevent a partial representation of the several states in Congress; “for if the time, manner and place were left wholly in the hands of the state legislatures, it is probable they would not make provision by appointing time, manner and place for election; in which case there could be no election, and consequently the federal government weakened.” But this provision is by no means sufficient to prevent an evil of that nature; for will any reasonable man suppose, that when the legislature of any state, who are annually chosen, are so corrupt as to break thro’ that government which they have formed, and refuse to appoint time, place and manner of choosing representatives—I say, can any person suppose, that a state, so corrupt, would not be full as likely to neglect, or even refuse, to choose representatives at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by Congress? Surely they would.—So it could answer no good national purpose on that account; and I have not heard any other national advantage proposed thereby. We will now proceed, in the next place, to consider why the people of this commonwealth should vest Congress with such a power.— No one proposes that it would be any advantage to the people of this state; therefore, it must be considered as a matter of indifference, except there is an opportunity for its operating to their disadvantage: in which case, I conceive it ought to be disapprobated. Whether there is danger of its operating to the good people’s disadvantage, shall now be the subject of our inquiry.— Supposing Congress should direct, that the representatives of this commonwealth should be chosen all in one town, (Boston, for instance) on the first day of March—would not that be a very injurious institution to the good people of this commonwealth?—Would not there be at least nine-tenths of the landed interest of this commonwealth intirely unrepresented? Surely one may reasonably imagine there would. What, then, would be the case if Congress should think proper to direct, that the elections should be held at the north-west, south-west or north-east part of the state, the last day of March? How many electors would there attend the business?—And it is a little remarkable, that any gentleman should suppose, that Congress could possibly be in any measure as good judges of the time, place and manner of elections as the legislatures of the several respective states. These as objections I could wish to see obviated:—And I could wish the publick inquiry might extend to a consideration, whether or no it would not be more conducive, to prevent a partial representation, to invest Congress with power to levy such a fine as they might think proper on states not choosing representatives, than by giving them this power of appointing time, manner and place. It is objected by some, that Congress could not levy, or, at least, could not collect, such a fine of a delinquent state. If that is the case, Congress could not collect any tax they might think proper to levy, nor execute any order whatever; but at any time any state might break through the national compact, dissolve the federal constitution, and set the whole structure afloat on the ocean of chaos. It is, therefore, proposed to the publick to consider, whether the said clause in the fourth section of the first article can answer the only purposes for which it is said to have been provided, or any other which will prove any advantage either to the nation or state. Boston, Oct. 29."
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Gazette,,10/30/1787,"FEDERAL CONSTITUTION Heaven (says a correspondent) seems preparing America for greatness and importance, by graditions, that no nation in the world were ever blessed with. When her rights were infringed by an ungrateful mother, it diffused a spirit of liberty and virtue.—When foreign mercenaries, aided by a parent’s sword, threatened havock and desolation, numerous armies, from hidden sources, were brought into existence and led on to victory and success. When the avarice of foreign powers thwarted the natural system of commerce, and eternal corruptions enervated the principles of government, and brought us to the alarming crisis of pusillanimously expecting some bold usurper to assume the reigns and sport with the invaluable rights of men, the goodness of our God was truly apparent in having influenced the people to constitute a convention to remedy these disorders, and in leading them on to [172]organise a government upon the lasting basis of liberty and order. This is the seed-time of union—the state that should be now unfederal will plunge herself into merited disgrace, if not annihilation.1 A writer on politicks observes, that doctor Price has been so uniform a friend to the United States, there is no doubt he will take infinite pains to shew us whether we ought, or ought not, to adopt the new constitution, and therefore it is proposed, that not a single thing be said, written, or done upon the subject till that gentleman’s opinion arrives. A certain party however will be averse to this plan, as the doctor cannot recommend the conventional work consistently with his enthusiastick encomiums upon the republican systems of the states;2—unless indeed, he pursues the mode invented by our ingenuous minister,3 and under the title of “a defence of the present confederation of America,” writes a treatise in favour of the plan which has been proposed as a substitute.4 Perhaps this country (says a writer in a late paper) never saw so critical a period in their political concerns. We have felt the feebleness of the ties by which these United States are held together, and the want of sufficient energy in our present confederation, to manage, in some instances, our general concerns. Various expedients have been proposed to remedy these evils, but none have succeeded. At length a Convention of the states has been assembled, they have formed a constitution which will now, probably, be submitted to the people to ratify or reject, who are the fountain of all power, to whom alone it of right belongs to make or unmake constitutions or forms of government, at their pleasure. The most important question that was ever proposed to your decision, or to the decision of any people under heaven, is before you, and you are to decide upon it by men of your own election, chosen specially for this purpose. If the constitution, offered to your acceptance, be a wise one, calculated to preserve the invaluable blessings of liberty, to secure the inestimable rights of mankind, and promote human happiness, then, if you accept it, you will lay a lasting foundation of happiness for millions yet unborn; generations to come will rise up and call you blessed.5 You may rejoice in the prospects of this vast extended continent becoming filled with freemen, who will assert the dignity of human nature. You may solace yourselves with the idea, that society, in this favoured land, will fast advance to the highest point of perfection, the human mind will expand in knowledge and virtue, and the golden age be, in some measure, realized. But if, on the other hand, this form of government contains principles that will lead to the subversion of liberty—if it tends to establish a despotism, or, what is worse, a tyrannick aristocracy; then, if you adopt it, this only remaining [173]asylum for liberty will be shut up, and posterity will execrate your memory.6"
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,11/5/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. CIVIL LIBERTY, in all countries, hath been promoted by a free discussion of publick measures, and the conduct of publick men. The FREEDOM OF THE PRESS hath, in consequence thereof, been esteemed one of its safe guards. That freedom gives the right, at all times, to every citizen to lay his sentiments, in a decent manner, before the people. If he will take that trouble upon himself, whether they are in point or not, his countrymen are obliged to him for so doing; for, at least, they lead to an examination of the subject upon which he writes.—If any possible situation makes it a duty, it is our present important one, for in the course of sixty or ninety days you are to approve of or reject the present proceedings of your Convention, which, if established, will certainly effect, in a greater or less degree, during the remainder of your lives, those privileges which you esteem dear to you, and not improbably those of your children for succeeding ages. Now therefore is unquestionably the proper time to examine it, and see if it really is what, upon paper, it appears to be. If with your eyes open, you deliberately accept it, however different it may prove in practice from what it appears in theory, you will have nobody to blame but yourselves; and what is infinitely worse, as I have before endeavoured to observe to you, you will be wholly without a remedy. It has many zealous advocates, and they have attempted, at least as far as their modesty would permit, to monopolize our gazettes, with their encomiums upon it. With the people they have to manage, I would hint to them, their zeal is not their best weapon, and exertions of such a kind, artful attempts to seize the moment, do seldom tend either to elucidate and explain principles, or ensure success. Such conduct ought to be an additional stimulous for those persons who are not its professed admirers, to speak their sentiments with freedom however unpopular.—Such [195]conduct ought to inspire caution, for as a man is invariably known by his company, so is the tendency of principles known by their advocates—Nay, it ought to lead you to enquire who are its advocates? Whether ambitious men throughout America, waiting with impatience to make it a stepping stone to posts of honour and emolument, are not of this class? Whether men who openly profess to be tired of republican governments, and sick to the heart of republican measures; who daily ridicule a government of choice, and pray ardently for one of force, are not of the same class? And, whether there are not men among us, who disapprove of it only because it is not an absolute monarchy, but who, upon the whole, are among its advocates?—In such examinations as these, you cannot mispend a proportion of the sixty days. All contracts are to be construed according to the meaning of the parties at the time of making them. By which is meant, that mutual communications shall take place, and each shall explain to the other their ideas of the contract before them.—If any unfair practices are made use of, if its real tendency is concealed by either party, or any advantage taken in the execution of it, it is in itself fraudulent and may be avoided. There is no difference in the constitution of government—Consent it is allowed is the spring—The form is the mode in which the people choose to direct their affairs, and the magistrates are but trustees to put that mode in force.—It will not be denied, that this people, of any under Heaven, have a right of living under a government of their own choosing.—That government, originally consented to, which is in practice, what it purports to be in theory, is a government of choice; on the contrary, that which is essentially different in practice, from its appearance in theory, however it may be in letter a government of choice, it never can be so in spirit. Of this latter kind appear to me to be the proceedings of the Federal Convention—They are presented as a Frame of Government purely Republican, and perfectly consistent with the individual governments in the Union. It is declared to be constructed for national purposes only, and not calculated to interfere with domestic concerns. You are told, that the rights of the people are very amply secured, and when the wheels of it are put in motion, it will wear a milder aspect than its present one. Whereas the very contrary of all this doctrine appears to be true. Upon an attentive examination you can pronounce it nothing less, than a government which in a few years, will degenerate to a compleat Aristocracy, armed with powers unnecessary in any case to bestow, and which in its vortex swallows up every other Government upon the Continent. In short, my fellow-citizens, it can be said to be nothing less than a hasty stride to Universal [196]Empire in this Western World, flattering, very flattering to young ambitious minds, but fatal to the liberties of the people. The cord is strained to the very utmost.—There is every spice of the Sic. Jubeo1 possible in the composition. Your consent is requested, because it is essential to the introduction of it; after having received confirmation, your complaints may encrease the whistling of the wind, and they will be equally regarded. It cannot be doubted at this day by any men of common sense, that there is a charm in politicks. That persons who enter reluctantly into office become habituated, grow fond of it, and are loath to resign it.—They feel themselves flattered and elevated, and are apt to forget their constituents, until the time returns that they again feel the want of them.—They uniformly exercise all the powers granted to them, and ninety-nine in a hundred are for grasping at more. It is this passionate thirst for power, which has produced different branches to exercise different departments and mutual checks upon those branches. The aristocratical hath ever been found to have the most influence, and the people in most countries have been particularly attentive in providing checks against it. Let us see if it is the case here.—A President, a Senate, and a House of Representatives are proposed. The Judicial Department is at present out of the question, being seperated excepting in impeachments. The Legislative is divided between the People who are the Democratical, and the Senate who are the Aristocratical part, and the Executive between the same Senate and the President who represents the Monarchical Branch—In the construction of this System, their interests are put in opposite scales. If they are exactly balanced, the Government will remain perfect; if there is a prepondency, it will finally prevail. After the first four years, each Senator will hold his seat for the term of six years. This length of time will be amply sufficient of itself to remove any checks that he may have upon his independency, from the fear of a future election. He will consider that it is a serious portion of his life after the age of thirty; that places of honour and trust are not generally obtained unsolicited. The same means that placed him there may be again made use of; his influence and his abilities arising from his opportunities, will, during the whole term encrease these means; he will have a compleat negative upon all laws that shall be general, or that shall favor individuals, and a voice in the appointment of all officers in the United States.—Thus habituated to power, and living in the daily practice of granting favors and receiving solicitations, he may hold himself compleatly independent of the people, and at the same time ensure his election. If there remains even a risque, the blessed assistance of a little well-distributed money, will remove it. With respect to the Executive, the Senate excepting in nomination, have a negative upon the President, and if we but a moment attend to their situation and to his, and to the power of persuasion over the human mind, especially when employed in behalf of friends and favorit[e]s, we cannot hesitate to say, that he will be infinitely less apt to disoblige them, than they to refuse him. It is far easier for twenty to gain over one, than one twenty; besides, in the one case, we can ascertain where the denial comes from, and the other we cannot. It is also highly improbable but some of the members, perhaps a major part, will hold their seats during their lives. We see it daily in our own Government, and we see it in every Government we are acquainted with, however many the cautions, and however frequent the elections. These considerations, added to their share above mentioned in the Executive department must give them a decided superiority over the House of Representatives.—But that superiority is greatly enhanced, when we consider the difference of time for which they are chosen. They will have become adepts in the mystery of administration, while the House of Representatives may be composed perhaps two thirds of members, just entering into office, little used to the course of business, and totally unacquainted with the means made use of to accomplish it.—Very possible also in a country where they are total strangers.—But, my fellow-citizens, the important question here arises, who are this House of Representatives? “A representative Assembly, says the celebrated Mr. Adams, is the sense of the people, and the perfection of the portrait, consists in the likeness.”2—Can this Assembly be said to contain the sense of the people?—Do they resemble the people in any one single feature?—Do you represent your wants, your grievances, your wishes, in person? If that is impracticable, have you a right to send one of your townsmen for that purpose?—Have you a right to send one from your county? Have you a right to send more than one for every thirty thousand of you? Can he be presumed knowing to your different, peculiar situations—your abilities to pay publick taxes, when they ought to be abated, and when encreased? Or is there any possibility of giving him information? All these questions must be answered in the negative. But how are these men to be chosen? Is there any other way than by dividing the State into districts? May not you as well at once invest your annual Assemblies with the power of choosing them—where is the essential difference? The nature of the thing will admit of none. Nay, you give them the power to prescribe the mode. They may invest it in themselves.—If you choose them yourselves, you must take them upon credit, and elect those persons you know only by common fame. Even this privilege is denied you annually, through fear that you [198]might withhold the shadow of controul over them. In this view of the System, let me sincerely ask you, where is the people in this House of Representatives?—Where is the boasted popular part of this much admired System?—Are they not couzin germans3 in every sense to the Senate? May they not with propriety be termed an Assistant Aristocratical Branch, who will be infinitely more inclined to co-operate and compromise with each other, than to be the careful guardians of the rights of their constituents? Who is there among you would not start at being told, that instead of your present House of Representatives, consisting of members chosen from every town, your future Houses were to consist of but ten in number, and these to be chosen by districts?—What man among you would betray his country and approve of it? And yet how infinitely preferable to the plan proposed?—In the one case the elections would be annual, the persons elected would reside in the center of you, their interests would be yours, they would be subject to your immediate controul, and nobody to consult in their deliberations—But in the other, they are chosen for double the time, during which, however well disposed, they become strangers to the very people choosing them, they reside at a distance from you, you have no controul over them, you cannot observe their conduct, and they have to consult and finally be guided by twelve other States, whose interests are, in all material points, directly opposed to yours. Let me again ask you, What citizen is there in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that would deliberately consent laying aside the mode proposed, that the several Senates of the several States, should be the popular Branch, and together, form one National House of Representatives?—And yet one moment’s attention will evince to you, that this blessed proposed Representation of the People, this apparent faithful Mirror, this striking Likeness, is to be still further refined, and more Aristocratical four times told.—Where now is the exact ballance which has been so diligently attended to? Where lies the security of the people? What assurances have they that either their taxes will not be exacted but in the greatest emergencies, and then sparingly, or that standing armies will be raised and supported for the very plausible purpose only of cantoning them upon their frontiers? There is but one answer to these questions.—They have none. Nor was it intended by the makers they should have, for meaning to make a different use of the latter, they never will be at a loss for ways and means to expend the former. They do not design to beg a second time. Knowing the danger of frequent applications to the people, they ask for the whole at once, and are now by their conduct, teazing and absolutely haunting of you into a compliance.—If you choose all these things should take place, by all means [199]gratify them. Go, and establish this Government, which is unanimously confessed imperfect, yet incapable of alteration. Intrust it to men, subject to the same unbounded passions and infirmities as yourselves, possessed with an insatiable thirst for power, and many of them, carrying in them vices, tho’ tinsel’d and concealed, yet, in themselves, not less dangerous than those more naked and exposed. But in the mean time, add an additional weight to the stone that now covers the remains of the Great WARREN and MONTGOMERY;4 prepare an apology for the blood and treasure, profusely spent to obtain those rights which you now so tamely part with. Conceal yourselves from the ridicule of your enemies, and bring your New-England spirits to a level with the contempt of mankind. Henceforth you may sit yourselves down with propriety, and say, Blessed are they that never expect, for they shall not be disappointed."
Newspaper,No,Vox Populi,,Massachusetts Gazette,Examiner,11/6/1787,"A CARD. Mr. Vox Populi presents his most respectful compliments to mr. Examiner, returns him thanks for the attention he has paid his piece on the Constitution—is obliged to him for the candour he has discovered on the occasion, but is under the disagreeable necessity of informing him, that he apprehends he has done nothing towards obviating the doubts and scruples with which his mind was agitated with regard to the proposed Constitution. Mr. Examiner was wholly right when he asserts Vox Populi’s objections to the Constitution were founded on jealousy and distrust, for all doubts, scruples or objections against any form of government whatever, MUST, in the nature of things, be founded in jealousy and distrust, and NOTHING else. Mr. Examiner doubtless imagined, that the introducing the reprobated words, jealousy and distrust, would be fully sufficient to silence all Vox Populi’s doubts, but he will be convinced to the contrary when he [201]considers that jealousy and distrust are by no means so heinous things as some may imagine, for all governments in existence (how ever great blessings they are) originated entirely from jealousy and distrust, as did also all deeds, bonds, receipts, notes, &c. &c. &c. And all mr. Examiner has said on this subject, will apply with equal force against all the governments established in the world, and even against the jealous and distrustful practice of taking deeds, bonds, notes, &c. Mr. Examiner proceeds rather to ridicule Vox Populi’s scruples with regard to the proposed Constitution, by giving an instance where more danger lay, than in the article objected to by Vox Populi: but can he imagine that can be any reason why the constitution should be adopted? Vox Populi had other objections against the Constitution, but he thought it was best to lay one before the publick at first, and see how that would be obviated, and when he considers mr. Examiner’s abilities as well as his inclination, he concludes it is not in his power (and consequently not in the power of any other) to do it. Had Mr. Examiner obviated Vox Populi’s objections against the aforesaid article, he would have proceeded to have asked Mr. Examiner’s opinion with regard to the propriety or impropriety of nine states establishing a government on the ruins of the articles of confederation, which were made in Congress, and after nearly three years examination, were ratified and confirmed by every state; in which it is stipulated and agreed by each state with the whole, and by the whole with each state, that said articles of confederation “shall be inviolably observed by EVERY STATE, and the union shall be PERPETUAL, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a CONGRESS of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.”2 He would have asked Mr. Examiner, whether it is possible for any number of states less than the whole contracting number, to make any, the least alteration in said federal system, without being involved in the guilt of an open and avowed violation of a sacred federal constitution, a total want of publick faith and destitution of national honour? Whether a government founded expressly on the principles and idea of unanimity, can be dissolved or materially altered by any number of the contracting parties short of the whole? And whether if any thing of that nature is carried into effect by any of the contracting parties, it can be considered in any other point of light than that of a revolt (not to say rebellion) against the national Constitution? Monday morning. N. B. Is it not possible that the proposed Constitution may be adopted as a system of federal government according to the proposals of the Convention, and have only 706,359 people in favour of it, and 2,346,340 people against it, or in that proportion?"
Newspaper,No,Portius,,American Herald,,11/12/1787,"To the PEOPLE of MASSACHUSETTS. The time is fast approaching, when you are to decide on the most important question that ever fell to the lot of humanity to determine upon.—Time, which is on the wing, will speedily introduce the second Wednesday of January next, a day which will never be forgotten2—a day big with the fate of, perhaps the rights, properties and privileges of the citizens of this Commonwealth—a day, on the events of which, depends the interest, not only of each individual in this Commonwealth, but of their posterity to the latest generation.—And no doubt you will receive either the blessings or the curses of all your unborn posterity, according as you decide, either in favour or against the all important question then to be determined on. Of what importance then is it, that you previously examine the matter fully; that you duly consider the propriety of the part you then propose to take? You will undoubtedly take the advantages which will accrue to you as a people, by the adoption of the proposed Constitution, and put them in one scale, and the disadvantages you will put in the other, and as the preponderation of either scale appears, your conduct will be according. A subject of such vast magnitude should be taken up with all the cool, dispassionate deliberation the mind of man is capable of: Every thing therefore which has a tendency to raise the passions, or inflame the mind should studiously be avoided, both in our mental deliberations, and in our discourses with, and communications to, others; and wherever this is wanting, we run the greatest danger of forming a wrong determination within ourselves, as well as injuring those we have communication with, and we should do well to remember that it is ten to one if we make use of such means with others, but we shall injure that cause which we wish to support. As a free member of a free community, I have offered the foregoing observations to my fellow-citizens, and I pray the candid attention of the public to the following observations on the proposed Constitution, and only wish they may be considered with the same candour with which they are offered. I shall begin my observations with that which I conceive every Constitution should begin with, viz. a Bill of Rights; this we search for in vain in the proposed Federal System. When the proposed System came first to my hands, I made diligent search for that article, but searched to no purpose; why it was omitted [217]was a question of too delicate a nature for me to determine. Since which I have been informed that it was omitted for two reasons, the first of which was, “The Congress could exercise no powers, but what were expressly delegated to them, in the federal Constitution, which made a Bill of Rights wholly unnecessary.” However true this objection is, it will apply with equal force to any Constitution whatever; we will take for example the Constitution of this Commonwealth, where we shall find the powers by it vested in the General Court as particularly defined, as those with which Congress is proposed to be vested with, are in the federal Constitution,—yet it was deemed absolutely necessary, that our State Constitution should be prefaced with an unalterable Bill of Rights; and I could wish that my fellow-citizens would consider, before they give their decisive determination, whether they have any kind of reason to view a Bill of Rights less necessary now than seven years ago.—The other reason which has been alledged why a Bill of Rights was needless in the federal Constitution, is because “each State has a Bill of Rights of its own,” which would be a sufficient safe-guard and protection to its liberties. This at first blush appears to have a considerable degree of plausibility in it: But that plausibility, I think, will vanish if we attend seriously to the matter as precipitately as darkness from before the rays of the sun:—The Bill of Rights of this Commonwealth ‘tis true is a mound insurmountable by their own legislature, but it is no barricade against the operations of a Federal Government. Our Bill of Rights is a rule of conduct to no body but our own rulers and our own citizens, any more than the other parts of our Constitution, or the Acts of our Legislature are: How insignificant then is the last excuse for omitting a Bill of Rights in the Federal System of Government! The good people are therefore only desired to consider this simple question, Is a Bill of Rights necessary in a System of Government? Before we attempt to consider the articles of the proposed Constitution, it is needful that we consider one previous matter, which lies with peculiar weight on my mind, and which, if it is not obviated, can not fail of over-throwing the whole structure, and reduce it to the situation of a baseless fabrick of nocturnal reverees. It is this—Congress on the ninth day of July, A. D. 1778, entered into a Federal System of Government, contained in 13 articles of confederation; which articles were sent out to each State for their approbation or disallowance, after near three years deliberation, was approved and confirmed by every State, whereby it became a compleat System of Federal Government, and [218]as sacredly inviolable as any System of Government can be, and as binding on each State as any human Institution, Contract, Agreement, or Ordinance which can be invented.3 In the last and concluding article it is mutually agreed upon that said articles shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union shall be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislature of every State.4 Here the whole System of the United States are sacredly bound to adhere to the said articles of Confederation, until such time as they are altered in the manner aforesaid.—Here too each State individually are holden, sacredly holden to stand to, abide by, and defend said Continental System of Government until the same is altered by the joint consent and act of each State—Here we find too the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, by every tye of good faith, by every principle of compact, and by every idea of national honour, bound inviolably thereby, until Congress shall make alterations therein, and such alterations are ipso facto ratified by each and every State’s Legislature. Here is a System of Government as sacred as the nature of the thing will admit of, a National Compact, where each State stipulates with all the rest, and all the rest with each State, in the most solemn and unequivocal manner; and is it within the compass of human ideas to imagine that a System of Government so formed can be torn up by the roots, without the consent of the parties?—Will any say, that if the majority are in favour of such a measure, they may do it?—I answer no, by no means:—Where a Government is instituted upon the idea of a majority, there a majority have undoubtedly a right to make such an alteration as they think proper: But the case is widely different where a System of Government is formed on ideas of unanimity, and where it is expressly stipulated, that it shall receive no alterations but such as are unanimously agreed to. It is a maxim in law, founded on the eternal principles of reason and the fitness of things,—“That no act shall be revoked but with the same solemnity with which it was first enacted.” If that is the case, how can Nine States dissolve a System of Government, which Thirteen had instituted, and which the whole Thirteen pledged their faith to each other should not receive any alterations without the consent and approbation of the whole Thirteen?—This I must imagine will be found a question by no means of easy solution. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts have pledged their sacred honour to stand by and adhere to said Articles of Confederation until they are mutually altered by the joint consent of the Legislature of each [219]State. Keeping the last idea in view, let me propose the following interrogatory,—How can this Commonwealth give their approbation to a System of Government which impowers Nine States to erace the whole of that article from the Confederation?—Or, in another point of view, what right has this State either at their own instance, or at the recommendation of any body of men whatever, to break through the established Constitution of the United States, and openly set at defiance that System of Federal Government, for the support of which, they had pledged their most solemn engagements and sacred honour? Supposing Nine States should ratify and confirm the proposed Federal Government, and Four States should reject the same, Would not those Four States, still adhereing to the Articles of Confederation, have an undoubted right, both in the sight of God and man, to accuse the Nine approbating States with the most unequivocal breach of public faith, point-blank national infidelity, and I will add, of open REBELLION against the National Constitution!—And what confidence could they, or any foreign power ever place in those Nine States, thus confederated into a Government, the very basis of which is laid in the violation of public faith, and whose existence, as a State, sprang out of a revolt from their own established Government. These are considerations which I offer to the publick, for their serious, calm, deliberate and dispassionate consideration, previous to considering the Articles of the Constitution, now proposed for their approbation; and that they may be assisted in every stage of their deliberations by Him whose knowledge is infinite, and led to adopt such measures as he shall own and be pleased to bless, is the earnest and unfeigned prayer of PORTIUS. Boston, Nov. 3d."
Newspaper,No,Vox Populi,,Massachusetts Gazette,Examiner,11/13/1787,"Mr. Allen, In your paper of this day, I find a piece signed Examiner, in which the writer makes a number of remarks on a Card which I did myself the honour to hand him, through the medium of your paper, of last Tuesday.2 How far his observations falls short of obviating the difficulties proposed in [the] Card, is cheerfully submitted to the good sense of your readers, rather than undertake to be judge in that matter myself; but he will doubtless excuse me in making a few observations on his production, and lay them before the candid publick. He is pleased to call government’s originating from(a) jealousy and distrust, “A NEW IDEA;” but I shall challenge mr. Examiner to point out any other principle which could induce a rational person to make himself subject to civil government. If I was not jealous that some person would injure me in some way, what could I have to induce me to give up my natural liberty, and part with part of my natural rights? If I did not distrust the rectitude of my fellow-creatures’ future conduct towards me, what advantage could I ever expect to reap from a system of jurisprudence? Are not all the advantages which a person can expect to derive from entering into a state of civil government (or at least all he ought to expect) of a negative nature? Are they not all comprehended [223]in this one general idea, a prevention of injuries from others?—I think it is perfectly consistent with the most finished diffidence to answer in the affirmative. If that is the case, what kind of necessity, or even propriety, could there be in any person’s making himself a subject of a civil government if he was not jealous somebody would injure him? I next find him informing the world that I assert, “that no alteration can be made in the national government without the consent of all the states, because the confederation forbids it.” Out of regard to the gentleman’s nerves I shall forbear asking the Examiner to quote the passage, and shall content myself with proposing for his consideration this simple question—Is there no specifick difference between a quere and an assertion? Mr. Examiner then proceeds to evince the contrary, and his argument therefor is full as new as my idea of the origination of government was. It is needless to inform the publick, that, because the continental constitution has in some instances not been adhered to, therefore it ceases to be a crime to violate it—and implicitly charges all such as do not agree with him in this logical conclusion, with a desitution of common sense. If it would not be disagreeable to the Examiner’s feelings I would just mention, that this ratiocination of his, puts me in mind of a certain clergyman who in company (by way of joke) asked an Indian woman, who was present bottoming chairs—“How many commandments are there?” “NINE,” answered the old squaw. “Not but nine!” said the minister. “No, (rejoined the old native) there was ten, but you and me broke one to pieces ‘tother night, you know, so there is but nine left.” In order to set this matter in a just point of light, I will bring an instance, which will forcibly apply in this case. There is in this commonwealth a statute law against murder—Suppose that A. should, with malice prepense, kill B.—is taken up for the crime—is committed to prison—is indicted by the grand inquest—is brought to the bar—the jury impanelled—the indictment is read—the attorney-general arranges the evidence, which is plene proof—opens the matter to the jury—adduces the law—and sits down—The counsel for the prisoner arises—“May it please your honours, and you, gentlemen of the jury—I am for the prisoner at the bar, &c.—the fact of killing I do not deny, neither do I wish to conceal that it was done with malice prepense, but my ground of defence is very different—the law on which the indictment is founded, is obsolete, null and void; for it has been violated and broken more than one hundred times since it was enacted, and there remains no force or validity in it.” The figure which such a pleader would make at the bar, mr. Examiner, de facto, makes on the political and logical theatre! By the time mr. Examiner had got thro’ the whole concatination of his stupendous reasoning, his mental powers, by some means, forgot to execute their proper functions, so far as totally to mistake, not only my ideas, but my words, also; for he tells the publick, that my “last objection, that a small majority may choose the Congress,” &c. whereas there was not a syllable about choosing Congress in the whole card; ’tis true I proposed this quere to his consideration. “Is it not possible that the proposed constitution may be adopted as a system of federal government, according to the proposals of the convention, and have only 706,359 people in favour of it, and 2,346,340 against it, or in that proportion?[”] and I will now add, and have every person’s voice in the United States taken upon the matter? I proposed this question to set in a proper point of view the mode proposed by the convention for the acceptance of the constitution. I believe it is a maxim in politicks which will ever hold good, that no form of government ever ought to be accepted, unless a major part of the governed are in favour of it; and it is certain that no republican government ever can be established on any other principle; but according to the proposed plan, this federal system may be adopted by nine states, and the remaining four be unanimous against it; and at the same time these four dissenting states may be a considerable majority of the United States; and at the same time it is also possible that half the people in the approbating states, save nine, may be against it, which will leave a majority of about 22 against seven, disapprobating the constitution; and yet (amazing) the constitution be established as a plan of federal government! Is this consonant to the most remote principle of a republican government? While I am thus intruding on the indulgent patience of the publick, I beg they would forgive me in suggesting one thing to their minds, which I apprehend is closely connected with their welfare; I dare say they will indulge me. In the course of the late war, this commonwealth has involved itself deeply in a state debt, the discharging of which is inseparably joined with every, the smallest degree of the publick faith and honour—and we find, by woful experience, that an expectation of discharging it with the proceeds of a dry tax on polls and estates, is a baseless fabrick; and our only hope of ever discharging it, must be founded on a new system of taxation, viz. a suitable impost and excise, as well on imports as other superfluities and luxurious articles: is it not then expedient for the citizens of this state to pause a moment, and ask themselves the important question, does policy dictate that we should curtail ourselves of the right of taxing ourselves in the mode appearing most proper?—Must we be confined to a dry tax on polls and estates, when there is [225]many of us now taxed beyond our present power to pay? When it is no strange sight to see a person taxed more than his whole estate is worth? Must we give up the right of taxing ourselves except in a certain mode which has already sunk the landed interest, the last resort of our wealth, forty per cent, and which if persisted in will soon sink it ninety if not ninety-nine per cent.? I think every idea of policy, every principle of common sense, forbids a measure so pregnant with political perdition! I appeal to the good sense of all rational intelligences, whether or not that an individual, who conducted his private concerns upon as uneconomical a system as this, would not be put under guardianship as insane. Heavens! will the good sense of the eagle-eyed citizens of Massachusetts ever permit them to divest themselves of the power of adopting their own mode of taxation! Will it ever permit them to be nearly confined to a certain mode which their own woful experience in accents not less majestick than thunder, tells them is altogether impossible to be carried into effect, without bringing inevitable destruction and the most consumate distress on a great part—yea the greater part of the community? (The remainder next Friday.) (a) I make use of the word from, as that was the word in the Card, though mr. Examiner has thought proper to barter it away for the word in.—Perhaps he thought they were synonimous."
Newspaper,No,Hanno,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/13/1787,"To the Inhabitants of BOSTON. friends and brethren! As the zeal, which for some weeks past has actuated a number among us, to suppress all discussion upon the new plan of government, seems to be daily evaporating; give me leave to call your attention for a moment to your own interest. There is no doubt, but many of the more rigid supporters of the plan act honestly, however mistaken they may be in their principles, it becomes us all to deliberate. Neither all the friends to this plan, nor all the adversaries of it, are rogues, though some of each party may be benefited by having [226]their opinions adopted. This circumstance certainly ought not to induce to reject an opinion at once; for every publick benefit necessarily includes the benefit of a majority of individuals. That Philadelphia has an interest in supporting the new plan, which is separate and even opposite to the interest of this town, is pretty apparent. Can it be supposed that they have no desire to render that city the center of all the trade of the continent? And will they not be able to effect it, when the city shall be the residence of that power, which alone is to have the unlimitted controul of all the trade and the constitution of all the states on the continent. That city will derive additional advantages from being the center of all the continental revenues, while all our resources will be drained to supply them. On the other hand, this town is now the seat of sovereign power. Here we have an influence in legislation, by giving that commercial information to legislators whether they represent the seaports or the inland town[s], which enables them to adopt those regulations, that promote the industry of the former, and furnish the readiest vent for the produce of the latter. By this means the wealth and resources of the state every day increase. When the seat of power is removed, this town, which is now the resort of all nations, and which sends ships to every part of the habitable world, must bow her fair head to a successful rival, and mourn for departed glory. Perhaps the effects of sudden industry were never more apparent than they now are in every part of the commonwealth. By means of it, the trade of this town, particularly the export trade, is very considerably augmented, beyond what was ever known. Tho’ this may, from the increase of business, alone produce an occasional scarcity of cash, the evil will every day diminish by the returns of your voyages. If on the other side, through passion, or over-boiling zeal, we give the unlimitted right to regulate trade into other hands, these advantages will be forever lost, and the scarcity of money must continue as long as we exist. That commercial regulations, particularly a navigation-act, will be beneficial, is agreed on all hands: but great attention is necessary to perfect a system of trade and revenue, which shall operate equally on all parts of the empire. It is not my design at present to enter into the particulars of such a system. When any body, well skilled in trade and in legislation, shall propose such a plan, it will be very easy, by means of the General Court, to submit it to Congress, and to request from that august assembly, a recommendation of it to the states. This is a regular way to have our present confederation improved and perfected; and we never need to fear any disadvantages from protecting it. Adopt the proposed plan as [227]it stands, and we give up all the advantages of situation, resources, and activity, without the possibility of their return."

Letter,No,William Symmes Jr.,Peter Osgood Jr.,,,11/15/1787,"According to my promise I sit down to sketch out my reasons for objecting against ye. Federal Constitution. The essay will doubtless be imperfect; but I design it for your perusal only, & I can safely rely upon your goodness for all necessary allowances.— I will consider ye. objectionable passages in course as they occur in ye. System, as well for your convenience as my own. 1.—The apportionment of taxes. It appears to me that this will operate unequally against ye. northern States. Let us suppose that two fifths of ye. slaves in ye. five southern states amount at least to 150,000 persons. What reason can be given why, if taxes must be proportioned by population only, this should be rejected?—That ye. profits of their labour are nothing? I deny ye. fact; for I believe that every negro that cultivates ye. valuable staples, Tobacco, Wheat, Rice, Indigo, &c raises a greater profit to his master than any white can raise from his labour here.—What then?—That ye. southern Nabobs squander it all in Luxuries, & so ye. States there are made if anything, poorer?—Very good—The Convention then have [237]patronized Luxury, & taxed Industry & Oeconomy. [But?] three fifths include all ye. working slaves. Neither will this answer; for ye. northern States are taxed as much for an infant or a decrepid old man, as for a vigorous youth. How then shall we be taxed? I say not in proportion to actual wealth at present, but in proportion to a State’s advantages for acquiring wealth. The soil & climate of Virginia are better than those of this State—The staples of Virginia are in high demand—Its Rivers ye. finest in ye. world. How rich might Virginia be!—But Virginia is not rich—What then?—Shall a man need no better excuse from taxes than Idleness? He will hardly pay his private debts so easily.— Taxes must certainly grow out of ye. ground. What then is more evident than that ye. best land & ye. best produce (supposing ye. advantages of Commerce to be equal) should pay or (if you please, produce) ye. most?—And are not our long winters in which we consume ye. labours of ye. summer, to be considered? No—But yes, I beg pardon—they are considered—We pay ye. more.— But 2.—The Senate.— To what great purpose is it that we have an equal representation in ye. House, if we are represented by States in ye. Senate. This is a great grievance in ye. present Congress. That little Delaware should weigh as much in all political debates as this State, is, in a government merely popular, quite ridiculous.—Whose voice are we supposed to hear in all public transactions?—We accurate Republicans say, the voice of ye. people. Who are ye. people? We answer, ye. majority.—But a majority of States may chuse a President &c This is a close adherence to principles.—“Two Senators from each State, & each Senator to have a vote.” The present Congress mended & made worse, for now seven States with ye Vice president’s turning vote are competent when before it required ye. sanction of nine. But we shall have a proper House—All will be right there. True!—& that may be a good reason why we should not have a proper Senate—But I cannot see ye. force of it. Why any State should have more weight in one body than in ye. other, let ye. Convention say. And yet poor R. Island was not there to speak for herself.— I may speak of ye. duration of offices in another place.— 3.—Congress may make & alter ye. times places & manner of holding elections, except ye. place of chusing senators.— This is a very complaisant exception indeed—The Legislatures may sit where they please—It means this if it means anything—And we are doubtless much obliged to ye. Convention for this decent privelege.—But I presume ye. time of chusing senators must be in ye. winter, for it will be too hot for a session at ye. southward in ye. summer, and ye. [238]place of choosing Representatives may possibly be ye. county-town, or some place yet more remote. This would be very convenient.—But ye. word Manner! Oh it is an excellent word. It would not have been half so well to have tied ye. hands of this future Congress by saying all elections shall be made by ballot, or as ye. several States shall please. No—The States are to be made sensible how much this Congress is above them in all wisdom—even to ye. knowledge of a particular acre of ground. Nay, ye. Convention itself seems dazzled at ye. prospect of this wisdom—for they dared not prescribe it any rules. Now that ye. future Congress may be as wise as this Convention I have no great reason to doubt from anything that is past—But they will certainly have a great deal more power; & we shall shortly hear no more of recommendations. That they shd. make use of their power to enlarge ye. priveleges of ye. people let anybody expect that [will?].—Well then! If they do not enlarge them why make provision for altering them. That they may take them away? Oh no Never suspect such a thing.—What then shall we think of it? That ye. Convention were fools? Hardly—I see no other way but to recur to ye. great Wisdom of this future Congress—It will be a wise Congress—a very wise Congress—Here now is a way to get rid of every doubt.—But why need ye. Convention to care how ye. members are chosen, if they are but sent?—Oh, Sir—it will be a very wise Congress.—And about ye. place, if they are but chosen?—Oh Sir—a very wise Congress!—Just as good an answer as that of ye. Clown in All’s well that ends well, which was to everything Oh Lord, Sir! 4. The Houses to keep a journal & publish ye. same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secresy. Good again. A very wise Congress! The idea used to be, except private articles in foreign treaties, secret expeditions, &c—But this Constitution excels in ye. Laconic mode of speech. Or rather, perhaps ye. Convention were lazy & could not conveniently go about to particularize either ye. rights of ye. people, or ye. just prerogatives of Congress. Who can complain after this that he knows nothing of public affairs, except ye. expenditure of public monies? If Congress conceal, ye. Convention say it is best ye. people should not know—& indeed, if Congress are invested with all power, general knowledge might be inconvenient, as it could only produce discontents, & these might issue in rebellions.— When ye. dark pages of these journals shall be inspected by some young politician of future ages, who perchance may succeed his father in ye. national council—What lessons may he not learn!—There may he observe by what steps ye. form of a Govt. is imperceptibly changed—There [239]by what process ye. genius of a free people is altered—But I say no more.— 5. Congress shall have power, &c 1st. clause.— To lay—pretty well, when you read what & for what—but—and to collect—what?—taxes, duties, imposts, & excises—very well! for what ends?—to pay ye. debts, & provide for ye. common defence & general welfare of ye. United States.— A more general dedition or surrender of all ye. property in ye. United States to Congress could not perhaps have been framed. Gentlemen it is all—all yours to spend as you please, provided we may but know how you spend it—& even then you may sink as many thousands as you please under ye. heads of incidental charges, secret services, &c. Take it all. I will paraphrase the whole of this passage in a short address from ye. States to Congress.— Gentlemen, Having chosen you to govern us, and believing that thro’ all ages you will be a disinterested body, & will always spend money, if you can get it, with rigid economy, we give you full power to tax us—And lest we should some of us prove refractory in ye. matter of payment from some mistaken notions that you demand it too fast, we also give you full power to collect ye. taxes you lay in ye. way most agreable to yourselves, & we will pay all your collectors, deputies, & so forth, as you shall direct. And as you have power to contract debts for us to pay, you shall have all ye. money you want to pay them—And you shall have all you want to build forts, magazines, & arsenals; buy arms & ammunition; make war & peace, & so forth—And in short, whatever you shall think will be in any degree for our good you shall have money to do, & we will never trouble you with any enquiries into ye. motives of your conduct, always relying on your wisdom with ye. most implicit confidence, & submitting our estates entirely to your disposal. A very handsome donation! And when compared with ye. clause that throws all imposts & excises into ye. Continental treasury, produces a Query—How each state shall support its own Government?—By a dry tax, & one perhaps which cannot be collected, because ye. Federal Collectors must have ye. preference. So that we must expect to be sick of State Government as an expensive useless thing—& then Congress will help us to a Federal Intendant, perhaps, to save us the trouble of governing ourselves.—But this may be more than my text will justify.— 6.—To raise & support armies, &c,— That ye. Federal Head should have power to raise an army for some purposes is perhaps quite necessary—Whether it is so or not, ye. present Congress have such power. But here appears to be a fault by no [240]means singular in this constitution, viz, ye. want of limitation. All is left to ye. discretion of Congress, & there is no bar against a standing army in time of peace. For tho’ no appropriation of money to this use may be for a longer term than two years, yet this is long enough, when ye. same appropriation may be continued for two years to ye. end of time. And we are to expect that this Congress will soon have such a system of policy as will bind their successors, either by ye. force of its obvious expediency, or by ye. danger of innovation, to persist in ye. same plan.— 7. To exercise exclusive legislation, &c— I do not see so much of ye. terrible in this as some do, especially if ye. rest is granted. Congress will be secure from little mobs, & so it ought to be. It will be delivered from ye. persecution of ye. state in which it resides, & so it ought to be. It may build accommodations for a court which will be, as they ought to be, ye. property of ye. United States. And that a body so powerful, ought to be handsomely lodged, I believe every foreigner will imagine.—But how this clause came into ye. constitution I know not—for I believe any state might grant what is here demanded of ye. whole, to Congress, or any body corporate with ye. consent of Congress.— 8. No state shall emit bills of credit, or make tender-laws.— Here I suppose ye. principal weight of opposition will hang. The point itself is of consequence, but it will receive more from ye. prejudices of men, & our present embarrassed situation. You know my sentiments are directly opposed to paper money, as they would be in almost every case in which we could want it.—But ye. query is whether every state shall be in a worse situation than any individual, who, if he has not ye. cash in hand, may give his promissory note. I think it ought not to be, unless ye. United States will promise to lend us money whenever we want it. But I should agree to this, that no bills of credit shall ever be a tender. This regulation would be not only just, but conformable to my notions of sound policy.— As to other tender-laws, they are, in fact, but poor expedients—but they are expedients, & such as a State may possibly need. It is really better to have some kind of tender-law than to be thrown into confusion. And a State is so much a better judge of its own circumstances, that I had rather see this regulation in ye. State, than in ye. Federal Constitution. Yet, unless it were in all, some states might impose upon others, & so justice would not be equally, & universally done. I wish that ye. abolition of these abuses might be deferred till we are in a more prosperous situation—& had rather that Congress should even [241]have power to say hereafter when they shall cease, than that they should cease immediately upon ye. adoption of any new System.— I omit ye. next sentence, because I don’t at present understand what effect it will have on ye. private debt of each particular State.— 9. No State shall without ye. consent of Congress enter into any agreement or compact with any other State.— If I understand this, it is a curious passage. What! may we not even agree together—If there be a suit in ye. Federal Court between two States, may they not, like private parties, agree. Or in an hundred other cases of no Federal concern, may they not treat, & settle their disputes! I must have mistaken these wise men. It cannot be so. To accuse ye. Convention of folly would be gross—I dare say that most of them had rather be accused of design.— 10. The president may with ye. advice of two thirds of ye. senators present, make treaties—& with ye. consent of Senate Ambassadors, &c— The Senate—Who are ye. Senate? Look back, & you will see that a majority is a Quorum. This is fourteen, & two thirds of fourteen are eight ten. The President & ten Senators may make treaties. And ye. President & senate, i.e. by ye. same rule, eight senators may appoint Ambassadors, Ministers, Consuls, Judges, & almost everybody else.— Where, in God’s name, did they get this?—From reason, or from history? I fear not from ye. former, & as to ye. latter, it has not come within my reading in any Constitution where a Republican form is guarantied. Are we then a Commonwealth, & shall we have no voice in treaties, but by our President or elective King? In four years’ time (with good hope of another election) cannot he pack a sufficient Senate to enable him to gratify his favourites, or sell his country?—If this be not a servile adherence to ye. pattern of ye. King & Privy Council of Great Britain, I confess I know not what it is. Congress may declare war indeed, but ye. President may make peace upon what terms he shall think proper. Is a peace of less consequence to ye. nation than a war, or is it of more, that this power is given to one man? What is ye. privelege of declaring war, compared with ye. power of making all kinds of treaties? If he make a bad treaty, what then? Why he may be impeached, if anybody dares impeach him, before ye. very Senate that advised ye. measure. And if convicted, what? He shall be removed from his office, & perhaps disqualified to hold any other. And after this he may chance to lose his head by a trial at Law, if ye. Judges, whom he has appointed, will bid ye. Jury to convict him. And so, with a great deal of difficulty, for some (perhaps) irreparable detriment, we get ye. offender’s head.—Is there no better way than this?—But I must not dwell longer.— 11. The President shall take care that ye. laws be faithfully executed.— That there must be an executive power independent of ye. Legislative branch, appears to have been generally agreed by ye. fabricators of modern Constitutions. But I believe it has not till now been supposed essential that this power should be vested in a single person. The execution of ye. Laws requires as much prudence as any other department, & ye. pardoning or refusing to pardon offences is a very delicate matter. Yet he has no Council, no assistance, no restraint.— But was ever a commission so brief, so general, as this of our President? Can we exactly say how far a faithful execution of ye. Laws may extend—or what may be called, or comprehended in, a faithful execution? If ye. President be guilty of a Misdemeanor, will he not take care to have this excuse; & should it turn against him, may he not plead a mistake? Or is he bound to understand ye. Laws & their operation?—Should a Federal act happen to be as generally expressed as ye. President’s authority, must he not interpret ye. act? For in many cases he must execute laws independently of any judicial decision.—And should ye. Legislature direct ye. mode of executing ye. laws, or any particular law, is he obliged to comply, if he does not think it will amount to a faithful execution? For to suppose that ye. Legislature can make laws to affect ye. office of ye. President, is to destroy his independence, & in this case to supersede ye. very constitution.—Is there no instance in which he may reject ye. sense of ye. Legislature & establish his own? And so far would he not be to all intents & purposes absolute! Doubtless it is a very good thing to have wholesome laws faithfully executed.—But where this power is given to a single person, it does not seem to me that either sufficient instructions, or a sufficient restraint, can be couched in two words.— 12. The Judicial power, &c— “Shall extend to all cases between citizens of different States.” This seems an hardship on account of ye. appeal, which will carry many men 600 miles, & cause them more expence than ye. matter in dispute may be worth. There is no reason why citizens of different states should not have as good a remedy against each other as citizens of ye. same State, nor why a Debtor in ye. one case should pay more cost than a Debtor in ye. other. And supposing that to avoid cost ye. appeal in this case should be taken away (tho by this Constitution it cannot) yet this would be very unequal.—I think this part of ye. judicial power not only very grievous, but quite unnecessary; for disputes between inhabitants of different states have hitherto been very well determined in one of ye. states.—And now all remedy for small dues is taken away in effect—for [243]tho’ judgment be obtained in ye. Infr. Court, ye. Debtor by appealing may discourage ye. Creditor from any further pursuit.— 13. The Sup. Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law & fact, except &c— Except what?—Here they are at it again!—“With such exceptions, & under such regulations, as Congress shall make.” A very wise Congress!—This Convention have really saved themselves a great deal of labour by this presumption. I confess upon ye. principle that there cannot be a fair trial before Judges chosen by ye. State in which one of ye. parties resides, juries must also be excluded. But I deny the principle, as too great a refinement.—A Federal jury in ye. Sup. Court, but especially one from ye. vicinity would be a chimera, if ye. Court be stationary. But that ye. same men shou’d be Judges of Law & fact is against reason & not congenial to a free government. Congress may make as many exceptions as they please—But to talk of regulating men’s judgment of facts would be to talk nonsense.— 14. The United States shall guaranty to every State a Republican form of Govt.— Republics are either Aristocratical or Democratical; & the United States guaranty one of these forms to every State. But I disapprove of any guaranty in ye. matter. For though it is improbable that any State will choose to alter ye. form of its govt. yet it ought to be ye. privelege of every State to do as it will in this affair. If this regulation be admitted it will be found difficult to effect any important change in State-government. For then ye. other States will have nearly as much to do with our government as we ourselves. And what Congress may see in our present constitutions, or any future amendments, not strictly republican in their opinions, who can tell?—Besides, it is of no importance to any State how ye. govt. in any other is administered, whether by a single House, or by two & a King.—I therefore presume that as this clause meddles too much with ye. independence of ye. several States, so also it answers no valuable end to any, or to ye. whole— With regard to ye. Constitution taken into one view— It is a complete system of Federal Government, every part of which is full of energy; & if established, I think it can never fail of being obeyed by ye. people, and no combination can ever be sufficiently extensive or secret to subvert it. There is some ambiguity in several important parts of it, which arises principally from ye. too general terms in which it is expressed. Too much perhaps is left for ye. future Congress to supply, which when supplied will be no part of ye. Constitution. The States are strictly confined to their own business, & even these are [244]not a little circumscribed. And the powers of all ye. Federal departments are very ample & adequate to their ends.—In short, ye. system would make us formidable abroad, & keep us very peaceable at home; & with some amendments might do very well for us, if we could be contented to become citizens of America, confuse ye. thirteen stripes, & change ye. stars into one glorious Sun.— let us pause— It is not in a few light strictures—It is not, perhaps, in ye. most acute & methodical essay—that ye. merits of this unexpected—this wonderful system can be strictly defined. Reading cannot be applied, & experience is out of ye. question. Thus much we may easily perceive—it is a great, almost a total, & probably a final change. With regard to every state, “To be or not to be—that is ye. question.” So great a revolution was never before proposed to a people for their consent. In a time of profound peace, that a matter of such infinite concern should be submitted to general debate throughout such an empire as this, is a phenomenon entirely new.—Let us make a due return to that providence by which we enjoy ye. privelege, by using it like a wise, prudent, & free people. Let us equally shun a hasty acceptance or a precipitate rejection of this all-important scheme. And if our final decision be ye. effect of true wisdom, let us never doubt but that ye. end will be happy!— To close,— You must easily see, Sir, that what I have written is but a light sweep on ye. surface of things. Many things in ye. Constitution worthy of remark I have entirely omitted, those I have mentioned I have but slightly criticized, & what is not in ye. Constitution that ought to be there, I have not attempted to say. I found you had prescribed me a task which few men perhaps can adequately perform & that I had not by any means qualified myself to do it.—But, if this trifling attention to your wishes should prove a gratification, I shall be satisfied in that respect.—"

Newspaper,No,Vox Populi,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/13/1787,"On my Return to this place, I received your Favr of the 17th of Sepr & immediately sent the letter inclosed to Philadelphia.2 If the new constitution should be adopted, I shall think it my duty to support it, but as it now stands I think it neither consistent with the principles of the Revolution, or of the Constitutions of the several States, & it is condemned by the best Writers on free Governments, indeed the eastern States will soon rebel against it, for it is not a Government adapted to their Genius, Habits, or aversion to arbitrary power, but if they are of a different opinion, I have no objection to their trying on the fœderal Chains, for such I am persuaded they will find the bonds of this constitution eventually to be. this entrè nous— I could wish to stop here, and proceed no further, but I must renew my address to the publick’s indulgence for liberty to make another address to my fellow-citizens, which is for them to consider, how it comports with policy for them to establish a system of government entirely disconnected with a bill of rights’? I long sought for the reason why a bill of rights was omitted; at last I had the two following reasons assigned viz. first, as the powers proposed to be vested in Congress were definite no bill of rights was necessary, for they could exercise no power but what is expressly given them by the constitution. The other reason is, because each state has a bill of rights of its own, a federal bill of rights must be wholly useless. With regard to the first, it will apply with equal force to any constitution of government extant; we will take our own state’s for instance, where we shall find the powers vested in the General Court are as definite as those proposed to be vested in Congress; yet, when the constitution was formed, it was deemed absolutely necessary that the people should be protected by an explicit unequivocal bill of rights, and the publick are desired to consider whether that was a piece of ill-judged policy or not; and if it was not, whether the nature of things has so changed since as to render it needless. The second reason given why it was omitted, I think cannot have much greater force than the former; we may as well say, that because each state has a constitution of its own, that a continental constitution was unnecessary, as to say that because we have a state bill of rights a continental one is unnecessary. But let us consider what is our bill of rights, and what was its original design. If we consider its nature, we shall find it was constructed as a barricade to prevent our own General Court from infringing on certain rights which the people did not mean should be at the disposal of the legislature, and is simply a rule of conduct for our legislature. But what will Congress have to do with our bill of rights, any more than they will with the rest of our constitution? Will any person suppose that the other parts of our constitution will be any rule of their conduct? I should imagine if they do, it will curtail some part of the powers which it is meant, by the proposed constitution, they should exercise. The virtuous and enlightened citizens are requested to pay that attention to this matter which the importance of its nature demands, and act thereon the part which to them shall appear becoming free men, who have hazarded their lives and fortunes to establish a government founded on the principles of genuine civil liberty and undefiled republicanism. I cannot persuade myself to put an end to this piece without suggesting one thing more to my fellow-citizens—which is this, That whereas the proposed constitution, if it is adopted, will make material inroads in the present established constitution of this commonwealth, and rip up, and turn topsy-turvy, a considerable number of its constituent parts, it is highly deserving their consideration, whether such alterations can possibly, in the nature of things, be made in our constitution, in the method now proposed.2 In order to assist the good people in this consideration, let the following things be carefully attended to. The constitution of the commonwealth of Massachusetts was founded on the idea of two thirds of the inhabitants approving of the same, and [253]accepting it as a system of government; and if any number short of two thirds accepted it, it was to be null and void. Accordingly, it was laid before the several towns for the people’s approbation or rejectment; and the number of votes, pro and con. from the several respective towns, were taken and returned to the convention, who were appointed to do that business; and on a strict examination it was found to be ratified, accepted and recognized by two thirds of the people in the state, in all its parts, as a constitution and frame of government for this commonwealth, and was accordingly declared to be such.—And can it possibly be a serious question in the mind of any man, whether any body of men, whatever can legally or constitutionally dissolve said constitution, or any part thereof, except it is done with the same solemnity, and with as high a power, as it was made by? or, in other words, whether any number of our citizens, less than two thirds, can, consistent with any system of constitutional principles, dissolve or alter the same, or any part thereof? I must imagine that such a question exists in the mind of no rational man; for it is a maxim founded in the nature of things, that a thing cannot be unmade but by the same power that created it; and ’tis also an axiom in all systems of jurisprudence, that no obligation, deed, agreement, contract or engagement, can be dissolved or altered but by an instrument of as high a nature as that which constitutes it; and no act, ordinance or decree, can be reversed but by the same authority that enacted, made or determined it. And we may add to these universally uncontroverted principles of civil policy, the express provision made in our constitution for its revision, where expressly the consent of two thirds is made necessary to such an event. Let us examine for one moment, whether the proposed plan of amendment (for such in the present instance it is proper to call it) involves in its nature any thing which is correspondent with the aforesaid principles of civil policy. This commonwealth contains about 340 towns, each town will undoubtedly send a delegate to the convention, who will there act the sentiments of a major part of his constituents, and the majority of the convention will decide on the matter, and their decision may be only a bare majority of a bare majority: so that the proposed constitution, essentially altering our state constitution, may be established in this state by a minority of five against a majority of fourteen, which has every feature of that worst of all governments, ARISTOCRACY. Paying an impartial attention to the foregoing observations, I freely submit it to the candid publick, whether a ratification of the proposed federal constitution is not wholly incompatible with that allegiance which [254]is due from each of our citizens to the commonwealth and the constitution thereof; more especially I would recommend it to the serious consideration of all in office under government, as well as all who have been since the inauguration of our present constitution, how they can reconcile their approbating the proposed constitution, with that SOLEMN and UNEQUIVOCAL DECLARATION and OATH, which they, in the presence of God, made at their entering into office, and which is registered in Heaven, and still binding on them!3 Let the publick reflect but a moment on the immense expense of treasure, toil, fatigue, hardship and danger, as well as blood, with which we last winter defended our invaluable constitution, and consider whether they will now reduce it to a mere skeleton! Let them further consider, that provided the alterations are made in our state constitution, which must be made in it if the proposed federal one is adopted, and if this is done only by a bare majority of a bare majority, I say let them consider in what respect such a revolution would differ from the bold and unprovoked one which was attempted to be made last winter!4 But perhaps it may be asked, “if the proposals of the convention are so pregnant with mischief, how came the General Court to lay them before the publick?” I answer, the General Court acted merely officially in laying them before their constituents, according to the direction of Congress, the supreme council of the nation; and had the General Court withheld them from the community (whose servants they are) it would have been chargeable with arogating to itself the power of deciding on a question which only fell within the province of the people at large to determine upon, so that the General Court acted with the greatest propriety as well as constitutionality on the matter.

Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,11/19/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Place the Frame of Government proposed, in the most favorable point of view, magnify the priviledges held forth to the people to their fullest extent, and enlarge as much as you please, upon the great checks therein provided, notwithstanding all which, there cannot remain a doubt in the mind of any reflecting man, that it is a System purely Aristocratical, calculated to find employment for men of ambition, and to furnish means of sporting with the sacred principles of human nature. The great object throughout, is the acquisition of property and power, and every possible opportunity has been embraced to make ample provision for supplying a redundancy of the one, to exercise the other in its fullest extent. They have engrossed to themselves the riches of America, and are carefully silent what use they intend to put them to. Powers are there granted, that shall give to persons, greater strangers, and perhaps greater enemies to you than the people of Great-Britain, the right of entry into your habitations without your consent, not a lisp being mentioned as to the mode or time when such powers shall be exercised. They have taken to themselves the Purse and Sword of your country. Like the performance of a fine painter, the Senate is the subject of the piece painted.—The people with their priviledges, to an attentive observer, may be seen in the back ground, composing an insignificant part of the drapery, but their existence depends upon the freshness of the colours.—Frequent handling, a little exposure, and the smallest inroads of time upon these shades, will soon destroy them, and they will no longer be considered a part of the composition. If this is true—if in any future period, however distant, we are to be governed by One Branch, it surely behoves us to provide for an equal voice in that Branch, that our respective influence shall bear some small proportion to our respective contributions and numbers: Whereas in this System, equality is totally disregarded. Five pounds in the Senate has an equal voice with fifty, and about five hundred thousand of the inhabitants the same number of votes with the remaining three millions. Where then is the probability the rights of the people will find equal security? Is it not demonstrable that your burthens will be great in proportion as your influence in that body that imposes them is small? As it respects this Commonwealth, infinitely better would be our situation in a representation in the British Parliament. The terms offered us by our enemies [266]to place us as we stood in 1763, bear no comparison in their consequences, to those which would flow from the exercise of the powers of this Government by the Senate, as now constructed. If the same proportion in numbers and property had been observed in this Branch as in the House of Representatives (and no reason why it was not hath yet appeared, excepting what the celebrated Southern gentleman is pleased to term a “necessary compromise between contending interests[”])2 however successful they might be hereafter in arrogating all the powers of government to themselves, or however severe in executing them, still one gleam of hope with the spirit of consolation would be found in the breast of the subject, that his grievances were proportionate to those of his neighbours; but in the present case, even this satisfaction is denied him—the uncertainty is not left him—his reason instanter convinces him it is not so. It is idle to expect more virtue in an American than in an individual of any other nation.—That in opposition to all other countries, we are disposed in this, to live peaceably with each other, to consult our neighbours interest equally with our own, and to do to others as we should wish they should do to us. This being the case, we should not want any government.—Human nature is the same in all parts of the world, bad is the best: Education and example may tend to check or promote good or bad qualities, and encourage different degrees of vice. Some passions are more encreased by exercise in some countries than in others; but in all, the original stock is the same. We see in America the same vices, as abroad, and we are not backward in the practice of both wit and ingenuity in cultivating them. The pleasure of controul is palatable to all mankind without a single exception from the cradle to the throne. Let our peculiar situations be what they may, our proportion of happiness great, our domestic circles pleasing, our love of money unbounded, without a moment of suspence, still we are ready to risque the sacrifice of them all for a share in the exercise of power over our fellow creatures,—for the sake of governing others, instead of being governed ourselves; and the more we examine the conduct of those men who have been intrusted with the administration of governments, the more assured we shall be in our position, that mankind have perhaps in every instance abused the authority vested in them, or attempted the abuse of it. In considering the present Government before us, we therefore certainly ought to look upon those who are to put it in motion, as our enemies—to be careful what we give—to see what use it is to be put to—and where to resort for a remedy, if it is abused.—Every door unguardedly left open, they will take care we never shall hereafter shut—every link in the chain unrevitted, they will [267]provide shall always remain so.—It is of the last importance we set out right, we never can return to our present situation so well prepared to set out again. This institution once established will not wear wholly out for thousands of years.—It will not be easy for any single State to alter it by force of arms.—To guard against such attempts, will claim the earliest attention of our new Governours. To you, my fellow-citizens, let me now appeal: To you, who do not expect immediately to taste the sweets that flow from unlimited power, who determine upon principles that are immutable, who are not warped by private interest, and do not see through different mediums on different days—is there any among you who have had leisure to examine this Frame of Government, and without taking into consideration the powers granted therein, can say he approves of it—that he is pleased with the organization of the different branches, in their balances and their checks, that the people are fully and adequately represented, and let Human Nature be as depraved as Hell itself, (and we all know it is) yet the means provided to keep it within bounds are ample for the purposes?—I trust there is not one so passively disposed.—Indeed there cannot be, for it is grossly deficient in all these properties, it fails in a balance, and in a due seperation of the different departments—it totally fails in a fair, faithful, honest image of the people, and in an equality of representation, in the only powerful branch in it.—I feel a confidence that the good sense of the people of this Commonwealth, will secure a proper decision upon so important a subject. I feel animated, when I reflect, in what precious estimation they have held their liberties, from the settlement of their country to the present hour—with what ardour they have encountered distress, poverty and death, to preserve and secure them, and with what caution they have parted with even that proportion, which is necessary for the assistance of good order and society.—I go on further to contend, that though its frame was the best ever proposed to a people for their acceptance, and would last properly balanced for ages, yet powers are there given, more than are either fit or necessary in any case to be parted with.3 The extent of our country, with all its striking features, while they conspire to promote a federal union, are totally inconsistant with the plan of one Universal Empire, involving in it the destruction of the different State Governments.—I appeal to the most flaming zealots for the new Constitution, whether one of them, until the disclosure of the proceedings, entertained an idea, that the Convention would assume the power of internal taxation.—I dare affirm it was not lisped by an [268]individual, throughout the whole Continent. Among all the conversations respecting the sending of members to that Convention; even the claim over the excises was not started.—It was on the contrary, a point universally conceded, that had the impost been vested in Congress by the States at the time proposed, with powers to collect it, there never would have been an occasion for a Convention.4 That federal measures would have taken a favourable turn, and with the proceeds of that revenue, Congress would have been able to have supported her own household, paid the interest of her domestic debt, and the different instalments, and interest of her foreign. But now these same Gentlemen, despising every civil institution yet adopted in America, and finding the form of Government far more grateful to their ambitious spirits than they ever imagined, will tell you, that the existance of the Continent depends upon its adoption—that we are ruined and undone, if we do not cordially embrace it, but if we do, like the ingenious dentist, it will pull from the breast of every citizen, all his jarring, malevolent passions, making us a wise, virtuous and wealthy people, and though they do not in plain words say that the millennium is to commence on its birth day; yet they describe to you, all the blessed effects expectant upon such an era. A dry tax is at all times odious. It is not congenial to the feelings of a free people. It is a visible demand upon a man at noon day, of that which he prefers to his life. He is called upon, when the necessity of giving it to support the society he lives in, does not strike him so forceably;—he for ever parts with it with reluctance, and would never consent, but under a conviction, that it is absolutely necessary—that it is his proportion—that it will be properly applied, and is laid upon him by his neighbour, chosen by himself, whom he controuls, and who bears an equal share of the same burthen.—It is a science difficult in its nature, duly to assess it. A man must not only be knowing to the different circumstances of every individual, the value of his real and personal estate—but also must be without passions, without prejudices, without connections, making it his whole business. This not being the case, produces heart burnings, evasions, false oaths, unequal assessments, delays of payment, and finally, inability. These inconveniences are still increased by the mode of collecting the tax when so assessed. This trust is placed, in general, in persons who have neither knowledge or discretion equal to the importance of it. An opportunity is put into their hands to gratify all their little prejudices and resentments. They will unreasonably press upon one, and at the same moment indulge another. Unused to handle large sums of money, they cannot help fingering untill they think it their own—They misapply first a small proportion, one extravagance leads to another, until they are in arrears [269]when called upon—and the honest and industrious are obliged again to contribute to supply their deficiencies.—This is the operation of a dry tax in its best situation; and it serves to demonstrate, that taxation and representation are inseperable—that they never can be laid upon the subject but by himself, or his representative, not treble refined, but resident in his vicinity, who shall be conversant both in his ability as to quantum, and propriety as to time. Even then they ought not be resorted to, but in the last extremity, for surely this Commonwealth will not be backward to testify, that notwithstanding they have made the experiment under the most promising circumstances, still woeful experience demonstrates the utter impossibility of raising and collecting monies sufficient for the use of government in such an odious, unequal manner. The five taxes past, in their consequences, have introduced idleness, dissipation, fraud, discontent, bankruptcies, unlawful speculations, stock-jobbing, and every other vice incident to our species, without supplying the Treasury with scarce a farthing. Government have always demonstrated a disposition to ease the people in the payment as much as in their power, notwithstanding which no one single person is satisfied, Government itself almost destroyed in consequence, and the end proposed in no one shape answered. If then, my fellow citizens, it is so easily demonstrated that dry taxes are attended with such fatal consequences, when we impose them ourselves, that the evils accompanying the collection of them in the best given circumstances, overbalance all the advantages accruing from the monies raised by such collections.—What reason have you to suppose that a Continental tax will be more beneficial in its consequences, more equal in its assessments, and milder in its mode of collection. A man must be distracted to suppose so, for there are no avenues open for either of those consequences to flow through. In the first instance, the sum will be laid upon you by people that cannot be sufficiently acquainted with your country. A new set of Continental pensioned Assessors will be introduced into your towns, whose interest will be distinct from yours.—They will be joined by another set of Continental Collectors, still less principled and less adequate than the former. Attempts will be made by interested men upon their integrity, and instances of their deviations will be daily before your eyes.—At a distance from their employers and removed from the Seat of Government, you will see them exulting with ideas, that they can practice their oppression upon you with impunity, and in their rioting and debauchery they will squander the proceeds of your industry.—The extremes of tyranny are commonly at the extreme parts of the country governed. You must kiss the rod, or they will make you feel it.—According to the spirit of obedience which you [270]manifest; to the ease with which you part with your money, so will the mode of assessing and collecting it be varied from time to time by your new masters. If one man shall not be competent, he shall be attended with an host.—Whether that host shall be the posse of your country or a file of armed soldiers, shall depend upon circumstances. They are to determine, and you are to make no laws inconsistent with such determination, whether such Collectors shall carry with them any paper, purporting their commission, or not—whether it shall be a general warrant, or a special one—whether written or printed—whether any of your goods, or your persons shall be exempt from distress, and in what manner either you or your property is to be treated when taken in consequence of such warrants. They will have the liberty of entering your houses by night as well as by day for such purposes.—All these points are given in letter and in spirit to the New Constitution, and the subject has not a shadow of security that they will not be executed.—Nay, if they ever should mean to exercise the right of taxation at all, I affirm it can be done with success by them in no other way, but in an arbitrary manner, and by previously subduing the spirit and strength of this Commonwealth. In forming our own Constitution, by persons having one common interest, we deemed it of consequence, to preface such powers, with the mode in which they should be exercised.—We thought it highly proper to declare “That every subject had a right to be secured from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions—that all warrants were contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation, and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, be not accompanied with a special designation,”5 &c. &c. &c.—These checks are omitted, however, in the present proceedings, and the sole reason why appears to be this, that the makers of them know the power itself to be improper, that the people would always be convinced of that impropriety, and would never submit, so long as they could resist.—That of course it must be collected without these checks, or not collected at all. These are serious thoughts.—They may by some be called bugbears; but they will be verified in the future history of America, with a vengeance.—That it will be in five, ten or fifteen years is not probable. Your rulers will be too knowing, to be over hasty in a display of their strength; they will not loose ground so easily as the Court of Great-Britain did for want of a little well timed policy.—Your chains will be gradual, and gilded. But finally they will be as visible as the Summer’s Sun in the Meridian. Where is the Government under Heaven, where [271]every farthing is not taken from the people, that they possibly can part with.—It must be the case here. Their interest will point out to them the policy in accustoming you to contributions, and their curiosity will be early excited to make the experiment to constitute a thermometer for your feelings.—They will have a plausible pretext.—They will tell you your burthens will be less when you get out of debt, and that they are the effect of not adopting it sooner.—They have large demands upon them, and matters of moment to undertake. The officers of their Government will be encreased an hundred fold, and the liberality with which they have expended their money in salaries plainly evinces the improbability that there ever will be a great sum lying idle in their treasury. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,11/19/1787,"A Correspondent begs leave to congratulate the Creditors of this Commonwealth, on the happy prospect there is of the adoption of the proposed Federal Constitution, and the benign consequences which must result from such an auspicious Event, for thereby this Government will be reduced to a mere Corporation; and the proposed Constitution makes provision for a Federal Supreme Judicial Court, at which they may originate what suits they please against the Commonwealth for those sums which it has injuriously neglected to pay them. They are requested to anticipate the pleasing satisfaction of seeing said Court under the sanction of a Federal Law, issuing its writs of execution against this Commonwealth, to be tried (under the protection of an army, if necessary) on any real or personal estate any where in the Commonwealth, and sold at publick auction for solid coin, and which they shall receive without any discount! How unlike this, is the present and late distressed situation of our public Creditors, when they were glad to realize one third part of the nominal sum! Let time add speed to her wings, and bring quickly the orient beams of this Federal Luminary into our Hemisphere, which cannot fail of introducing us into our wished-for melenium state."
Newspaper,No,A.B.,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/20/1787,"Mr. Allen, Before the people adopt the new plan of government, they will do well to read and consider the 8th chap, of 1st Samuel, which you will please to insert in your very useful paper. Your correspondent, A. B. 1st Samuel, chap. viii. And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. Now the name of his first-born was Joel, and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba. And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all they shall say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. According to all the works which they have done, since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods; so do they also unto thee. Now, therefore, hearken unto their voice: howbeit, yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you; He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take your maid servants, and your men-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day, because of our king which ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day. Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us, That we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city."
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/20/1787,"The following is a list of the members who withdrew from the late continental convention, previous to the signing of the proposed constitution, viz. Gerry, Strong, Massachusetts—Ellsworth, Connecticut—Yates, Yancey [Lansing], New-York—Martin, Maryland—Randolph, Mason, Virginia.1 A correspondent observes, that, in his opinion, it would tend more to the honour of a certain gentleman, who slily crept into office, if he would keep his b-ys at home, for the purpose of tilling his farm, instead of employing them to diffuse his anti-federal sentiments, far and wide.2 Our correspondent further remarks, that the base, groveling opponents in Massachusetts, to the new federal Constitution, had better be silent, if they cannot digest, through their thick pates, arguments of their own, in opposition to the new plan of government, as it looks rather sneaking, on their part, to be obliged to resort to publications which originated elsewhere, and whose authors, some of them at least, are notoriously infamous characters.3 It is a malancholy reflection that our excellent constitution should be continually exposed to conspiracy. Shays and his party attacked it last winter by open force, while another set of men, in and about the capital, were endeavouring to destroy it in a different manner, and from as detestable principles; and the arbitrary, unconstitutional laws of the old legislature endangered it—but its superiour merits has supported it hitherto against their reiterated attacks. What effect the federal convention will have upon it, yet remains to be determined.4 It is a fact, says a correspondent, no less true than surprizing, that no person has attempted to answer the hon. mr. Gerry’s objections to the new plan of government, except mr. Wilson, the futility of whose arguments has been sufficiently exposed by writers, signed the Centinel, Cincinnatus, &c. which have appeared in the southern papers.5"
Newspaper,No,,,Essex Journal,,11/21/1787,"Mr. Printer, Being in your town the other day, I found a number of people huddled together at a public corner, attending to one who, from the loudness of his voice, appeared to be zealously affected with his subject.—I drew near, and found he was entertaining his audience with what he sometimes called tricks, sometimes defects, and at other times faults, in the Constitution now before the public, for their consideration—Tricks—defects—faults, exclaimed I! hanging down my head. A form of government framed by a Washington, a Franklin, &c. &c. to which they themselves, and their dearest connections are to be subjected, replete with tricks, defects, faults! These thoughts suddenly drew me into the following apostrophe.—O! Washington, why didst thou not practise thy tricks upon us when it was, year after year in thy power, and when thou couldst easily have availed thyself of all the Gold and Honours a British Monarch could bestow?—Or, if thou wouldst not sell thy country into the hands of foreigners (is it not better to Rule than to Serve in slavery)—couldst thou not have taken it to thyself, and have distributed thy favours among thy trusty bands, who waited but the nod of Washington, to crown thee with Regal powers? And who but must have bowed the knee and cried God save the King?—Strange infatuation! After refusing every thing “the world calls good or Great,” art thou now found leagued with the enemies of thy country, to destroy those sacred liberties which cost thee so dear? And art thou—Here my sentence was broken off and the current of my thoughts turned, by one, who, pulling me by the sleeve, whispered me, that our sagacious developer of Tricks—Defects—Faults, in the proposed Constitution, was amazingly involved in Debt!2 The world is naturally averse To all the Truth it sees or hears; But swallows nonsense and a lie, With greediness and gluttony. Hudibras."
Letter,No,Thomas B. Wait,George Thatcher,,,11/22/1787,"My dear friend—12 oClock—midnight.— Your Letter of the 12th receiv’d yesterday—Agreeably to your request I have enclos’d the Cumberland Gazettes.—You will observe I have commenced hostilities against the proposed National Constitution—not because I condemn it “by the lump”—but only in part.—Perhaps most of the evils I see, or think I see, might be remedied by a Bill of Rights.—Now do not answer this as your Brother Wilson did the seceding members of Pensylvania2—some of his observations were very good—and some, in my opinion, were very good for nothing.— You will tell me, perhaps, that the rights of each individual are secured in the Bill prefixed to the several state Constitutions—so they are:—But this is not what I am contending for—it is the right of sovereignty in the States (or so much of sovereignty as shall be thought best for them to retain) that I am anxious to preserve:—this will secure them from the encroachments of Almighty President and Congress.— I consider the several states to stand in the same a similar relation to the Nation, and its Constitution—as do individuals to a state and its Constitution—the former, have certain rights, as well as the latter, that ought to be secured to them—Otherwise State sovereignty will be but a name—the whole will be “melted down” into one nation; and then God have mercy on us—our liberties are lost.—The vast Continent of America cannot be long subject to a Democracy, if consolidated into one Government—you might as well attempt to rule Hell by Prayer. Mr. Adams makes mention of a Republic of but thirty miles square, that on account of a difference of [interests to preserve?] its liberties, was obliged to divide itself into two sovereign and independent States;—He also mentions another of but seventeen miles square, that, for the same reasons, was obliged to divide itself in the same manner.3—Now, allow this to be true, and then paint to yourself the precious figure that America, with its millions of square miles, would make under a democracy—But let us not trouble ourselves on this head—for, should state sovereignty disappear, my word for it, there is no danger of a Democracy—no, no—King George, and the Convention over which he lately presided, has prepar’d something quite as different from this, as one could have wished for, or reasonably expected— For God’s sake write—I wish to have your opinion of the new Constitution—of New York—of Congress, and of the great men of which it is composed.—Your friend forever [P.S.] Promote me, if possible, from Printer to Post Rider."
Newspaper,No,,,Cumberland Gazette,,11/22/1787,"By Art. I. Sect. 5. of the proposed National Constitution, a majority of either house shall constitute a quorum to do business;—and by Art. II. Sect. 2. the President, with two thirds of the Senators present, shall have power to make treaties, appoint ambassadors, &c.—Thus, eleven1 fine gentlemen may, by this constitution, cede (or sell) a part or the whole of a State, or indeed one half of the United States, to any foreign power, prince or potentate—And, says the constitution further, when this advantageous piece of business is finished, it shall become the supreme law of the land. Where is the mighty advantage of sitting under a government of three branches, if the subject may be disposed of, or sold, bag and baggage, to the highest bidder, by a twig of one of those branches?"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/23/1787,"TO THE PEOPLE. Many inconveniencies and difficulties in the new plan of government have been mentioned by different writers on that subject. Mr. Gerry has given the publick his objections against it, with a manly freedom. The seceding members from the Pennsylvania Assembly also published theirs.2 Various anonymous writers have mentioned reasons of great weight. Among the many objections have been stated the unlimited right of taxation—a standing army—an inadequate representation of the people—a right to destroy the constitution of the separate states, and all the barriers that have been set up in defence of liberty—the right to try causes between private persons in many cases without a jury; without trying in the vicinity of either party; and without any limitation of the value which is to be tried. To none of these or any other objections has any answer been given, but such as have acknowledged the truth of the objection while they insulted the objector. This conduct has much the appearance of trying to force a general sentiment upon the people. The idea of promoting the happiness of the people by opposing all their habits of business and by subverting the laws to which they are habituated, appears to me to be at least a mistaken proceeding. If to this we add the limitations of trade, restraints on its freedom, and the alteration of its course, and transfer of the market, all under the pretence of regulation for federal purposes, we shall not find any additional reason to be pleased with the plan. It is now conceded on all sides that the laws relating to civil causes were never better executed than at present. It is confessed by a warm federalist in answer to mr. Gerry’s sensible letter, that the courts are so arranged at present that no inconvenience is found, and that if the new plan takes place great difficulties may arise.3 With this confession [305]before him, can any reasonable man doubt whether he shall exchange a system, found by experience to be convenient, for one that is in many respects inconvenient, and dangerous? The expense of the new plan is terrifying, if there was no other objection. But they are multiplied. Let us consider that of the representation. There is to be one representative for every thirty thousand people. Boston would nearly send one, but with regard to another there is hardly a county in the state which would have one. The representatives are to be chosen for two years. In this space, when it is considered that their residence is from two hundred to five miles from their constituents, it is difficult to suppose that they will retain any great affection for the welfare of the people. They will have an army to support them, and may bid defiance to the clamours of their subjects. Should the people cry aloud the representative may avail himself of the right to alter the time of election and postpone it for another year. In truth, the question before the people is, whether they will have a limited government or an absolute one? It is a fact justified by the experience of all mankind from the earliest antiquity down to the present time, that freedom is necessary to industry. We accordingly find that in absolute governments, the people, be the climate what it may, are [in] general lazy, cowardly, turbulent, and vicious to an extreme. On the other hand, in free countries are found in general, activity, industry, arts, courage, generosity, and all the manly virtues. Can there be any doubt which to choose? He that hesitates must be base indeed. A favourite objection against a free government is drawn from the irregularities of the Greek and Roman republicks. But it is to be considered that war was the employment which they considered as most becoming freemen. Agriculture, arts, and most domestick employment were committed chiefly to slaves. But Carthage, the great commercial republick of antiquity, though resembling Rome in the form of its government, and her rival for power, retained her freedom longer than Rome, and was never disturbed by sedition during the long period of her duration. This is a striking proof that the fault of the Greek and Roman republicks was not owing to the form of their government; and that the spirit of commerce is the great bond of union among citizens. This furnishes employment for their activity, supplies their mutual wants, defends the rights of property, and producing reciprocal dependencies, renders the whole system harmonious and energetick. Our great object therefore ought to be to encourage this spirit. If we examine the present state of the world we shall find that most of the [306]business is done in the freest states, and that industry decreases in proportion to the rigour of government."
Letter,No,,,The New York Journal,,11/23/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, Please to insert the following Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman in Massachusetts to his Friend—and you will oblige A Customer. My dear Brother, I have perused the constitution with as much attention as I am capable of. I have read the pieces that have been written for, and against it.—The first appear to be founded in general observations and declamations; many of the last take up the constitution fairly, and the observations and arguments have not been answered—nor have there been any attempts to answer some of the most important of them. I did not at first comprehend all that is contained in the plan proposed. It is extremely well calculated not to make unfavorable impressions at the first reading. Many have acknowledged to me, that on the first perusal it pleased them—but that the more they consider upon it, the less they liked it. The three important powers to be conveyed by the people to the legislature, by this constitution, are, First. To make laws affecting the life, liberty, and property of the citizens of the United States, in every possible case. Secondly. To abolish the trial by jury in all cases. Thirdly. To alter the constitution itself, so far as amendments will ever be necessary. The two first have been amply discussed in the public papers. It has been established, incontrovertibly, that the plan contains these two powers The first, is founded as follows, Art. 1. sec. 8. paragraph 18. “To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution [294]the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof.” The primary objects of the constitution are expressed, “to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” The legislature will alone be the judges of what laws will be necessary and proper, relative to these indefinite objects. The next is the second paragraph of the sixth article. “This constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges, in every state, shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitutions, or laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding.” The legislatures of the states have annexed very different penalties to the crime of forgery. But when Congress, or the proposed legislature, annex a penalty to this crime, without limiting the extent of the operation of the act to citizens of different states, or to forging the public securities, or other papers of the United States, as they may do, it will then be the supreme law of the land. I do not see, but Congress must make laws for all the variety of cases that can possibly happen; and then will the municipal laws of the different states be wholly annihilated, by the supreme law of the land. With respect to the second article—It is founded upon the 3d article, 2d sec. and 1st paragraph. “The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, &c.” And second paragraph—“In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.” As the supreme court are expressly vested with jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in cases of appeal, and are only vested with original jurisdiction, in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and states; it seems, that in these last cases, the supreme court are not judges of the fact. A power expressly given in certain cases, strongly implies that it is not given, and is not to be exercised in any other case. This distinction was not attended to until writing down the last paragraph. I am willing to give it all the weight it is entitled to. I do not recollect that the idea contained in the third proposition has yet made its appearance in public:—It however appears, to me, to [295]be an important one, and worthy of critical examination. My reasons for this opinion, are contained in the primary objects, for which the constitution is to be made—which are, to insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.—In the 1st art. sec. 8, paragraph 18, already quoted, and in the 5th art.—“The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a Convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one, or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress. Provided, that no amendments, which may be made prior to the year 1808, shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clause in the 9th sec. of the 1st art. And that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate.” There is no stipulation in this article, that no amendments shall be made to the constitution, but by the legislatures of three fourths of the states, or of conventions, as the case may be. It is not stipulated that Congress shall, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the states, call a convention for proposing amendments. The plain language of this article is this, if two thirds of both houses deem the proposing amendments necessary; not if they deem amendments necessary, they shall propose them. The word “propose” holds a very important station in this article, and if it is intended that the states alone shall amend the constitution, it ought to be removed to the other side of the word “amendments.” If, therefore, Congress shall think amendments necessary to be made, they will make them, and they will not think it necessary to propose them to any body of men whatever. It appears, to me, that the people, if they adopt this constitution, will convey all the power they possess to the government of the United States.—They will therefore want no amendment in this respect; for if there should be any on this ground, to a diminution of power. It must, therefore, be evident now, that no alterations can be made, or proposed, but such as will relate to the president, senate, and house of representatives. It is not provided expressly, that there shall be a president and vice president chosen every four years; that the senate shall be chosen every six years, and that the members of the house of representatives shall be chosen every two years. If therefore Congress should deem it necessary to insure domestic tranquility, and to promote [296]the general welfare to make the president and senate hereditary in their offices, and to make the time and service of the members of the house seven years instead of two; it appears, to me, the constitution gives them a legal power to pass the necessary acts. It is pretty evident, that the small states in the convention had an idea, that this power was lodged in Congress; and upon this principle only can we account for the last part of the article—“That no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate.” To make a provision, at this time, that it shall not be in the power of the legislatures of three fourths of the states to alter the principles of representation in the senate, seems to be a useless and unnecessary precaution. The late convention have fully demonstrated what regard is to be paid to such provision—for notwithstanding, the present confederation provides, that no alteration shall be made in it, without the consent of all the legislatures,1 yet, we find a plan proposed which may entirely exclude four states from the union. The provision, therefore, in this view has no weight in it. But in the other view, it is wise and cautious in the small states. Yet, there may hereafter be found an ambiguity in the words “equal suffrage.” And the large states may insist upon having the number of their senators encreased, so as to give them an equal suffrage with the small states. This constitution will undoubtedly be the most unexceptionable—Therefore I do not see that the small states have secured any thing more, than a representation in the senate upon the principles of equity. It is expressly stipulated, that there shall be two senators from each state, and that each senator shall have one vote—yet, I do not find that it is stipulated that there shall be only two and no more. I have several more observations to make, which I must postpone to another opportunity, and conclude with repeating, that the people are by the constitution to convey all the power they possess, or can convey, to the legislature. That it is left with the legislature to alter the arrangement and deposit of the powers, in such manner as they may deem necessary. On these principles alone can I account for Mr. Wilson’s high encomium on the constitution,2 for otherwise, it seems to contain the seeds of its own dissolution."
Newspaper,No,Vox Populi,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/23/1787,"To the PEOPLE of MASSACHUSETTS. Fellow-Citizens, At this all important crisis you should allow no object however great to divert your attention from the proposed system of federal government: now is its day of probation, but that day will soon expire, and you should work the work of the day while it is yet day, before the night cometh wherein no man can work; if you like the foolish virgins sleep till the midnight cry is heard, your applications after that will all prove fruitless. The adoption of the proposed constitution ought not to be considered as a matter of indifference, that event will undoubtedly be very advantageous or injurious, and it is yours at present to investigate the matter fully, and determine on the matter according to the best judgment you are able to form on such an investigation; if you accept it you ought to be fully convinced it is for the best; if you reject you should do it from a conviction that it is not adapted to promote the publick good. I have formerly invited your attention to the consideration of some of its parts, as well as some of the consequences which I conceived [310]would result from its adoption; I now wish you to attend to the sixth article thereof, where you will find it is provided, That the federal2 constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.—And the members of the several state legislatures and all judicial and executive officers, both of the United States and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution. Here you have the arcana of federal blessings laid open before you. A part of the supreme law is to be such as may be diametrically opposed to the sentiments of every citizen of this state as well as the sentiments of your representatives and senators in the federal legislature, some of which may be made only by the president and two thirds of a quorum of the senate. But is here not a difficulty involved in this matter which is rather hard of removal? Every other legislative, judicial or executive must be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution, and every such officer has taken or must take a solemn oath that he does [“]truly and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testify and declare that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is, and of right ought to be, a free sovereign and independent state,—and that he will bear true faith and allegiance to the said Commonwealth, and that he will defend the same against traiterous conspiracies and all hostile attempts whatsoever: and that no foreign prince, person, prelate, state, or potentate, hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, superiority, preeminence, dispensing authority or other power in any matter civil, ecclesiastical or spiritual, within this Commonwealth; except the authority and power which is or may be vested by their constituents in the Congress of the United States: and that no man, or body of men hath or can have any right to absolve or discharge him from the obligation of this oath, &c. and that he doth make this acknowledgment, &c. heartily and truly according to the common meaning and acceptation of the foregoing words, without any equivocation, mental evasion or secret reservation whatsoever.”3 How any honest man can take this oath, almost every word of which is emphatical and the same hour perhaps take the other I must confess to me is truly paradoxical: In the first of which he swears that this Commonwealth is, and of right ought to be, a free, sovereign and independent state, and that he will bear true faith and allegiance to it, and that no man or body of men can absolve him from that obligation. In the other he swears he will support a constitution which (it appears to me) takes away every idea [311]of sovereignty which is worth retaining. How these things can be reconciled is wholly beyond my conception. Will any one pretend to say these two oaths are compatible, because there is an exception in the state oath of such power and authority as is or may be by their constituents vested in the Congress of the United States, which exception contains every thing comprehended in the proposed constitution which the last oath binds them to support? Is it possible that any person can advance any thing like this? I cannot suppose any rational person can, for these two reasons, first the epithet “the Congress of the United States,” at the fabricating said oath, &c. was a definite phrase, its construction and organization were universally understood, and was known to be a body of men annually chosen, and recallable at pleasure, consisting of one branch only, and was a thing essentially different from the complex body which is to go under the name in the new proposed constitution, and we should do well to bear in mind that the oath concludes, “And I do make this declaration, &c. according to the common meaning and acceptation of the foregoing words, &c.[”] and I can see no help that can be obtained in this case from that proviso. But, secondly, if this matter was entirely got over, there would remain one which at least has the appearance of being insurmountable, for admitting the word Congress in the said oath to mean any thing and every thing which is called by that name, even then that exception could not be applied to any thing but a Congress, yet in the proposed constitution there is provision made for the exercise of power and authority within and concerning this commonwealth, and to which we are subject by an authority different from the Congress of the United States. According to the proposed constitution, treaties are to be made by the president, with the advice of two thirds of the senate present, if there is present a quorum. The president and senate are to appoint the judges, &c. The president, in person, is a potentate, holding free and exclusive power to pardon. Viewing him in military point of light, we are all personally to be under his immediate command, and at his disposal, &c. &c. &c. All this, and more, is proposed, in the new constitution, to be authorities to which we and our state-rulers are to be subject, which is distinct from Congress; for the president, or the president and senate, cannot be Congress: for it is expressly declared and defined in the proposed constitution, that Congress shall consist of a senate and a house of representatives, and I cannot conceive of any other way to get clear of the difficulty, at present. Paying suitable attention to these things, I leave it cheerfully with every person to judge, if any man can take and subscribe the two oaths, aforesaid, without being guilty of the most unequivocal perjury. If after a mature investigation of the subject, that should appear to be the case, it is left to the reflection of every one to picture in his own mind the eligibility of our circumstances, when the proposed constitution is adopted; and consider the precarious tenure by which they will all hold their lives, liberties and properties, if it is impossible for any person to be in any state office over them, but such as are divested of the principles of honesty, and have reached the ne plus ultra of wickedness—Perjury. These things, my fellow citizens, are proposed for your consideration, and yours must be the consequence of the determination you make on the subject. Boston, November 19."
Newspaper,No,A Federalist,,Boston Gazette,,11/26/1787,"Mess’rs. EDES’, I am pleased to see a spirit of inquiry burst the band of constraint upon the subject of the new plan for consolidating the governments of the United States, as recommended by the late Convention. If it is suitable to the genius and habits of the citizens of these states, it will bear the strictest scrutiny. The people are the grand inquest who have a right to judge of its merits. The hideous demon of Aristocracy has hitherto had so much influence as to bar the channels of investigation, preclude the people from inquiry and extinguish [321]every spark of liberal information of its qualities. At length the luminary of intelligence begins to beam its effulgent rays upon this important production; the deceptive mists cast before the eyes of the people by the delusive machinations of its interested advocates begins to dissipate, as darkness flies before the burning taper; and I dare venture to predict, that in spite of those mercenary declaimers, the plan will have a candid and complete examination—those furious zealots who are for cramming it down the throats of the people, without allowing them either time or opportunity to scan or weigh it in the balance of their understandings, bear the same marks in their features as those who have been long wishing to erect an aristocracy in this Commonwealth—their menacing cry is for a rigid government, it matters little to them of what kind, provided it answers that description—As the plan now offered comes something near their wishes, and is the most consonant to their views of any they can hope for, they come boldly forward and demand its adoption—they brand with infamy every man who is not as determined and zealous in its favour as themselves—they cry aloud the whole must be swallowed or none at all, thinking thereby to preclude any amendment; they are afraid of having it abated of its present rigid aspect—they have strived to overawe or seduce printers to stifle and obstruct a free discussion, and have endeavoured to hasten it to a decision before the people can duly reflect upon its properties,—in order to deceive them, they incessantly declare that none can discover any defect in the system but bankrupts who wish no government, and officers of the present government who fear to lose a part of their power.—These zealous partizans may injure their own cause, and endanger the public tranquility by impeding a proper inquiry; the people may suspect the whole to be a dangerous plan, from such covered & designing schemes to enforce it upon them: compulsive or treacherous measures to establish any government whatever, will always excite jealousy among a free people: better remain single and alone, than blindly adopt whatever a few individuals shall demand, be they ever so wise; I had rather be a free citizen of the small republic of Massachusetts, than an oppressed subject of the great American empire: let all act understandingly or not at all—If we can confederate upon terms that will secure to us our liberties, it is an object highly desirable, because of its additional security to the whole—if the proposed plan proves such an one, I hope it will be adopted, but if it will endanger our liberties as it stands, let it be amended; in order to which it must and ought to be open to inspection and free inquiry—the inundation of abuse that has been thrown out upon the heads of those who have had any doubts of its universal good qualities, have been so redundant, [322]that it may not be improper to scan the characters of its most strenuous advocates: it will first be allowed that many undesigning citizens may wish its adoption from the best motives, but these are modest and silent, when compared to the greater number, who endeavour to suppress all attempts for investigation; these violent partizans are for having the people gulp down the gilded pill blind-folded, whole, & without any qualification whatever, these consist generally, of the noble order of C s,2 holders of public securities, men of great wealth and expectations of public office, B—k—s and L—y—s:3 these with their train of dependents from the Aristocratick combination—the L—y-r in particular, keep up an incessant declamation for its adoption, like greedy gudgeons they long to satiate their voracious stomacks with the golden bait—The numerous tribunals to be erected by the new plan of consolidated empire, will find employment for ten times their present numbers; these are the loaves and fishes for which they hunger; they will probably find it suited to their habits, if not to the habits of the people—There may be reasons for having but few of them in the State Convention, lest their “own” interest should be too strongly considered—The time draws near for the choice of Delegates, I hope my fellow-citizens will look well to the characters of their preference, and remember the Old Patriots of 75; they have never led them astray, nor need they fear to try them on this momentous occasion."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/27/1787,"To the PEOPLE of MASSACHUSETTS. In the Gazette of the 23d instant,2 I ascertained, from the state of other countries and the experience of mankind, that free countries are most friendly to commerce and to the rights of property. This produces greater internal tranquillity. For every man, finding sufficient employment for his active powers in the way of trade, agriculture and manufactures, feels no disposition to quarrel with his neighbour, nor with the government which protects him, and of which he is a constituent part. Of the truth of these positions we have abundant evidence in the history of our own country. Soon after the settlement of Massachusetts, and its formation into a commonwealth, in the earlier part of the last century, there was a sedition at Hingham and Weymouth. The governour passing by at that time with his guard, seized some of the mutineers and imprisoned them. This was complained of as a violation of [323]their rights, and the governour lost his election the next year; but the year afterwards was restored, and continued to be re-elected for several years.3 The government does not appear to have been disturbed again till the revocation of the charter in 1686, being a period of about half a century. Connecticut set out originally on the same principles, and has continued uniformly to exercise the powers of government to this time. During the last year, we had decisive evidences of the vigour of this kind of government. In Connecticut, the treason was restrained while it existed only in the form of conspiracy. In Vermont, the conspirators assembled in arms, but were suppressed by the exertions of the militia, under the direction of their sheriffs. In New-Hampshire, the attack was made on the legislature, but the insurrection was in a very few hours suppressed, and has never been renewed.4 In Massachusetts, the danger was, by delay, suffered to increase. One judicial court after another was stopped, and even the capital trembled. Still, however, when the supreme executive gave the signal, a force of many thousands of active, resolute men, took the field, during the severities of winter, and every difficulty vanished before them. Since that time we have been continually coalescing. The people have applied with diligence to their several occupations, and the whole country wears one face of improvement. Agriculture has been improved, manufactures multiplied, and trade prodigiously enlarged. These are the advantages of freedom in a growing country. While our resources have been thus rapidly increasing, the courts have set in every part of the commonwealth, without any guard to defend them; have tried causes of every kind, whether civil or criminal, and the sheriffs, have in no case been interrupted in the execution of their office. In those cases indeed, where the government was more particularly interested, mercy has been extended, but in civil causes, and in the case of moral offences, the law has been punctually executed. Damage done to individuals, during the tumults, has been repaired, by judgment of the courts of law, and the award has been carried into effect. This is the present state of affairs, when we are asked to relinquish that freedom which produces such happy effects. The attempt has been made to deprive us of such a beneficial system, and to substitute a rigid one in its stead, by criminally alarming our fears, exalting certain characters on one side, and villifying them on the other. I wish to say nothing of the merits or demerits of individuals; such arguments always do hurt. But assuredly my countrymen cannot fail to consider and determine who are the most worthy of confidence in a business of this magnitude:—Whether they will trust persons, who have, from their cradles, been incapable of comprehending any other [324]principles of government, than those of absolute power, and who have, in this very affair, tried to deprive them of their constitutional liberty, by a pitiful trick. They cannot avoid prefer[r]ing those who have uniformly exerted themselves to establish a limited government, and to secure to individuals all the liberty that is consistent with justice, between man and man, and whose efforts, by the smiles of Providence, have hitherto been crowned with the most splendid success. After the treatment we have received, we have a right to be jealous, and to guard our present constitution with the strictest care. It is the right of the people to judge, and they will do wisely to give an explicit instruction to their delegates in the proposed convention, not to agree to any proposition that will, in any degree, militate with that happy system of government under which Heaven has placed them. November 24, 1787"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/30/1787,"To the PEOPLE. It has been proved, from the clearest evidence, in two former papers, that a free government, I mean one in which the power frequently returns to the body of the people, is in principle the most stable and efficient of any kind; that such a government affords the most ready and effectual remedy for all injuries done to persons and the rights of property. It is true we have had a tender act. But what government has not some law in favour of debtors. The difficulty consists in finding one that is not more unfriendly to the creditors than ours. I am far from justifying such things. On the contrary I believe that it is universally true, that acts made to favour a part of the community are wrong in principle. All that is now intended is, to remark that we are not worse than other people in that respect which we most condemn. Probably the inquiry will be made, whence the complaints arise. This is easily answered. Let any man look round his own neighbourhood, and see if the people are not, with a very few exceptions, peaceable and attached to the government; if the country had ever within their knowledge more appearance of industry, improvement, and tranquillity; if there was ever more of the produce of all kinds together for the market; if their stock does not rapidly increase; if there was ever a more ready vent for their surplus; & if the average of prices is not about as high as was usual in a plentiful year before the war. These circumstances all denote a general prosperity. Some classes of citizens indeed suffer greatly. Two descriptions I at present recollect. The publick creditors form the first of these classes and they ought to, and will be, provided for. Let us for a moment consider their situation and prospects. The embar[r]assments consequent upon a war, and the usual reduction of prices immediately after a war, necessarily occasioned a want of punctuality in publick payments. Still however the publick debt has been very considerably reduced, not by the dirty and delusive scheme of depreciation, but the nominal sum. Applications are continually making for purchases in our eastern and western lands. Great exertions are making for clearing off the arrears of outstanding taxes, so that the certificates for interest on the state debt have considerably increased in value. This is a certain indication of returning credit. Congress this year disposed of a large tract of their lands towards paying the principal of their debt. Pennsylvania has discharged the whole of their part of the continental debt. New-York has nearly cleared its state debt, and [343]has located a large part of their new lands towards paying the continental demands. Other states have made considerable payments. Every day from these considerations the publick ability and inclination to satisfy their creditors increases. The exertions of last winter were as much to support publick as private credit. The prospect therefore of the publick creditors is brightening under the present system. If the new system should take effect without amendments, which however is hardly probable, the increase of expense will be death to the hopes of all creditors both of the continental and of the state. With respect however to our publick delays of payment we have the precedent of the best established countries in Europe. The other class of citizens to which I alluded was the ship-carpenters. All agree that their business is dull; but as nobody objects against a system of commercial regulations for the whole continent, that business may be relieved without subverting all the ancient foundations and laws which have the respect of the people. It is a very serious question whether giving to Congress the unlimited right to regulate trade would not injure them still further. It is evidently for the interest of the state to encourage our own trade as much as possible. But in a very large empire, as the whole states consolidated must be, there will always be a desire of the government to increase the trade of the capital, and to weaken the extremes. We should in that case be one of the extremes, and should feel all the impoverishment incident to that situation. Besides, a jealousy of our enterprising spirit, would always be an inducement to cramp our exertions. We must then be impoverished or we must rebel. The alternative is dreadful. At present this state is one of the most respectable and one of the most influential in the union. If we alone should object to receiving the system without amendments, there is no doubt but it would be amended. But the case is not quite so bad. New-York appears to have no disposition even to call a convention. If they should neglect, are we to lend our assistance to compel them by arms, and thus to kindle a civil war without any provocation on their part. Virginia has put off their convention till May, and appears to have no disposition to receive the new plan without amendments. Pennsylvania does not seem to be disposed to receive it as it is. The same objections are made in all the states, that the civil government which they have adopted and which secures their rights will be subverted. All the defenders of this system undertake to prove that the rights of the states and of the citizens are kept safe. The opposers of it agree that they will receive the least burdensome system which shall defend those rights. Both parties therefore found their arguments on the idea that these rights ought to be held [344]sacred. With this disposition is it not in every man’s mind better to recommit it to a new convention, or to Congress, which is a regular convention for the purpose, and to instruct our delegates to confine the system to the general purposes of the union, than to endeavour to force it through in its present form, and with so many opposers as it must have in every state on the continent. The case is not of such pressing necessity as some have represented. Europe is engaged and we are tranquil. Never therefore was an happier time for deliberation. The supporters of the measure are by no means afraid of insurrections taking place, but they are afraid that the present government will prove superiour to their assaults."
Newspaper,No,,,Cumberland Gazette,,11/30/1787,"Mr. WAIT, In your paper of the 15th of November1 I saw some observations on Mr. Gerry’s letter addressed to the President of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; among which I particularly noticed an answer to Mr. Gerry’s 3d important question;2 and a wish expressed that a Bill of Rights might be added to the Federal Constitution. The writer fully comprehending himself, I imagine, supposed every body else would comprehend him also. But I confess, at first sight, I did not; perhaps others did not—Upon a second reading I imagined his idea was that the United States should by a Bill of Rights secure to themselves their privileges, as the citizens of the several States had already secured to themselves their liberties. To make the idea still more explicit—As the citizens of the several States had established Legislatures for themselves, investing them with certain powers; but at the same time reserving to themselves certain rights, which the legislature might not infringe, or intermeddle with upon their peril: So now the United States, being about to establish a LEGISLATURE GENERAL, should reserve to themselves, by a Bill, certain Rights which the general legislature might not infringe, or intermeddle with upon their peril. If this was his idea, which I am now fully persuaded it was, I think it just. It will secure dignity and importance to the States; it will insure perfect liberty to the people; and the exercise of republican virtue will render them intirely happy as a nation.—Each State will be too important a personage to be imposed upon, and consequently their liberty will be secure. Collectedly they will be respectable, and have their rank among the nations of the world. A Bill of Rights upon those principles cannot be difficult to be formed. It will be short; because the number of personages concerned is small—but thirteen in number at present. It will be simple and easy; because no perplexity can attend it upon honest views. I therefore hope the idea will be attended to.—It is simply this:—The inhabitants of the several States wished for Government; and established it on principles beneficial and safe to themselves.—The thirteen united States wish for a general Government; and I flatter myself they will establish one equally beneficial and safe to the Union—securing to themselves, by a Bill of Rights, their privileges, as the citizens of the several States have secured to themselves their liberties. Such a Bill of Rights is undoubtedly necessary—such a Bill of Rights will undoubtedly take place, or the Constitution, which I revere as incomparable, will be politically damned;—because I think my countrymen sensible.—In vain will a particular citizen complain of injury, after the Constitution is once adopted; but a State may make the Congress tremble, if they dare to incroach. A word to the wise is sufficient; and wise men will never admit such a Constitution, however good, without the security of a Bill of Rights."
Letter,No,Mercy Otis Warren,Samuel A. Otis,,,12/1/1787,"I intended an immediate answer to your last favour, but prevented by indisposition I now resume the pen and begin with what is most interesting to your domestic feelings. I had the pleasure three days since of seeing Mrs Otis well in bed; a fine little plump girl looked round upon us—perhaps with anticipation and surprize at the odd mixture of good and evil that the entrance of the world presents,—perhaps she was looking for papa, however she appears a fine healthy little squab, and bids fair to be as beautiful as her sisters. Poor girl—it is said the sex are doomed to slavery, but I hope it will not be her hard fortune to be doubly so by marrying a slave. It appears to me the present generation are fast verging to that disgraceful state, for the want of principle to support the independent and honourable character of their ancestors;—this shews itself in their readiness to adopt the novelties of system makers—whither they are forging fetters in the furnace of a single despot, or whither they will be the still more absurd fabrication of an aristocratic junto. These are cant terms, but this does not make them less the objects of horror—though the frequency of expression may in some degree lessen the terrors of apprehension. As I always express my thoughts freely, when I can do it in confidence, let me tell you I think America has a set of as deep politicians manoeuvreing in her bosom, as any country can produce; I shall just touch on a political subject, somewhat different from those we have lately discussed. Every honest man must revolt at the idea of spunging the public debt, and every villain that may wish it would choose to shift the odium from himself. I hope the last days of the American Congress under the old confederation will not be marked with the infamy of such a proceedure. The sticklers for the new goverment may wish to precipitate the old to this measure or something equally odious before its dissolution. They may perhaps have a double motive for this. It is probable such an unpopular step might forever blast the memory of those gentlemen who had a hand therein, and totally destroy all confidence in them, while the officers of the new system will escape the stigma, and quietly enjoy the advantages of the folly of their predecessors. In the weak state Congress is now in it would be so absurd as well as unjust to attempt a measure so replete with consequences, that I cannot think it possible they, ever had it in serious contemplation. The whole continent may be duped out of their liberties by the plausibility of pretended patriots, [563]and the intrigues of statesmen of more address than integrity—probably the well designing may be cajoled by the plea of necessity to relinquish their honour. But if this or any similar measure should be pushed in the expiring pangs of the Amphyctionic body, who by their wisdom and firmness have made the proudest European nation tremble—I hope my brother will have the courage to seceed from their counsels, even if he stands alone. Indeed I believe it would appear very extraordinary in the eyes of the whole world, if in the present debilitated and nerveless state, anything very important should be attempted by the Congress now in session, much less will they presume on a measure unparallelled dangerous and iniquitous.—No—if this once respected body must die by the sentence of the people that called it in to existence, let it sink without the accumulation of guilt, and a load of infamy that would draw on each individual member, the curses of one part of mankind, and the ridicule of the other. This year is certainly the golden age of federalism, and when the new goverment is organized, which will probably be within a few months, let them (if it must be done, and perhaps it must) wipe off the old debts, the resources may be too small to do justice to old arrearages & to supply funds for the new ones that will be contracted to support the civil list, the military establishments, and the splendour of power that must illume this happy quarter of the globe; perhaps while the enthusiasm in their favour is kept up, and the spirit of adulation reigns, they may stretch their ample powers to enormities that no other period would justify. But it will not be many years before the inhabitants of the United States will see the error of their precipitant and mistaken zeal, and their misplaced confidence which has brought them down to a level with other nations by the intrigues of individuals—thus predicts your affectionate sister"
Letter,No,Samuel Adams,Richard Henry Lee,,,12/3/1787,"I am to acknowledge your several Favours of the 5th and 27 of October,2 the one by the Post and the other by our worthy Friend Mr Gerry. The Session of our General Court which lasted six Weeks, and my Station there3 requiring my punctual & constant Attendance, prevented my considering the new Constitution as it is already called, so closely as was necessary for me before I should venture an Opinion. I confess, as I enter the Building I stumble at the Threshold. I meet with a National Government, instead of a Federal Union of Sovereign States. I am not able to conceive why the Wisdom of the Convention led them to give the Preference to the former before the latter. If the several States in the Union are to become one entire Nation, under one Legislature, the Powers of which shall extend to every Subject of Legislation, and its Laws be supreme & controul the whole, the Idea of Sovereignty in these States must be lost. Indeed I think, upon such a Supposition, those Sovereignties ought to be eradicated from the Mind; for they would be Imperia in Imperio justly deemd a Solecism in Politicks, & they would be highly dangerous, and destructive of the Peace Union and Safety of the Nation. And can this National Legislature be competent to make Laws for the free internal Government of [350]one People, living in Climates so remote and whose “Habits & particular Interests” are and probably always will be so different. Is it to be expected that General Laws can be adapted to the Feelings of the more Eastern & the more Southern Parts of so extensive a Nation? It appears to me difficult if practicable. Hence then may we not look for Discontent, Mistrust, Disaffection to Government and frequent Insurrections, which will require standing Armies to suppress them in one Place & another where they may happen to arise. Or if Laws could be made, adapted to the local Habits Feelings, Views & Interests of those distant Parts, would they not cause Jealousies of Partiality in Government which would excite Envy and other malignant Passions productive of Wars and fighting. But should we continue distinct sovereig[n] States, confederated for the Purposes of mutual Safety and Happiness, each contributing to the Federal Head such a Part of its Sovereignty as would render the Government fully adequate to those Purposes and no more, the People would govern themselves more easily, the Laws of each State being well adapted to its own Genius & Circumstances, and the Liberties of the United States would be more secure than they can be, as I humbly conceive, under the proposed new Constitution. You are sensible, Sir, that the Seeds of Aristocracy began to spring even before the Conclusion of our Struggle for the natural Rights of Men. Seeds which like a Canker Worm lie at the Root of free Governments. So great is the Wickedness of some Men, & the stupid Servility of others, that one would be almost inclined to conclude that Communities cannot be free. The few haughty Families, think They must govern. The Body of the People tamely consent & submit to be their Slaves. This unravels the Mystery of Millions being enslaved by the few! But I must desist—My weak hand prevents my proceeding further at present. I will send you my poor Opinion of the political Structure at another Time. In the Interim oblige me with your Letters; & present mine & Mrs A’s best Regards to your Lady & Family, Colo Francis, Mr A. L. if with you,4 & other Friends. [P.S.] As I thought it a Piece of Justice I have venturd to say that I had often heard from the best Patriots from Virginia that Mr G Mason was an early active & able Advocate for the Liberties of America,5"
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,12/3/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The chief blessings of society, like individuals, are fond of association, and have a mutual dependence upon each other. They form links of one chain, and are all actuated by the same cause. Where freedom prevails, industry and science there also prevail. Industry produces wealth, and science preserves freedom in purity. The majority of the people in all such countries become so active in their different pursuits, that they are deprived both of their time and opportunity to inform themselves of the principles of the government by which those great blessings are secured to them, and almost implicitly rely both for the explaining and for the enforcing of those principles upon the patriotism of those, their fellow-citizens, who labour but in the field of enquiry, and who spend their whole time in researches after knowledge. Thanks be to Heaven, that in America, that majority always retaining the power, the others have never dared to enforce their principles, without previous explanation, and it has become natural to mankind, wherever they have a system of any kind, a favorite, if it is as genuine and honest in principle, as in appearance, they leave no active powers of the mind unessayed, in elucidating, explaining and enlarging upon its benefits to those whom they wish should adopt it—all its good qualities are delineated, and every exertion is made to refute all objections offered against it, which exertions will be crowned with success, if the [352]objections in themselves are futile, and will not bear the force of light and argument. The malevolent passions of the heart are not called in, private faults of individuals are not raked from oblivion and magnified, invidious representations are not made, neither are the slanderous, envenomed darts of malice and envy hurled against those characters, who yesterday were deemed praise-worthy and held sacred for a series of obligations conferred by them upon their country, but to-day are execrated with passion, because they do not in all points see as other men see. On the contrary, cool reasoning and dispassionate argument, are of themselves sufficient to build up such a system, to unravel all its mysteries, and to present to the people in expressive, legible colours, the blessings that will result from its adoption. Where this mode of conduct is not pursued by its advocates, where instead of cool reasoning upon the subject in question, artful evasions are presented, the system itself is winked out of sight, instead of dispassionate endeavours to remove difficulties arising in honest minds, which are offered with decency to the public in order to be refuted, those who make them are loaded with the opprobious terms of Insurgents, destroyers of all government, bankrupts, defaulters, and anti-federalists, which is worse than jacobitism: Where, instead of promoting free discussions upon the most important subject ever before a community, attempts are made to fetter and suppress such discussions, by THREATNING the Printer and DROPPING the papers that contain them: Where, instead of coming forward like men, in the full exercise of reason, like fellow-citizens warmed with a patriotick ardour for their country, emulous to secure and preserve its sacred principles, and with proper weapons disarming their fellow-citizens of those objections, they blast and asperse their characters (the dernier resort of all supporters of a bad cause) I say the people have a fair, undoubted right to presume those objections unanswerable, the system itself essentially defective, and that its advocates are, by their conduct, endeavouring not to reason, but to surprize the people into a hasty approbation of it.— That this is the case with the supporters of the proceedings of the Federal Convention, far be it from me to declare.—Judge, my fellow-citizens, for yourselves—examine the public prints from the promulgation of this Constitution. Objections there you will find in score—are they offered with decency? Do they attack men or measures? Are they answered in the same manner? And do you discover a desire in those who wish you to embrace this Government, to inform you of its principles, and the consequences which will probably ensue from such principles—why they have taken from you the sinews of your present [353]government, and instead of revising and amending your Confederation; have handed you a new one, contrasted in the plenitude of its powers.—As you answer these questions, so you must make up your opinion upon that which is before you. They have the power of “organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and of governing them when in service of the United States, giving to the seperate States the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.” Let us enquire, why they have assumed this power, for if it is for the purpose of forming you into one uniform, solid body throughout the United States, making you respectable both at home and abroad—of arming you more compleatly and exercising you oftener—of strengthening the power which is now lodged in your hands, and relying upon you and you solely for aid and support to the civil power in the execution of all the laws of the New Congress, it certainly can be no where better placed under the restrictions therein mentioned, than in that body. But is this probable. Does the complection of the proceedings countenance such a supposition? When they un-precedently claim the power of raising and supporting standing armies; do they tell you for what purposes they are to be raised?—How they are to be employed?—How many they are to consist of, and where to be stationed?—Is this power fettered with any one of these necessary restrictions which will shew they depend upon the militia, and not upon this infernal engine of oppression to execute their civil laws. The nature of the demand in itself contradicts such a supposition, and forces you to believe that it is for none of these causes—but rather for the purpose of consolidating and finally destroying your strength, as your respective Governments are to be destroyed. They well know the impolicy of putting or keeping arms in the hands of a nervous people, at a distance from the Seat of Government, upon whom they mean to exercise the powers granted in that Government.—They have no idea of calling upon the party aggrieved to support and enforce their own grievances. They are aware of the necessity of catching Samson asleep to trim him of his locks. It is asserted by the most respectable writers upon Government, that a well regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people; and, says the celebrated Mr. Hume, “without it, it is folly to think any free government will have stability or security—When the sword is introduced, as in our constitution (speaking of the British) the person entrusted will always neglect to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretext for keeping up a standing army; and it is evident this is a mortal distemper in the British [354]parliament, of which it must finally inevitably perish.”2—If they have not the same design, why do they wish a standing army unrestrained? It is universally agreed, that a militia and a standing body of troops never yet flourished in the same soil. Tyrants have uniformly depended upon the latter, at the expence of the former. Experience has taught them, that a standing body of regular forces, where ever they can be compleatly introduced, are always efficacious in enforcing their edicts, however arbitrary, and slaves by profession themselves, are “nothing loath” to break down the barriers of freedom with a goùt.—No, my fellow-citizens, this plainly shews they do not mean to depend upon the citizens of the States alone to enforce their powers, wherefore it is their policy to neglect them, and lean upon something more substantial and summary. It is true, they have left the appointment of officers in the breast of the several States; but this to me, appears an insult, rather than a priveledge, for what avails this right, if they in their pleasure should choose to neglect to arm, organize and discipline the men over whom such Officers are to be appointed. It is a bait, that you might be led to suppose they did intend to apply to them in all cases, and to pay particular attention to making them the bulwark of this Continent.—And would they not be equal to such an undertaking?—Are they not abundantly able to give security and stability to your government as long as it is free? Are they not the only proper persons to do it? Are they not the most respectable body of yeomanry in that character upon earth? Have they not been deeply engaged in some of the most brilliant actions in America, and more than once decided the fate of armies? In short, do they not preclude the necessity of any standing army whatsoever, unless in case of invasion; and in that case it would be time enough to raise them, for no free government under Heaven, with a well disciplined militia was ever yet subdued by mercenary troops. The advocates at the present day, for a standing army in the New Congress pretend it is necessary for the respectability of government. I defy them to produce an instance in any country, in the Old or New World, where they have not finally done away the liberties of the people:—Every writer upon government,—Lock, Sidney, Hamden, and a list of others have uniformly asserted, that standing armies are a solecism in any government; that no nation ever supported them, that did not resort to, rely upon, and finally become a prey to them.—No Western Historians have yet been hardy enough to advance principles that look a different way. What historians have asserted, all the Grecian Republicks have verified—They are brought up to obedience and unconditional submission.—With arms in their hands, they are taught to feel the weight of rigid discipline:—They are excluded from the enjoyments [355]which liberty gives to its votaries, they, in consequence, hate and envy the rest of the community in which they are placed, and indulge a malignant pleasure in destroying those privileges to which they never can be admitted.—“Without them, says the Marquis of Beccaria, in every society there is an effort constantly tending to confer on one part the height of power, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery, and this is of itself sufficient to employ the people’s attention.”3 There is no instance of any government being reduced to a confirmed tyranny without military oppression; and the first policy of tyrants has been to annihilate all other means of national activity and defence, and to rely solely upon standing troops.—Repeated were the trials before the Sovereigns of Europe dared to introduce them upon any pretext whatever; and the whole record of the transactions of mankind cannot furnish an instance (unless the proceedings of the Convention may now be called a part of that record) where the motives which caused their establishment, were not completely disguised.—Pisistratus in Greece, and Dyonysius in Syracuse, Charles in France, and Henry in England, all cloaked their villainous intentions under an idea of raising a small body for a guard to their persons; and Spain, could not succeed in the same nefarious plan, until through the influence of the ambitious Priest, they were called upon to resist the progress of the Infidels.4 “Cæsar, who first attacked the commonwealth with mines, very soon opened his batteries.”5—Notwithstanding all these objections to this engine of oppression, which are made by the most experienced men, and confirmed by every country, where the rays of freedom ever extended.—Yet in America, which has hitherto been her favorite abode—in this civilized territory, where property is valuable, and men are found with feelings that will not patiently submit to arbitrary controul—in this Western region, where, my fellow-countrymen, it is confessedly proper that you should associate and dwell in society from choice and reflection, and not be kept together by force and fear, you are modestly requested to engraft into the component parts of your Constitution, a STANDING ARMY, without any qualifying restraints whatever,—certainly to exist somewhere within the bowels of your country in time of peace. It is very true, that the celebrated Mr. Wilson, a member of the Convention, and who we may suppose breathes, in some measure, the spirit of that body, tells you, it is for the purpose of forming cantonments upon your frontiers, and for the dignity and safety of your country, as it respects foreign nations.6 No man that loves his country could object to their being raised for the first of these causes, but for the last it cannot be necessary. God has so separated us by an extensive ocean from the rest of mankind, he hath so liberally [356]endowed us with privileges, and so abundantly taught us to esteem them precious, it would be impossible, while we retain our integrity and advert to first principles, for any nation whatever to subdue us. We have succeeded in an opposition to the most powerful people upon the globe; and the wound that America received in the struggle, where is it? As speedily healed as the track in the ocean is buried by the succeeding wave. It has scarcely stopped her progress, and our private dissentions only at this moment, tarnish the lustre of the most illustrious infant nation under Heaven. You cannot help suspecting this gentleman, when he goes on to tell you, “that standing armies in time of peace, have always been a topic of popular declamation, but Europe hath found them necessary to maintain the appearance of strength in a season of the most profound tranquility.”7—This shews you his opinion, and that he as one of the Convention, was for unequivocally establishing them in time of peace; and to object to them is mere popular declamation. But I will not, my countrymen, I cannot believe you to be of the same sentiment. Where is the standing army in the world, that, like the musquet they make use of, hath been, in time of peace, brightned and burnished for the sake only of maintaining an appearance of strength, without being put to a different use, without having had a pernicious influence upon the morals, the habits, and the sentiments of society, and finally, taking a chief part in executing its laws. But some say, that there is a controul over them, and that consists in the appropriation of monies for their support. Turn your attention to England, and see the popular part of this constitution by the influence of money, by the influence of military and revenue officers, brought gravely to give their annual assent to the existence of a standing army, and for monies to support it. It has long since been an insult on the good sense of that nation. It may not be amiss to remind you of that swarm of revenue, excise, impost and stamp officers, Continental assessors and collectors, that your new Constitution will introduce among you. They will, of themselves, be a STANDING ARMY to you, and you will see them at your elections, active and industr[i]ous to secure the seats of those men who put them into office:—They will be very adequate to give you a surfeit of their company, to make you tired in meddling with government, and disposed to become indifferent about the exercise of it, without the blessed assistance of any military corps.— Upon the whole, my countrymen, it appears to me, that this power as it now stands, is decidedly improper and dangerous. That Congress ought to have the power of raising armies when invaded by our enemies, [357]is certain; that they ought not to have it for any other cause, is equally so. If they did not or do not mean to employ them in any other way, they ought in express terms to say so, in a Bill of Rights. They never ought to exist at all, but in subordination to civil authority. If the people are not in general disposed to execute the powers of government, it is time to suspect there is something wrong in that government, and rather than employ a standing army, they had better have another; for, in my humble opinion, it is yet much too early to set it down for a fact, that mankind cannot be governed, but by force."
Newspaper,No,The Monitor,,American Herald,,12/3/1787,"A knowledge of the principles of government, is so essential to the welfare of mankind, that every opportunity which might tend to promote an enquiry into so important a subject, ought to be embraced by every one who has a sense of the dignity of man, and the rights of human nature—For by being acquainted with whatever may strike the imagination of those whose opinions are opposed to each other, the unprejudiced mind might be enabled to suggest a form that would consolidate the social compact into a perfect enjoyment of political happiness. Freedom hath had to encounter with various acts of oppression, till at length, after struggling in contests that have afforded the most affecting meditations, she reared her temple in the United States, where the blessings of providence are secure and permanent in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property—and the period may not be far off, when she will completely deliver the world from all other usurpations but those which may result from the deliberations of disinterested hearts. The favourable termination of the American war, opened a new source of political enquiry throughout the world. The rights of human nature—the comprehensive views of reason and conscience—were more generally investigated and better understood. The meanest citizen spoke with an elevation of mind, before unknown in the European governments. Monarchs began to view their subjects as rational beings; and, with limitted indulgences, have removed many establishments that debased the character of those nations—while others have endeavoured to place their subjects upon that natural equality, which a benevolent heart will ever be strenuous in promoting. The prevailing disposition of human nature to plunge from one extreme into another, rendered it necessary to adopt wholesome regulations for their mutual benefit, that each might be secure from the gratification of individual avarice, and participate in the blessings of civilized society. This was the origin and intent of government, and so long as virtue prevailed, mankind enjoyed the blessings resulting therefrom. But at length different orders were created—authority assumed to itself the right of government—candidates fought against each other, and accustomed the harmless to slaughter—military leaders were established in authority, and the blood of thousands were sacrificed to support hereditary distinctions. Here the horrors of a sorrowful and dejected countenance submitted to the arms of tyranny and despotism—the original mild and ingenuous manners of civil society were [359page icon]held in bondage, and obliged to submit to the dictates of those, whose pretended acts of benevolence were founded on the principles of avarice and superstition. Thus we find ambition will prevail, where authority is vested with wealth and power, and no country can preserve their liberties, who grant an unlimitted indulgence to either. That every man should interest himself in his own private concerns, will be admitted by all—but, at the same time, he should never withdraw his attention from that of the community in which he may be a member; for whatever concerns them in a collective capacity, he is in duty bound to consider, as being equally entitled to the advantages resulting therefrom. The grand palladium of the freedom of this country, the Declaration of Rights, ought to be read and well understood by every citizen; for on them alone rests the political salvation of this country. We there find sufficient energy is given, to compel obidence [i.e., obedience] to legislative authority—a perfect equality is preserved in the several branches of civil power, by a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles—and the whole cemented by a firm adherence to moderation and justice. In them, we find the rulers and the ruled equally participating of the blessings of liberty and property, and are equally secured in their rights and privileges as freemen. Of how much importance is it, then, to every citizen, to preserve these inestimable blessings, and duly to consider every subject which might tend to the preservation of them! It ought to be the duty of parents particularly to inculcate into the minds of the rising generation, the noble Principles of Virtue and Patriotism—by example and advice to impress on their minds, the domestic as well as public advantages resulting from industry and economy—For the concomitant blessings of liberty and peace have ever been found, where they have been the prevailing principles."
Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,12/3/1787,"Some of the papers of the last week have suggested the idea, that the public creditors, and some of the whigs of 1775, began to think of the disgraceful scheme of a re-union with Britain.1—It is certain that no such scheme can take effect; for Britain is so immersed in debt that the interest alone exceeds the interest and principal of both Continental and State debts.—Their revenue falls short by near two millions annually; while by the sale of our lands the principal of our debt every day dec[r]eases in the nominal sum; and by the exertions of the people to pay off the arrears of their taxes, our revenue is continually working [360]clear. While we lament that, from the embarrassments common at the end of a war, it has not been in our power to be punctual in discharging our public or private debts, it is easy to shew that the actual managements have not been worse than in the most enlightened countries of Europe, but that we have shewn in every instance as sacred a regard to the rights of property as they have done. If any conspiracy of that kind is forming, it is an additional reason for extreme caution on the part of the State, and for making our excellent Constitution the beacon by which we shall guide all our steps, and the light that shall brighten our paths. By this means we shall effectually defeat the designs of those who wish to do us harm. QUERE. Is not a Conspiracy against the Liberties of the People, as criminal as a Conspiracy to deprive the Government of its Power?—"
Newspaper,No,One of the Common People,,Boston Gazette,,12/3/1787,"Messieurs EDES, A writer in the Centinel who calls himself “One of the middle-interest,” has gone into a long inquiry to find out “where we learned the idea of a Bill of Rights.” It is of little moment where it was learned, since we are possessed of so important and so invaluable a discovery, to guard the people against the increasing powers of artificial aristocracy, whose seeds are every where disseminated in free states. This writer thinks it would be superfluous to preface or combine with the federal constitution, a bill of rights, because the state constitution is already guarded by one.—If the new plan is adopted, every one knows the state constitution will be very materially and essentially altered; and so far will the security of our rights be precarious and dependent on meer acts of congress, which, without this barrier, may, and by the present tenor of the new constitution, will render our priviledges as undefined as this writer says are those of the subjects of England; which are only to be “collected from meer opinions of the learned and contradictory [368page icon]authors.” If we alienate a great part of the powers, at present contained in our state constitution, and vest them in congress, why is it not as necessary that those alienated powers should be secured and limited by a declaration of rights, as that the remaining powers which are left in the hands of the state government should be thus guarded, especially if the greater half are alienated? This writer says, a bill of rights is not necessary, because the first section declares “that all legislative powers herein given (viz. given in the new constitution) shall be vested in congress;” and then says, “the legislative powers not given are not surely in congress.”—But will he say that the powers therein given are clearly and explicitly defined? that the boundary line of the legislative jurisdiction given to congress is so plain as not to be mistaken or abused? that it will never clash with the jurisdiction claimed by the legislature of this state? Is the following clause of such a nature as to have any fixed or definite limits? “This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”—Unless some additional guard is added to define the above clause, here will be a fine field for ambitious or designing men to extend the federal jurisdiction.—In the course of a few years our state legislature will be annihilated, together with our bill of rights, which this writer says is a sufficient security: our rights will then depend on the virtue of the federal legislature; our privileges will then be sought after in a mass of mutilated laws, in volumes of contradictory reports of the learned. When this federal government is established, we shall have two bodies to legislate for us, and unless the powers which each body will have a right to exercise, be clearly defined, we must expect nothing but rival discord and contention, until the federal authority gains the ascendancy, as above predicted; or what may be worse, a revolt from their domination. This writer asks—“Where is the liberty of the press taken away?” If congress have a right to controul it, they may be said to have a right to take it away.—Will not the United States Attorney have the power to prosecute any printer for a pretended libel against the United States? Will not a printer be triable for a pretended libel against any foreign minister or consul, or for a libel against any of the individual states, by a federal tribunal? Are not such prosecutions warranted by the following clause in the new constitution? “all controversies wherein the United States shall be a party, all cases affecting foreign ministers and consuls, and all controversies between a citizen and a state,” shall be cognizable before a federal tribunal.—Cannot congress by virtue of this clause, restrain all publick information of mal-administration? And will not congress have absolute uncontrolled power over printers, and every other person within the United States territory, where there will undoubtedly be a great city? Never was the trial by jury in civil cases thought so lightly of in America as at this day: we have bled for it, and are now almost ready to trifle it away—because in cases of default (which implies a consent of parties) there is no trial by jury, we must give up that inestimable privilege in all civil cases whatever.—This is fine reasoning sure; because we will not have a jury when we do not want them, we shall not when we do—This gentleman cannot be serious when he asserts, that “if it were to be expressed what civil causes should be tried by jury, it might take a volume of laws, instead of an article of rights;” If it did I would have the volume, rather than hazard the priviledge.—But I will ask whether it requires this volume of laws to express that privilege in our state constitution? and whether there would be any difficulty in having it declared, that the citizens of each state shall enjoy it conformably to the usage in the state where the tribunal shall be established? he says “doubtless congress will make some general regulations in this matter,” but it will be well to recollect that they may unmake them, or not make them too, if they please, and when they please; but if it is a part of the constitution, the people alone will have the power to change or annul it.—It is too great a privilege to be left at loose. I sincerely believe if the federal constitution which shall be given, be clearly defined, and a boundary line be marked out, declaratory of the extent of their jurisdiction, of the rights which the state hold unalienable, and the privilege which the citizens thereof can never part with, the republick of America will last for ages, and be free."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/4/1787,"To the PEOPLE. Having considered some of the principal advantages of the happy form of government under which it is our peculiar good fortune to live, we find by experience, that it is the best calculated of any form hitherto invented, to secure to us the rights of our persons and of our property, and that the general circumstances of the people shew an advanced state of improvement never before known. We have found the shock given by the war in a great measure obliterated, and the publick debt contracted at that time to be considerably reduced in the nominal sum. The Congress lands are fully adequate to the redemption of the principal of their debt, and are selling and populating very fast.1 The lands of this state, at the west, are, at the moderate price of eighteen pence an acre, worth near half a million pounds in our money. They ought, therefore, to be sold as quick as possible. An application was made lately for a large tract at that price,2 and continual applications [382]are made for other lands in the eastern part of the state.3 Our resources are daily augmenting. We find, then, that after the experience of near two centuries our separate governments are in full vigour. They discover, for all the purposes of internal regulation, every symptom of strength, and none of decay. The new system is, therefore, for such purposes, useless and burdensome. Let us now consider how far it is practicable consistent with the happiness of the people and their freedom. It is the opinion of the ablest writers on the subject, that no extensive empire can be governed upon republican principles, and that such a government will degenerate to a despotism, unless it be made up of a confederacy of smaller states, each having the full powers of internal regulation. This is precisely the principle which has hitherto preserved our freedom. No instance can be found of any free government of considerable extent which has been supported upon any other plan. Large and consolidated empires may indeed dazzle the eyes of a distant spectator with their splendour, but if examined more nearly are always found to be full of misery. The reason is obvious. In large states the same principles of legislation will not apply to all the parts. The inhabitants of warmer climates are more dissolute in their manners, and less industrious, than in colder countries. A degree of severity is, therefore, necessary with one which would cramp the spirit of the other. We accordingly find that the very great empires have always been despotick. They have indeed tried to remedy the inconveniences to which the people were exposed by local regulations; but these contrivances have never answered the end. The laws not being made by the people, who felt the inconveniences, did not suit their circumstances. It is under such tyranny that the Spanish provinces languish, and such would be our misfortune and degradation, if we should submit to have the concerns of the whole empire managed by one legislature. To promote the happiness of the people it is necessary that there should be local laws; and it is necessary that those laws should be made by the representatives of those who are immediately subject to the want of them. By endeavouring to suit both extremes, both are injured. It is impossible for one code of laws to suit Georgia and Massachusetts. They must, therefore, legislate for themselves. Yet there is, I believe, not one point of legislation that is not surrendered in the proposed plan. Questions of every kind respecting property are determinable in a continental court, and so are all kinds of criminal causes. The continental legislature has, therefore, a right to make rules in all cases by which their judicial courts shall proceed and decide [383]causes. No rights are reserved to the citizens. The laws of Congress are in all cases to be the supreme law of the land, and paramount to the constitutions of the individual states. The Congress may institute what modes of trial they please, and no plea drawn from the constitution of any state can avail. This new system is, therefore, a consolidation of all the states into one large mass, however diverse the parts may be of which it is to be composed. The idea of an uncompounded republick, on an average, one thousand miles in length, and eight hundred in breadth, and containing six millions of white inhabitants4 all reduced to the same standard of morals, of habits, and of laws, is in itself an absurdity, and contrary to the whole experience of mankind. The attempt made by Great-Britain to introduce such a system, struck us with horrour, and when it was proposed by some theorists that we should be represented in parliament, we uniformly declared that one legislature could not represent so many different interests for the purposes of legislation and taxation. This was the leading principle of the revolution, and makes an essential article in our creed. All that part, therefore, of the new system, which relates to the internal government of the states, ought at once to be rejected."
Newspaper,No,Z,,Independent Chronicle,,12/6/1787,"Mess’rs. Adams & Nourse, When I read Dr. FRANKLIN’s address to the President of the late Convention, in the last Monday’s Gazette, I was at a loss to judge, till I was informed by mere accident, from which of the contending parties it went to the press. “I confess,” says the Doctor, (and observe the Printers tell us it was immediately before his signing)” I confess that I do not entirely approve of this Constitution at present.” Surely, I thought, no zealous federalist, in his right mind, would have exposed his cause so much as to publish to the world that this great philosopher did not entirely approve the Constitution at the very moment when his “hand marked” his approbation of it; especially after the federalists themselves had so often and so loudly proclaimed, that he had fully and decidedly adopted it. The Doctor adds, “I am not sure I shall never approve it.” This then is the only remaining hope of the federalists, so far as the Doctor’s judgment is or may be of any service to their cause, that one time or another he may approve the new Constitution. Again, says the Doctor, “In these sentiments I agree to this Constitution, with all its faults, if they are such; because I think a general government necessary for us, and there is no FORM of government but what may be a blessing to the people, if well administered.” But are we to accept a form of government which we do not entirely approve of, merely in hopes that it will be administered well? Does not every man know, that nothing is more liable to be abused than power. Power, without a check, in any hands, is tyranny; and such powers, in the hands of even good men, so infatuating is the nature of it, will probably be wantonly, if not tyrannically exercised. The world has had experience enough of this, in every stage of it. Those among us who cannot entirely approve the new Constitution as it is called, are of opinion, in order that any form may be well administered, and thus be made a blessing to the people, that there ought to be at least, an express reservation of certain inherent unalienable rights, which it would be equally sacrilegious for the people to give away, as for the government to invade. If the rights of conscience, for instance, are not sacredly reserved to the people, what security will there be, in case the government should have in their heads a predilection for any one sect in religion? what will hinder the civil power from erecting a national system of religion, and committing the law to a set of lordly priests, reaching, as the great Dr. Mayhew expressed it, from the desk to the skies?14 An Hierarchy which has ever been the grand engine in the hand of civil tyranny; and tyrants in return will afford them opportunity enough to vent their rage on stubborn hereticks, by wholesome severities, as they were called by national religionists, in a country which has long boasted its freedom. It was doubtless for the peace of that nation, that there should be an uniformity in religion, and for the same wise and good reason, the act of uniformity remains in force to these enlightened times.15 The Doctor says, he is “not sure that this [is] not the best Constitution that we may expect.” Nor can he be sure that it might not have been made better than it now is, if the Convention had adjourned to a distant day, that they might have availed themselves of the sentiments of the people at large. It would have been no great condescension, even in that august Body, to have shown so small a testimony of regard to the judgment of their constituents. Would it not be acting more like men who wish for a safe as well as a stable government, to propose such amendments as would meliorate the form, than to approve it, as the Dr. would have us, “with all its faults, if they are such.” Thus the Doctor consents, and hopes the Convention will [“]act heartily and unanimously in recommending the Constitution, wherever their influence may extend, and turn their future tho’ts and endeavors to the means of having it well administered.”16 Even a bad form of government may, in the Doctor’s opinion, be well administered—for, says he, there is no form of government, but what may be made a blessing to the people, if well administered. He evidently, I think, builds his hopes, that the Constitution proposed, will be a blessing to the people,—not on the principles of the government itself, but on the possibility, that, with all its faults, it may be well administered;—and concludes, with wishing, that others, who had objections to it, would yet, like him, doubt of their own infallibility, and put their names to the instrument, to make an Unanimity MANIFEST! No wonder he shed a tear,17 as it is said he did, when he gave his sanction to the New Constitution."
Newspaper,No,,,Cumberland Gazette,,12/6/1787,"What we feared, hath come upon us.19 The great Franklin hath signed the national constitution, not because he conceived it to be good, but because it might have been worse. Who can read his prediction of Despotism without a tear?20—LIBERTY! fair goddess—must we part with thee!"
Newspaper,No,,,Cumberland Gazette,,12/6/1787,"Mr. Wait, “To be, or not to be; that’s the question.” It is, or it may be. Are the United States of America to be melted down into nothing? or are they to retain their dignity and importance? Are they to enjoy the privileges they now possess? or are they to have such as Congress may please to give them? For it is manifest that so large an extent of territory as belongs to the United States cannot be governed in one district. It therefore must be divided. The division must be made by Congress; or it must arise from the States that now exist, or hereafter may exist. In the former case, the districts will have such privileges as Congress may, from time to time, see fit to give them; which privileges Congress may also curtail at pleasure:—in the latter case, the States will possess and enjoy the privileges they ought to have for the good of the people at large. Solus populi seprema est lex. The good of the people is, and ought to be, the grand object of attention in government. Good and evil are now before us; and we may chuse which we please. If it is good that the people should enjoy their liberties, we shall chuse that the States shall possess and enjoy such privileges as that the people will be secure of their rights and liberties. If it is not good that the people should enjoy their liberties, then we shall chuse that Congress shall divide their empire, and tell their different districts, or provinces, what they shall do from time to time. In this latter case, if the people are easy it is well—if the people are not easy, it is as well: for it will be a matter of indifferency to Congress whether they are easy, or not. My brethren have, therefore, to guard their rights: and Americans will never shamefully neglect them. Notwithstanding the above, Mr. Printer, I think the Constitution proposed incomparably good, provided it be properly guarded by a FEDERAL BILL of RIGHTS: for it matters not what it may contain, provided the federal Bill of Rights be explicit:—nay, it would be a benefit if the proposed Constitution should be capable of being construed into a sense that might militate with the federal Bill of Rights, provided its most natural and most easy sense should accord with such a bill: for in such a case any sinister designs of Congress would be more easily detected; and States, or Conventions of the people, would the more easily counteract them. Whether the federal House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment, or whether other bodies may impeach, is yet [392]to be determined. An Hutchinson, &c. have been impeached by the once province of the Massachusetts-Bay.1 Guard your Rights, Americans!"
Newspaper,No,Candidus,,Independent Chronicle,,12/6/1787,"Mess’rs. Adams & Nourse,1 The Constitution recommended by the Convention, is a subject of the greatest importance, to every individual of these States; and ought to be seriously considered. The respectability [393]of the characters who composed that Assembly, without doubt, will have its due weight; yet it cannot be supposed, that the citizens of America, will so far rely on the abilities of those gentlemen, as to concur in their measures, while any doubts remain on their minds, respecting their salutary operations. Some leading arguments offered in favour of the Constitution, are, that our situation, is such, as renders it absolutely necessary, we should establish some Federal Plan of Government;—that the present Constitution, is the only one that can ever be adopted; and that if we reject this, the consequences will be fatal to this country. These dreadful apprehensions seem to preclude every candid enquiry on the subject: For if we must comply, without even a lisp of hesitation, it is needless to offer it to the people, for their consideration. If the authors are deified, and their works pronounced infallible, it is delivered to the people, rather for their implicit acquiescence, than for their free deliberations. It is also said, that the States have no other alternative, than to accept it in every particular, or totally to reject it. These observations, however, I conceive, are mere assertions, without evidence. The people being called on to convene, and deliberate, proves that the Convention themselves, supposed the plan was subject to amendments. Neither can we imagine, those respectable characters, would insinuate an idea so affronting, and degrading, to the Freemen of these States, as that they must submit in the gross, to the Constitution offered, notwithstanding they might have the most weighty reasons to reject some particular parts. It is further said, that anarchy and civil war, will ensue, provided we reject the proposed Constitution: This is a bugbear, raised to influence a very respectable part of the community. Can it be supposed that the people, are so savage, and void of every principle of common prudence, that they would abandon all their deliberations in Council, and rush immediately to arms? The people of these States, are too wise and considerate, to be guilty of such horrid imprudencies: They are too enlightened to decide their political controversies by the SWORD. Those persons therefore, who raise such vile suggestions, are endeavouring to effect certain purposes, by working on the tender passions of the honest and well-disposed. Some persons are for adopting the Constitution, without any farther consideration, as they say it is impossible for us to be in a worse situation than at present. Such men are fit subjects to answer any purposes whatever, and are acting a part which they cannot justify to themselves or posterity. Are not such sentiments degrading to the character of Freemen? It must be a melancholly crisis when the people are tired of guarding their liberties; and are resigned to whatever government is [394]dealt to them. If our commerce is failing, and our industrious citizens are distressed, so far from being dilatory, the more caution is required, to adopt such a plan as will remedy their complaints. Let such persons read the history of other nations, and then judge whether it is impossible that our situation should be worse. Is it presumed, that the wisdom of this people has so far forsaken them, that they are willing to accede without any examination, to a mode of government, which may affect millions of their posterity? Or is it conceived that the period has arrived when they are ready to resign every pretension to judge for themselves, and dare not scrutinize any establishments on which depend their political happiness and welfare? On the other hand, if the State Conventions do not approve of every paragraph, must the whole plan become null and void? Shall the people, after being at the trouble of choosing members to meet in Convention; and taxing themselves with the expence of their assembling, be obliged to relinquish the whole business, and throw up every prospect of succeeding in their attempts, to establish a permanent government? These suggestions I conceive are artfully introduced to mislead the people, and are calculated to operate on their fears, so far as to influence them to accede in every particular to the proposed plan, although they might wish to make some very essential alterations. Is it not the greatest absurdity to suppose, that the plan offered, cannot be amended previous to its adoption,—when it expressly provides for proposing amendments after it has begun to operate? Would it not be the height of folly, to adopt a plan entire, in expectation of altering some very essential parts at a future period? Surely the most prudent method is, to rectify all important matters, while we are assembled to deliberate on the subject, rather than to hazard the chance of feeling evils, when possibly it may be too late to remedy them? These are considerations, worthy our serious attention. Some zealots are in extacy, when they speak of the present Constitution, and think it as sacred as the Commandments delivered from Sinai. But if we recur to what gave rise to the Convention, we shall not find that any thing super-natural was expected. The plain truth of the case is, these States finding the necessity of adopting a Federal plan to regulate their commerce, promote their agriculture and manufactures, chose from each State a number of respectable characters to meet for the above purposes.—They accordingly met, and after four months deliberation, they matured the plan now offered for our consideration. No man I presume did suppose at the time of their choice, that the devised plan, whatever it might be, was to be rejected or approved in every [395]particular. The principal design at first was, to bring forward some preliminary articles, by which the people might know the general disposition of the States; and from thence they would be able to judge, how far it was probable a Federal system could be adopted. The Constitution now offered is the outline of a plan, which probably might be agreed on with certain amendments by the whole confederacy. This knowledge of the inclination of the several States, is as much as we could rationally have expected at the first meeting of the Convention. Those persons who are in such great haste to adopt the present plan, should consider that even the smallest treaties and most common business of legislation require many overtures before they are accomplished. Certainly then so great an undertaking as the Federal Constitution of thirteen Independent Sovereign States, so various in their interests, cannot be compleated without the greatest caution and deliberation. We should not be so greatly impatient if we considered this important truth, that on the wise establishment of a Federal plan, the liberties we have so dearly purchased, wholly depend. The grand question therefore now is, what objections have we to the system offered? The State Conventions when they assemble, without doubt will keep the original plan, as entire as possible. It is not supposed, that they will object to any matters, but such as they conceive are destructive to the liberties of the people. Provided objections are made, “that a bill of rights is wanted: That the liberty of the press is not fully secured: That the powers of Congress to raise armies, lay impost, excise and direct taxation, are too great and dangerous: That the representation is inadequate: That the executive is vested with too extensive authority, and may tend to despotism: That the Legislatures of the several States would in time be annihilated: That the Congressional body would become independent of their constituents, by being paid out of the public treasury: That the choice of President by a detached body of electors was dangerous and tending to bribery; or if it is conceived that the States ought to confederate for the purposes of commerce and amity, rather than for those of legislation and taxation.[”] If after a mature and candid examination the State Conventions should consider the foregoing objections of the highest importance, without doubt they would propose, that such particulars should be erased, and amendments inserted. The State Conventions in case any alterations are required, have it in their power to choose delegates to meet again in Continental Convention. The objections (if any) of the several States would then be fully known, and after examining the sentiments of the whole, some plan it is probable would be devised, that would meet the approbation of the confederacy. As the people are now convinced (even more than [396]when the late Convention was chosen) of the necessity of adopting some permanent federal Constitution. Many people are sanguine for the Constitution, because they apprehend our commerce will be benefited. I would advise those persons to distinguish between the evils that arise from extraneous causes and our private imprudencies, and those that arise from our government. It does not appear that the embarrassments of our trade will be removed by the adoption of this Constitution. The powers of Europe do not lay any extraordinary duties on our oil, fish or tobacco, because of our government; neither do they discourage our ship building on this account. I would ask what motive would induce Britain to repeal the duties on our oil, or France on our fish, if we should adopt the proposed Constitution?2 Those nations laid these duties to promote their own fishery, &c. and let us adopt what mode of government we please, they will pursue their own politicks respecting our imports and exports, unless we can check them by some commercial regulations. But it may be said, that such commercial regulations will take place after we have adopted the Constitution, and that the northern States would then become carriers for the Southern. The great question then is, whether it is necessary in order to obtain these purposes, for every State to give up their whole power of legislation and taxation, and become an unweildy republick, when it is probable the important object of our commerce could be effected by a uniform navigation act, and giving Congress full power to regulate the whole commerce of the States? This power, Congress have often said was sufficient to answer all their purposes. The circular letter from the Boston merchants and others, was urgent on this subject. Also the navigation act of this State,3 was adopted upon similar principles, and which was declared by our Minister in England, to be the most effectual plan to promote our navigation, provided it had been adopted by the whole confederacy.4 But it may be said, this regulation of commerce, without energy to enforce a compliance is quite ideal: coertion with some persons seems the principal object, but I believe we have more to expect from the affections of the people, than from an armed body of men. Provided an uniform commercial system was adopted, and each State felt its agreeable operations, we should have but little occasion to exercise force. But however, as power is thought necessary to raise an army, if required, to carry into effect any Federal measure, I am willing to place it, where it is likely to be used with the utmost caution. This power I am willing to place among the confederated States, to be exercised when two thirds of them in their Legislative capacities shall say the common good requires [397]it. But to trust this power in the hands of a few men delegated for two, four and six years, is complimenting the ambition of human nature too highly, to risque the tranquility of these States on their absolute determination. Certain characters now on the stage, we have reason to venerate, but though this country is now blessed with a Washington, Franklin, Hancock and Adams, yet posterity may have reason to rue the day when their political welfare depends on the decision of men who may fill the places of these worthies. In considering the proposed Constitution, it is very necessary to distinguish what may give an undue influence to a particular profession and what ought to be adopted for national purposes. This party-influence is very evident in the powers vested in the Supreme Judicial. These powers extending “between citizens of different States,” also “between citizens of a State, and citizens of foreign States,” will I apprehend occasion innumerable judicial controversies; and the people will become exposed to the most expensive law suits; as almost every cause (even those originally between citizens of the same State) may be so contrived as to be carried to this Federal court. A poor man may be harrassed by tedious and expensive appeals to this Supreme Court, or “such inferiour Courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” The question then on this subject is, whether the judicial power ought to extend to any other than national matters, such as “treaties,” &c. And whether the Judicial Courts of the several States are not competent, to decide as usual on the controversies of the individuals of the several States? It is said, that the parties by this establishment, may appeal to a disinterested Federal Court, which will secure to them a fair trial, and an impartial judgment. But this mode of reasoning is calculated to mislead, by a false insinuation, rather than to prevent any evils which at present exist. The equity of our State Judicial Courts, has never been a subject of complaint. Why then should we give up these State trials, and suffer ourselves to be harrassed by a long and expensive appeal to a Continental Supreme Judicial Court? Would not such appeals serve to give every advantage to the rich over the poor? The tradesman, mechanic, and farmer, would by this establishment, be exposed to every imposition from the wealthy; as the former could not spare the time, and defray the expence of prosecuting their legal claims, distant from home. This mode also gives every advantage to British and other foreign creditors to embarrass the American merchant by appeals to this Court. Upon the whole, we are too apt to charge those misfortunes to the want of energy in our government, which we have brought upon ourselves by dissipation and extravagance; and we are led to flatter ourselves, that the proposed Constitution will restore to us peace and happiness, notwithstanding we should neglect to acquire these blessings by industry and frugality.—I will venture to affirm, that the extravagance of our British importations,—the discouragement of our own manufactures, and the luxurious living of all ranks and degrees, have been the principal cause of all the evils we now experience; and a general reform in these particulars, would have a greater tendency to promote the welfare of these States, than any measures that could be adopted.—No government under heaven could have preserved a people from ruin, or kept their commerce from declining, when they were exhausting their valuable resources in paying for superfluities, and running themselves in debt to foreigners, and to each other for articles of folly and dissipation:—While this is the case, we may contend about forms of government, but no establishment will enrich a people, who wantonly spend beyond their income. The foregoing observations are intended solely to guard us against the artful suggestions of partizans on either side, and to remove every undue biass, while we are deliberating on this important subject.—I cannot but console myself, that some measures will be adopted by the several States, to promote the great purposes of agriculture, trade and manufactures; and provided the plan now offered should not be wholly accepted, it is presumed the wisdom of the States will not suffer the materials to be thrown away; but will carefully select the choicest, and on the basis of PUBLIC CONFIDENCE establish some Federal system, that will not be dissolved till the consummation of all things."
Letter,No,John Quincy Adams,William Cranch,,,12/8/1787,"Your answers to the objections which in my last letter I started against the proposed form of Government, are ingenious and plausible yet I readily confess they have not convinced me: I will state the reasons which induce me to adhere to my former opinion, and wish you to reply; after which we shall have gone through a regular forensic, and then we may drop the subject, which will soon be discussed by the proper judges. You say in answer to the objection to § 2 of Article 1. that we must make allowances for the local prejudices of the different gentlemen who framed the Constitution, and consider biennial elections, as a medium between those in the different state Constitutions. But I conceive the state constitutions are nothing to the purpose. The only question to be answered is, whether annual or biennial elections are the best. Now I conceive they ought to be annual for the security of the people. [401]You argue that upon my principle the representatives ought to be chosen weekly; but may I not retort, and say that upon your’s they ought to be chosen for the longest possible term, to wit, for life? you allow the objection, to the inability of the people to recall their representatives, but quere—who would recall them? The people you say, (and you say truly) could not do it, and it would therefore be a right without a Remedy, this answer, I think rather fortifies than refutes my objection for, I contend that no government ought ever to be established, in this country which should deprive the people of this right, by rendering the remedy impracticable. You say “perhaps the Congress intend to pay our debts from the continental treasury.” but pray upon what foundation do you ground this conjecture? you cannot surely think that the present Congress will pay the state debts, since they cannot get money to pay the continental one. nor can you suppose that a Congress which is not yet in esse, intend any thing. I imagine therefore, you mean that the future Congress will perhaps pay these debts, but I ask whether such a conjecture is any security for the creditors of the States? do you usually find either an individual or a body of men, so eager to pay debts, which they are under no obligation to discharge? if you can name instances I will then admit the weight of the argument.—As to the powers granted to the Congress I objected to them only as they were indefinite; but I am more and more convinced, that a continental government, is incompatible with the liberties of the people. “The plan of three orders,” you say, “in government is consistent with my father’s Idea of a perfect government.” very true, but he does not say that such a government is practicable, for the whole continent, he does not even canvass the subject, but from what he says, I think it may easily be inferred that he would think such a government fatal to our liberties. But I am far from being convinced that upon the proposed project, the three orders would exist; it appears to me, that there would in fact be no proper representation of the people, and consequently no democratical branch of the constitution. It is impossible that eight men should represent the people of this Commonwealth.2 They will infallibly be chosen from the aristocratic part of the community, and the dignity, as well as the power of the people must soon dwindle to nothing.—Blackstone Vol. 1. p. 159. supposes it necessary that the commons should be chosen, “by minute, and separate districts; wherein all the voters, are, or easily may be distinguished.”3 Now if this Commonwealth be divided into eight districts, each of which shall elect one person will any one of these districts be minute? I wish if you have time you would again peruse the defence of the constitutions; it appears to me, there is scarcely a page in the book, which does not contain something that is [402]applicable against this proposed plan: see particularly the 54th. Letter; one passage of which I will quote because it is very much to the purpose. “The liberty of the people depends entirely on the constant and direct communication between them and the legislature, by means of their representatives.”4 Now in this case, there could not possibly be any such communication; and this you yourself admit when you prove the inability of the people to recall their representatives even if the right should be given them. You are mistaken I believe when you say the jealousy of the people is considered as an error on the right side It is said “the caution of the people is much to be applauded;” and it is not usual to applaud an error, even if it be on the right side. As to the 13th. article [of the Articles of Confederation] you ask whether it was not made by a majority of the people? if you enquire for information I can answer no. it was made by the whole people The confederation did not take place till all the states had acceded to it; Maryland delayed the matter I think as much as two years longer than any of the other States, so that the confederation which was made in July 1778 was not ratified till March 1781. and thus upon your own argument, I say, that what was made by the whole, can with propriety be altered only by the whole. In short, I must confess I am still of opinion that if this constitution is adopted, we shall go the way of all the world: we shall in a short time slide into an aspiring aristocracy, and finally tumble into an absolute monarchy, or else split into twenty seperate and distinct nations perpetually at war with one another; which god forbid!"

Newspaper,No,Cornelius,,Hampshire Chronicle,,12/11/1787,"Great, and perhaps, just encomiums, are, in the publick prints, and in private circles, daily bestowed on the constitution reported by the late Federal Convention. Not the least objection, that I recollect, has publickly appeared against it. Among those in particular, who are reputed wise and discerning, almost every one seems eager to embrace it. This being the case, it will undoubtedly be considered by many, as discovering a want of modesty in any one, who may presume to express a doubt of the expediency and happy consequences of adopting the constitution. As truth will bear the light; and by how much the more close examination it undergoes, by so much the more ravishing beauty it will shine; there can be no danger in hinting at some of the objections that arise against this form of government, in the mind of one, who feels for his own safety—who has never learned to see with eyes, other than his own, and who, at the same time, wishes the happiness of his fellow men, so far at least, as that of his own is included. Power has not commonly been suffered to lie down dormant, and to rust in the hands of its possessors, for want of use. It may well be presumed that men, whether individuals, or publick bodies, will generally exercise as much power as they are legally vested with, and as much to their own private advantage as they have a constitutional right to do.—With this general idea in view, let us attend to the Constitution, and soberly consider some of the consequences that will probably follow, if it should be adopted by the United States. It may be observed in the first place, that this constitution is not an amendment of the confederation, in the manner therein stipulated; but it is an in tire subversion of that solemn compact.—By the 13th article of that compact, the faith of the United States is solemnly plighted to each and every State, that “the articles of this confederation [411]shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.” By the 7th article of the constitution, it is ordained, that “the ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same.”2 Will not the adoption of this constitution in the manner here prescribed, be justly considered as a perfidious violation of that fundamental and solemn compact, by which the United States hold an existence, and claim to be a people? If a nation may so easily discharge itself from obligations to abide by its most solemn and fundamental compacts, may it not, with still greater ease, do the same in matters of less importance? And if nations may set the example, may not particular States, citizens, and subjects, follow? What then will become of publick and private faith? Where is the ground of allegiance that is due to government? Are not the bonds of civil society dissolved? Or is allegiance founded only in power? Has moral obligation no place in civil government? In mutual compacts, can one party be bound while the other is free? Or, can one party disannul such compact, without the consent of the other? If so, constitutions and national compacts are, I conceive, of no avail; and oaths of allegiance must be preposterous things. By this constitution, the legislative powers are vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. The latter are to be chosen for two years, and the former for six. It has been a generally received maxim, that frequent and free elections are the greatest security against corruption in government, and the oppression of the people. Have the United States, hitherto, suffered any inconvenience from annual elections? Have their delegates been too often shifted, or too frequently recalled? This, I believe, will not be pretended. When once the Senators and Representatives are elected, they are under no constitutional check or controul from their constituents, either by instructions, being liable to be recalled, or otherwise. It is not in the power of the citizens or the legislature of any particular State, nor of all the citizens and legislatures of all the States, either to give any legal instructions to a single member of Congress, or to call him to account for any part of his conduct relative to the trust reposed in him. He may be impeached by the House of Representatives, provided he conducts in a manner that is offensive to them; but he cannot be [412]convicted in any case, without the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators present. The Congress are to have power to levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, at their discretion; and out of this revenue, to make themselves such compensation for their services as they may think proper. Is it altogether certain, that a body of men elected for so long a term,—rendered thus independent, and most of them placed at the distance of some hundreds of miles from their constituents, will pay a more faithful regard to their interest, and set an example of economy, more becoming the circumstances of this country, than they would do, if they were annually elected, subject to some kind of instructions, and liable to be recalled, in case of male administration? Have the several states, in the estimation of the compilers of this Constitution, been hitherto, so parsimonious and unjust in paying their delegates, that they have rendered themselves unfit to contract with their Senators and Representatives, respecting a compensation for their service? If so, what may we suppose will be considered as a just compensation, when this honourable Body shall set their own pay, and be accountable to none but themselves?"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/11/1787,"To the PEOPLE. In the course of inquiry it has appeared, that for the purposes of internal regulation and domestick tranquillity, our small and separate [407]governments are not only admirably suited in theory, but have been remarkably successful in practice. It is also found, that the direct tendency of the proposed system, is to consolidate the whole empire into one mass, and, like the tyrant’s bed, to reduce all to one standard.2 Though this idea has been started in different parts of the continent, and is the most important trait of this draft, the reasoning ought to be extensively understood. I therefore hope to be indulged in a particular statement of it. Causes of all kinds, between citizens of different states, are to be tried before a continental court. This court is not bound to try it according to the local laws where the controversies happen; for in that case it may as well be tried in a state court. The rule which is to govern the new courts, must, therefore, be made by the court itself, or by its employers, the Congress. If by the former, the legislative and judicial departments will be blended; and if by the Congress, though these departments will be kept separate, still the power of legislation departs from the state in all those cases. The Congress, therefore, have the right to make rules for trying all kinds of questions relating to property between citizens of different states. The sixth article of the new constitution provides, that the continental laws shall be the supreme law of the land, and all judges in the separate states shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. All the state officers are also bound by oath to support this constitution. These provisions cannot be understood otherwise than as binding the state judges and other officers, to execute the continental laws in their own proper departments within the state. For all questions, other than those between citizens of the same state, are at once put within the jurisdiction of the continental courts. As no authority remains to the state judges, but to decide questions between citizens of the same state, and those judges are to be bound by the laws of Congress, it clearly follows, that all questions between citizens of the same state are to be decided by the general laws and not by the local ones. Authority is also given to the continental courts, to try all causes between a state and its own citizens. A question of property between these parties rarely occurs. But if such questions were more frequent than they are, the proper process is not to sue the state before an higher authority; but to apply to the supreme authority of the state, by way of petition. This is the universal practice of all states, and any other mode of redress destroys the sovereignty of the state over its own subjects. The only case of the kind in which the state would probably be sued, would be upon the state notes. The endless confusion that would [408]arise from making the estates of individuals answerable, must be obvious to every one. There is another sense in which the clause relating to causes between the state and individuals is to be understood, and it is more probable than the other, as it will be eternal in its duration, and increasing in its extent. This is the whole branch of the law relating to criminal prosecutions. In all such cases, the state is plaintiff, and the person accused is defendant. The process, therefore, will be, for the attorney-general of the state to commence his suit before a continental court. Considering the state as a party, the cause must be tried in another, and all the expense of transporting witnesses incurred. The individual is to take his trial among strangers, friendless and unsupported, without its being known whether he is habitually a good or a bad man; and consequently with one essential circumstance wanting by which to determine whether the action was performed maliciously or accidentally. All these inconveniences are avoided by the present important restriction, that the cause shall be tried by a jury of the vicinity, and tried in the county where the offence was committed. But by the proposed derangement, I can call it by no softer name, a man must be ruined to prove his innocence. This is far from being a forced construction of the proposed form. The words appear to me not intelligible, upon the idea that it is to be a system of government, unless the construction now given, both for civil and criminal processes, be admitted. I do not say that it is intended that all these changes should take place within one year, but they probably will in the course of half a dozen years, if this system is adopted. In the mean time we shall be subject to all the horrors of a divided sovereignty, not knowing whether to obey the Congress or the state. We shall find it impossible to please two masters. In such a state frequent broils will ensue. Advantage will be taken of a popular commotion, and even the venerable forms of the state be done away, while the new system will be enforced in its utmost rigour, by an army. I am the more apprehensive of a standing army, on account of a clause in the new constitution which empowers Congress to keep one at all times; but this constitution is evidently such that it cannot stand any considerable time without an army. Upon this principle one is very wisely provided. Our present government knows of no such thing."
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/14/1787,"To the PRINTER of the MASSACHUSETTS GAZETTE. Sir, The artful and the ambitious frequently defeat their own projects by the injudicious methods they incautiously adopt to enforce their designs. This only can account for the mistaken policy which ushered to the publick eye the puerile speech published in the papers of last week. Tenderness to the infirmities of age, should have suppressed it, or a respect to the former character of the patriot and the philosopher, should have left it concealed beneath the roof where the liberties of America have been relinquished, under the disgraceful idea that mankind are incapable of being governed, but by the strong hand of aristocratick, or despotick authority. This candid motive would have forbid any observations from your correspondent, did not the welfare of thousands require an antidote to the insinuations of those who are forging domestick shackles for a country just emancipated from foreign dominion. I would therefore beg leave to observe, that it is beneath the dignity of a statesman to consent to a constitution he confessedly dislikes, and to recommend a mode of government that may last for ages, and involve one quarter of the globe—because it is his opinion that no future convention may have abilities and integrity to hit on a better system. It is not at all strange, that the doubting Doctor, who has been remarkable for scepticism from fourteen to four score, should, at that advanced period, express his doubts of the propriety of lending his signature to a system he seems to intimate will finally terminate in despotism. Nor is it surprising, that when the body is debilitated, and the mind worn out, in philosophical, theological and political researches, that the enfeebled sage should wish to rid himself of the trouble of thinking deeply on the fatal consequences of the assumed powers and bold designs of the system makers in Philadelphia. It might well be expected that he should stand trembling with apprehension for the rights of a country he has pretended to love—and that a group of ideas from the anticipation of a continent manacled by power, supported by standing armies, restless under deception, and rolling in blood, to break the newly fabricated chains, should involve his language in confusion and doubt, inconsistencies and absurdity. And the painful [377]dilemma into which the aged delegate appears to be thrown, but confirms the propriety of receding from the world before the humiliating period arrives, when a second childhood has weakened all the energetick principles of manhood. Nor will the pleasant interlude between two sisters of France,22 nor the infant tear23 which accompanied his feelings of compassion, attone for the attempts to sanction, by his venerable name, a scheme that even the weakness of old age discovers to be very faulty, and acknowledges that he agrees to it with all its faults, because he doubts of his own judgment—doubts of the capacity of his accommodating brethren to do better—and doubts if he may not live to approve it hereafter. Doctor Price observes, in his essay on the importance of the American revolution, that [“]the United States are now setting out; and all depends on the care and foresight with which a plan is begun, which hereafter will require only to be strengthened and ripened. But that in America abuses have not gained sacredness by time—that there the way is open to social dignity and happiness—and reason may utter her voice with confidence and success—But that there is danger a society so happy will not be of long duration—that simplicity and virtue, will give way to depravity—that equallity will in time, be lost—the cursed lust of domineering shew itself—liberty languish—and civil government gradually degenerate into an instrument in the hands of a few to oppress and plunder the many.”24 I leave these extracts, from so celebrated a character, to the consideration of those who mistakenly think they are promoting the federal union of America; and are pushing the adoption of recent measures with a degree of infatuation they may hereafter repent."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/14/1787,"To the PEOPLE. To prevent any mistakes, or misapprehensions of the argument, stated in my last paper,2 to prove that the proposed constitution is an [427]actual consolidation of the separate states into one extensive commonwealth, the reader is desired to observe, that in the course of the argument, the new plan is considered as an intire system. It is not dependent on any other book for an explanation, and contains no references to any other book. All the defences of it, therefore, so far as they are drawn from the state constitutions, or from maxims of the common law, are foreign to the purpose. It is only by comparing the different parts of it together, that the meaning of the whole is to be understood. For instance— We find in it, that there is to be a legislative assembly, with authority to constitute courts for the trial of all kinds of civil causes, between citizens of different states. The right to appoint such courts necessarily involves in it the right of defining their powers, and determining the rules by which their judgment shall be regulated; and the grant of the former of those rights is nugatory without the latter. It is vain to tell us, that a maxim of common law requires contracts to be determined by the law existing where the contract was made: for it is also a maxim, that the legislature has a right to alter the common law. Such a power forms an essential part of legislation. Here, then, a declaration of rights is of inestimable value. It contains those principles which the government never can invade without an open violation of the compact between them and the citizens. Such a declaration ought to have come to the new constitution in favour of the legislative rights of the several states, by which their sovereignty over their own citizens within the state should be secured. Without such an express declaration the states are annihilated in reality upon receiving this constitution—the forms will be preserved only during the pleasure of Congress. The idea of consolidation is further kept up in the right given to regulate trade. Though this power under certain limitations would be a proper one for the department of Congress; it is in this system carried much too far, and much farther than is necessary. This is, without exception, the most commercial state upon the continent. Our extensive coasts, cold climate, small estates, and equality of rights, with a variety of subordinate and concurring circumstances, place us in this respect at the head of the union. We must, therefore, be indulged if a point which so nearly relates to our welfare be rigidly examined. The new constitution not only prohibits vessels, bound from one state to another, from paying any duties, but even from entering and clearing. The only use of such a regulation is, to keep each state in complete ignorance of its own resources. It certainly is no hardship to enter and clear at the custom-house, and the expense is too small to be an object. The unlimitted right to regulate trade, includes the right of granting exclusive charters. This, in all old countries, is considered as one principle branch of prerogative. We find hardly a country in Europe which has not felt the ill effects of such a power. Holland has carried the exercise of it farther than any other state; and the reason why that country has felt less evil from it is, that the territory is very small, and they have drawn large revenues from their colonies in the East and West Indies. In this respect, the whole country is to be considered as a trading company, having exclusive privileges. The colonies are large in proportion to the parent state; so that, upon the whole, the latter may gain by such a system. We are also to take into consideration the industry which the genius of a free government inspires. But in the British islands all these circumstances together have not prevented them from being injured by the monopolies created there. Individuals have been enriched, but the country at large has been hurt. Some valuable branches of trade being granted to companies, who transact their business in London, that city is, perhaps, the place of the greatest trade in the world. But Ireland, under such influence, suffers exceedingly, and is impoverished; and Scotland is a mere bye-word. Bristol, the second city in England, ranks not much above this town in population. These things must be accounted for by the incorporation of trading companies; and if they are felt so severely in countries of small extent, they will operate with ten-fold severity upon us, who inhabit an immense tract; and living towards one extreme of an extensive empire, shall feel the evil, without retaining that influence in government, which may enable us to procure redress. There ought, then, to have been inserted a restraining clause, which might prevent the Congress from making any such grant, because they consequentially defeat the trade of the out-ports, and are also injurious to the general commerce, by enhancing prices, and destroying that rivalship which is the great stimulous to industry."
Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,12/17/1787,"From a Correspondent. The New Constitution was submitted to the PEOPLE to be CONSIDERED; and it has, indeed, undergone some Disquisition, tho’ by no means equal to what its importance entitles it to receive. It would have been very extraordinary, that a System of National Government, confessedly designed for myriads yet unborn, and extending, under its immediate operation, from the Missis[s]ippi to St. Croix, should have been less examined than a Bye-Law made by a town-meeting to regulate its internal police; and yet, if the pretended friends of the People could have had their way in conducting this all-important concern, this, undoubtedly, would have been the case."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/18/1787,"To the PEOPLE. There cannot be a doubt, that, while the trade of this continent remains free, the activity of our countrymen will secure their full share. All the estimates for the present year, let them be made by what party they may, suppose the balance of trade to be largely in our favour. The credit of our merchants is, therefore, fully established in foreign countries. This is a sufficient proof, that when business is unshackled, it will find out that channel which is most friendly to its course. We ought, therefore, to be exceedingly cautious about diverting or restraining it. Every day produces fresh proofs, that people, under the immediate pressure of difficulties, do not, at first glance, discover the proper relief. The last year, a desire to get rid of embarrassments induced many honest people to agree to a tender-act, and many others, of a different description, to obstruct the courts of justice. Both these methods only increased the evil they were intended to cure. Experience has since shewn, that, instead of trying to lessen an evil by altering the present course of things, that every endeavour should have been applied to facilitate the course of law, and thus to encourage a mutual confidence among the citizens, which increases the resources of them all, and renders easy the payment of debts. By this means one does not grow rich at the expense of another, but all are benefited. The case is the same with the states. Pennsylvania, with one port and a large territory, is less favourably situated for trade than the Massachusetts, which has an extensive coast in proportion to its limits of jurisdiction. Accordingly a much larger proportion of our people are engaged in maritime affairs. We ought therefore to be particularly attentive to securing so great an [484]interest. It is vain to tell us, that we ought to overlook local interest. It is only by protecting local concerns, that the interest of the whole is preserved. No man when he enters into society, does it from a view to promote the good of others, but he does it for his own good. All men having the same view, are bound equally to promote the welfare of the whole. To recur then to such a principle as that local interests must be disregarded, is requiring of one man to do more than another, and is subverting the foundation of a free government. The Philadelphians would be shocked with a proposition to place the seat of general government and the unlimited right to regulate trade in the Massachusetts. There can be no greater reason for our surrendering the preference to them. Such sacrifices, however we may delude ourselves with the form of words, always originate in folly, and not in generosity. Let me now request your attention a little while to the actual state of Publick credit, that we may see, whether it has not been as much misrepresented as the state of our trade. A the beginning of the present year, the whole continental debt was about twelve millions of pounds in our money. About one quarter part of this sum was due to our foreign creditors. Of these France was the principal, and called for the arrears of interest. A new loan of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds was negotiated in Holland, at five per cent, to pay the arrears due to France.2 At first sight this has the appearance of bad economy, and has been used for the villainous purpose of disaffecting the people. But in the course of this same year, Congress have negotiated the sale of as much of their western lands on the Ohio and Missis[s]ippi, as amount nearly to the whole sum of the foreign debt;3 and instead of a dead loss by borrowing money at five per cent, to the amount of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds, in one sum, they make a saving of the interest at six per cent. on three millions of their domestick debt, which is an annual saving of an hundred and eighty thousand pounds. It is easy to see how such an immense fund as the western territory may be applied to the payment of the foreign debt. Purchasers of the land would as willingly procure any kind of the produce of the United States as they would buy loan-office certificates to pay for the land. The produce thus procured would easily be negotiated for the benefit of our foreign creditors. I do not mean to insinuate that no other provision should be made for our creditors, but only to shew that our credit is not so bad in other countries as has been represented, and that our resources are fully equal to the pressure. The perfection of government depends on the equality of its operation, as far as human affairs will admit, upon all parts of the empire, [485]and upon all the citizens. Some inequalities indeed will necessarily take place. One man will be obliged to travel a few miles further than another man to procure justice. But when he has travelled, the poor man ought to have the same measure of justice as the rich one. Small inequalities may be easily compensated. There ought, however, to be no inequality in the law itself, and the government ought to have the same authority in one place as in another. Evident as this truth is, the most plausible argument in favour of the new plan is drawn from the inequality of its operation in different states. In Connecticut, they have been told that the bulk of the revenue will be raised by impost and excise, and therefore they need not be afraid to trust Congress with the power of levying a dry tax at pleasure. New-York, and Massachusetts are both more commercial states than Connecticut. The latter, therefore, hopes that the other two will pay the bulk of the continental expense. The argument is in itself delusive. If the trade is not overtaxed, the consumer pays it. If the trade is over-taxed, it languishes, and by the ruin of trade the farmer loses his market. The farmer has in truth no other advantage from imposts than that they save him the trouble of collecting money for the government. He neither gets or loses money by changing the mode of taxation. The government indeed finds it the easiest way to raise the revenue; and the reason is that the tax is by this means collected where the money circulates most freely. But if the argument was not delusive, it ought to conclude against the plan, because it would prove the unequal operation of it, and if any saving is to be made by the mode of taxing, the saving should be applied towards our own debt, and not to the payment of that part of the continental burden which Connecticut ought to discharge. It would be impossible to refute in writing all the delusions made use of to force this system through. Those respecting the publick debt, and the benefit of imposts, are the most important, and these I have taken pains to explain. In one instance indeed, the impost does raise money at the direct expense of the seaports. This is when goods are imported subject to a duty, and re-exported without a drawback. Whatever benefit is derived from this source, surely should not be transferred to another state, at least till our own debts are cleared. Another instance of unequal operation is, that it establishes different degrees of authority in different states, and thus creates different interests. The lands in New-Hampshire having been formerly granted by this state, and afterwards by that state, to private persons, the whole authority of trying titles becomes vested in a continental court, and that state loses a branch of authority, which the others retain, over their own citizens. I have now gone through two parts of my argument, and have proved the efficiency of the state governments for internal regulation, and the disadvantages of the new system, at least some of the principal. The argument has been much longer than I at first apprehended, or, possibly, I should have been deterred from it. The importance of the question has, however, prevented me from relinquishing it."
Newspaper,No,Cornelius,,Hampshire Chronicle,,12/18/1787,"It will probably be urged, “Our State Legislature set their own pay; and why should not Congress do the same.” If the cases are similar, the reasoning may be good; but there is a wide difference between them. The members of our State legislature are annually elected—they are subject to instructions—they are chosen within small circles—they are sent but a small distance from their respective homes: Their conduct is constantly known to their constituents. They frequently see, and are seen, by the men whose servants they are. While attending the duties of their office, their connexions in general, are with men who have been bred to economy, and whose circumstances require them to live in a frugal style. They are absent from their respective homes but a few days, or weeks, at most. They return, and mix with their neighbours of the lowest rank, see their poverty, and feel their wants.—On the contrary: The members of Congress are to be chosen for a term of years. They are to be subject to no instructions. They are to be chosen within large circles: They will be unknown to a very considerable part of their constituents, and their constituents will be not less unknown to them. They will be far removed, and long detained, from the view of their constituents. Their general conduct will be unknown. Their chief connections will be with men of the first rank in the United States, who have been bred in affluence at least, if not in the excess of luxury. They will have constantly before them the enchanting example of Ambassadors, other [413]publick Ministers, and Consuls from foreign courts, who, both from principles of policy, and private ambition, will live in the most splendid and costly style. Men are naturally enough inclined to vie with each other. Let any body of men whatever be placed, from year to year, in circumstances like these; let them have the unlimitted controul of the property of the United States; and let them feel themselves vested, at the same time, with a constitutional right, out of this property to make themselves such compensation as they may think fit: And then, let any one judge, whether they will long retain the same ideas, and feel themselves under equal restraints, as to fixing their own pay, with the members of our state legislature. This part of the Constitution, I conceive to be calculated, not only to enhance the expense of the federal government to a degree that will be truely burdensome; but also, to increase that luxury and extravagance, in general, which threatens the ruin of the United States; and that, to which the Eastern States in particular, are wholly unequal. By this Federal Constitution, each House is to be the judge, not only of the elections, and returns, but also of the qualifications of its members; and that, without any other rule than such as they themselves may prescribe. This power in Congress, I take to be equal to that of a negative on elections in general. And the freedom of elections being taken away, where is the security or liberty that is reserved to the citizens under this federal government? But as if this were a light thing, and the liberties of the people not sufficiently cramped by their election being thus exposed to a negative, at the pleasure of each House; the Congress are also vested with the power of prescribing, not only the times and manner of holding elections for Senators; but, the times, manner and places of holding elections for Representatives. There is undoubtedly, some interesting and important design in the Congress being, by the Constitution, thus particularly vested with this discretionary power of controuling elections. Will it be urged that, as to such particular times and places for holding elections as may be most convenient for the several States, the Congress will be more competent judges than the citizens themselves, or their respective legislatures? This, surely, will not be pretended. The end then of placing this power in the hands of Congress, cannot have been, the greater convenience of the citizens who are interested and concerned in those elections. But whatever may have been the design, it is easy to see that a very interesting and important use may be made of this power; and I can conceive of but one reason why it should be vested in the Congress; particularly as it relates to the places of holding elections for Representatives. This power being vested in the Congress, may enable them, [414]from time to time, to throw the elections into such particular parts of the several States where the dispositions of the people shall appear to be the most subservient to the wishes and views of that honourable body; or, where the interests of the major part of the members may be found to lie. Should it so happen (as it probably may) that the major part of the Members of Congress should be elected in, and near the seaport towns; there would, in that case, naturally arise strong inducements for fixing the places for holding elections in such towns, or within their vicinity. This would effectually exclude the distant parts of the several States, and the bulk of the landed interest, from an equal share in that government, in which they are deeply interested. There is nothing in the Constitution that determines what shall be considered as an election of a Representative. The Representatives are to be chosen by the people; and where there are a number to be chosen, it is, perhaps, not very likely that any one gentleman will have a majority of all the votes. Those who may appear to have the greatest number of votes must, therefore be considered as being elected.—I wish there never might be any competition between the landed and mercantile interests, nor between any different classes of men whatever. Such competitors will, however, exist, so long as occasion and opportunity for it is given, and while human nature remains the same that it ever has been. The citizens in the seaport towns are numerous; they live compact; their interests are one; there is a constant connection and intercourse between them; they can, on any occasion, centre their votes where they please. This is not the case with those who are in the landed interest; they are scattered far and wide; they have but little intercourse and connection with each other. To concert uniform plans for carrying elections of this kind is intirely out of their way. Hence, their votes if given at all, will be no less scattered than are the local situations of the voters themselves. Wherever the seaport towns agree to centre their votes, there will, of course, be the greatest number. A gentleman in the country therefore, who may aspire after a seat in Congress, or who may wish for a post of profit under the federal government, must form his connections, and unite his interest with those towns. Thus, I conceive, a foundation is laid for throwing the whole power of the federal government into the hands of those who are in the mercantile interest; and for the landed, which is the great interest of this country to be unrepresented, forlorn, and without hope. It grieves me to suggest an idea of this kind: But I believe it to be important, and not the mere phantom of imagination, or the result of an uneasy and restless disposition. I am convinced of the candour and liberal disposition of gentlemen who are now in the seaport towns, and [415]the mercantile interest; and I am fully persuaded, they desire no such undue advantages over their brethren in the country, who are in the landed interest. But, let a man be king over Syria; and he may do things for which he had, before, no disposition. The Constitution is designed for time to come. The executive power is to be vested in a President of the United States, who is to hold his office during the term of four years, and who is to be commander in chief of the army and navy, and of the militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United States. He is to receive for his services, at stated times, a compensation which shall not be increased nor diminished during the term for which he is elected. This compensation must, and ought, to be suited to the dignified station in which that officer is placed, which cannot be considered as far below that of an European Monarch. Elective Monarchies, wherever they have obtained, have generally been attended with the most dreadful consequences. And I am not without fear that venality and corruption may shortly be found among some of the least calamities that will attend those elections. At no very distant period, we may expect the most violent competitions between individual aspiring men, between particular States, and between the Eastern and Southern States. When this shall take place, it will be natural to seek, and easy to find, sufficient pretences for recourse to arms. The judicial power of the United States is to be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such other Inferior Courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges of both are to hold their offices during good behaviour, and at stated times, to receive for their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.—From the great variety of cases to which this judicial power is to extend, it is apparent these courts must be numerous. And as the judges are, at stated times, to receive from the publick, a compensation for their services, this must add a very considerable sum to the expence of government. Every trifling controversy of twenty shillings, or less, between citizens of different States, must be brought, it seems, before one of these Federal Courts. The great number of publick men that must be supported on the plan of this Constitution, in addition to the governments of the particular States, must lay a burden on the citizens which there is reason to fear, will prove insupportable. The publick mind, I fear, is at this critical juncture, prepared to do the same that almost every people, who have enjoyed an excessive degree of liberty have done before;—to plunge headlong into the dreadful abyss of Despotick Government.—At the time of forming the Confederation, the publick rage was on the side of liberty. The reigning [416]disposition then was, to secure the highest degrees of liberty to the people, and to guard against every possible instance of oppression in their rulers. The consequence is, want of sufficient energy in government. We have had a surfeit of liberty; and, to many, the very name has now become nauseous. That the Congress ought to have further powers than those with which they are vested by the Confederation, no reasonable man will deny. That this is absolutely necessary, in order that the United States should continue much longer to exist, with any tolerable degree of reputation, I am fully convinced. But that the Congress, or any other body of men, should be vested with all those independent and unlimitted powers prescribed in the Constitution, appears to me, by no means necessary. Considering the principles by which publick bodies are generally influenced, I am very apprehensive, that if this Constitution is adopted, the remedy proposed will, in no very distant period of time, prove, at least equally distressing with the disease itself. The strength and energy of government does not, I conceive, so much consist in particular men, being vested with unlimitted powers, as it does in a due regulation of the necessary powers with which they are vested, and in effectual provision for the exercise of those powers. It is possible, I believe, for government to be weak in the hands of a Despot, and strong, where considerable degrees of liberty are enjoyed. We have practised but a few years on the Confederation; long enough however, to discover its principle defects. The great embarrassments under which we have laboured, are found, I imagine, to have risen from the want of a revenue, and a general regulation of trade. If Congress (continuing in all other respects, to possess the same powers which they do at present) were vested with the further power of laying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, and with the exclusive right of regulating Commerce, I believe our federal government would be as firm and happy as might reasonably be expected to fall to the lot of humanity, in this state of imperfection. If it is indeed necessary that we should have a President, vested with the powers prescribed in the Constitution, I am fully persuaded that rather than that he should be elected in the manner therein described, and for the term limitted, it would be attended with consequences less pernicious, at once, to make the office hereditary, and during life. This would, at least, prevent that rivalship, venality, corruption, and tumult, which may be expected, sooner or later, to attend those elections. If it is further necessary, that a Judicial Court should be constituted, whose powers shall extend to certain cases of national importance; this, [417]I apprehend, may be done with equal advantage, and less inconvenience, without multiplying those courts in the manner which the Constitution prescribes. In the case of direct taxation, the rule of apportionment among the several States, I take to be very unequal, and in its operation, will prove exceedingly injurious to the Eastern States. These States, compared with the Southern, have always abounded in people more than in wealth; and from the nature of their climate and soil, will forever continue to do the same. Yet, by this rule of apportionment, a great allowance is made in favour of the Southern States: Three free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, being reckoned equal to five slaves. In the Eastern States there are but few slaves. In Massachusetts, there are none. There are in that State, a large number of negroes; and in apportioning the taxes, three of these negroes are to be reckoned equal to five in the Southern States. When I consider the independent situation in which the members of Congress are placed,—the sovereign right of countrouling elections, which that honourable body are to possess,—the discretionary, and unlimited power, vested in each House, to judge of the qualifications of its members; and that by such rules only as they themselves may prescribe, and alter as they please,—the unbridled temptations that will be constantly before them to aggrandize themselves, their connexions, and friends, at the expense of their constituents, and the unbounded opportunity they will have to do this: I am constrained to believe, that the principles on which the Constitution is predicated, are such as tend to a government of Men, and not of Laws. And, notwithstanding the high encomiums that are bestowed on this form of government, I shall be most disagreeably disappointed, if it does not prove, in its operation, to be one of the most unequal, arbitrary, oppressive, venal, and corrupt governments that is extant. I am sensible that the office of President of the United States is, in some respects, different from that of King of Great-Britain; and also, that the powers of the Senate are, in some measure, different from those of the House of Lords: Yet, either the one, or the other, existing in America, might be pernicious to the people. And it may be yet uncertain, whether, in every instance wherein they differ, the difference is in favour of the Federal Government.—In offices that are elective, where the elections are liable to embarrassments, or exposed to venal and corrupt influence, it may admit of some doubt, whether the man of the greatest integrity, or the man of the greatest intrigue, stands the fairest chance for preferment! Thus I have ventured, with freedom, and I hope, with candour, to express my own ideas on this interesting and important subject. I have no disposition to kindle a flame, nor to excite any groundless fears, in the minds of my fellow citizens. I most ardently wish for an efficient, firm, and permanent system of government; and at the same time, that the people at large may enjoy as much liberty and ease, as may be consistent with such a government."
Newspaper,No,Candidus,,Independent Chronicle,,12/20/1787,"“Remember, O my Friends, the Laws, the Rights, The generous plan of Power, deliver’d down From age, to age, by your renowned forefathers, So dearly bought, the price of so much Blood! O! Let them never perish in your hands, But piously transmit them to your Children.” Addison.2 In my last, I endeavoured to guard my countrymen, against the artful suggestions of many who say that the proposed Constitution is the only one that can be adopted: that we must receive it without any amendments: and that anarchy and civil war, will be the consequences of rejecting it.—The two former pleas, I contended was derogatory to freemen, and the latter affronting to our understanding. I need not urge my countrymen, to a serious consideration of the important business before them; presuming that the wisdom and prudence which have ever been the characteristic of Americans, will lead the members of the convention to consider maturely, before they decide on so momentous a question. Many arguments have been offered to the public, both for, and against the new Constitution; on one side we have the rapturous strains of a Wilson, on the other the nervous reasoning of Brutus:3—But the advocates for the Constitution, have always assumed an advantage by saying, that their opposers have never offered any plan as a substitute; the following outlines are therefore submitted, not as originating from an individual, but as copied from former resolutions of Congress, and united with some parts of the Constitution proposed by the respectable Convention. This being the case, I presume it will not be invalidated by the cant term of antifederalism, viz. 1st. That the Legislature of each State, empower Congress to frame a navigation act, to operate uniformly throughout the States; reserving to Congress all necessary powers to regulate our commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian tribes. The revenue arising [494]from the impost to be subject to their appropriations, “to enable them to fulfil their public engagements with foreign creditors.4 2d. That the Legislature of each State, instruct their delegates in Congress to frame a treaty of AMITY, for the purposes of discharging each State’s proportion of the public debt, and support of the federal government. To assist each other in cases of insurrections and invasion: and in case any State within the confederacy should be delinquent in discharging their proportion of the public debt, either foreign or domestic, to enforce (if necessary) their immediate payment. Each State obligating themselves in the treaty of amity, to furnish (whenever required by Congress) a proportionate number of the Militia, who are ever to be well organized and disciplined, for the purposes of repelling any invasion; suppressing any insurrection; or reducing any delinquent State within the confederacy, to a compliance with the federal treaty of commerce and amity.—Such assistance to be furnished by the Supreme Executive of each State, on the application of Congress.—The troops in cases of invasion to be under the command of the Supreme Executive of the State immediately in danger; but in cases of insurrection, and when employ’d against any delinquent State in the confederacy, the troops to be under the command of Congress. 3d. That such States as did not join the confederacy of commerce and amity, should be considered as aliens; and any goods brought from such State into any of the confederated States, together with their vessels, should be subject to heavy extra duties. 4th. The treaty of amity, agreed to by the several States, should expressly declare, that no State (without the consent of Congress) should enter into any treaty, alliances or confederacy, grant, letters of marque and reprisal; make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder; expost facto law, impairing the obligations of contracts; engage in war, or declare peace. 5th. A Supreme Judicial Court to be constituted for the following federal purposes, viz. To extend to all treaties made previous to, or which shall be made under the authority of the confederacy. All cases affecting Ambassadors, and other public Ministers and Consuls; controversies between two or more States; and between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different States.—To define and punish piracies, and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of nations. 6th. That it be recommended to Congress, that the said navigation act, and treaty of amity, be sent to the Legislatures (or people) of the several States, for their assenting to, and ratifying the same.—The ratification of nine States, to be sufficient for the establishment of such a [495]navigation act, and treaty of amity, between the States, so ratifying the same. 7th. A regular statement and account of the receipt and expenditures, of all public monies, should be published from time to time. The above plan it is humbly conceived secures the internal government of the several States, promotes the commerce of the whole union; preserves a due degree of energy; lays restraints on aliens; secures the several States against invasions and insurrections, by a MILITIA, rather than a STANDING ARMY; checks all expost facto laws; cements the States by certain fœderal restrictions; confines the Judiciary powers to national matters; provides for the public information of receipts and expenditures: in a word, places us in a compleat federal state. Every man must be sensible, that a federal system, is of the utmost importance to our national prosperity.—The deranged situation of our public affairs, now calls on us to adopt such measures as will relieve the distresses of the PEOPLE, and establish upon a permanent basis the COMMERCE of these States. The encouragement of a beneficial commerce must be acknowledged, to be of the greatest public utility; as the value of our produce and our lands, must either rise or fall in proportion to the prosperous, or adverse state of trade. This essential concern, has ever claimed the particular attention of Congress; their earnest solicitations to vest them with sufficient powers for this purpose, fully evince of what importance they considered this object. Provided their requisitions had been complied with, our trade would probably have been upon a respectable footing,—and foreigners would largely have contributed to the payment of our national debt. The question now is, what public measures must be adopted to restore our decayed commerce, and give energy to government? These I presume, are the great objects to be considered: And, provided this business is earnestly undertaken, every embarrassment we now experience would subside; our public credit would revive; our government would receive every support; a circulation of currency would ensue; our taxes would be quickly collected; the husbandman, merchant and tradesman, would experience the salutary effects; and public confidence, which has long been wanting among us, would be again restored. Notwithstanding the many advocates for the adoption of the new Constitution, I cannot but doubt, whether this establishment will remedy our complaints. It is true the government of these States has been for many years in a decline; for want of a federal system, all our measures to promote the public interest have proved abortive. But in order to remedy these evils, shall we now pass to the other extreme; and, from [496]denying Congress every power whatever, wantonly surrender into their hands our Excises, and submit to their direct taxation? with powers to raise armies, &c. &c. The readiness of the people to adopt the new Constitution, arises in a great degree from the apprehension that no other mode can be adopted: But this is a mistaken idea, as Congress a few years since, pointed out a mode similar to a part of the plan now offered,—which they recommended to the several States for their adoption. <The resolves of Congress, 18th April, 1783, “recommends to the several States, to invest them with powers to levy for the use of the United States, certain duties upon goods, imported from any foreign port, island or plantation;”5 which measure is declared by them, “To be a system more free, from well founded exceptions, and is better calculated to receive the approbation of the several States, than any other, that the wisdom of Congress could devise; and if adopted, would enable them to fulfil their public engagements with their foreign creditors.”6 The address of the General Court of this Commonwealth, to the people, 30th October, 1786,7 fully evinces, that measures much short of the proposed Constitution, would restore these States to the highest degree of harmony and respectability. They say “Of the national debt, that part which is due to foreigners, must be paid in gold and silver;—if the Continental Impost, should take place, which there is much reason to expect, it would immediately discharge us from the principal of this debt; with respect to the Continental domestic debt,8 Congress have resolved that the lands ceded to them, by the individual States, shall be disposed of, for the payment of that debt; the particular debt of this Commonwealth, is almost wholle due to its citizens; considerable sums are expected from the sale of lands in the easterly part of this State.” From the above quotations, it does appear, that the Continental Impost, is fully adequate to enable Congress to fulfil their engagements with their foreign Creditors. The lands ceded to Congress, are to be disposed of, for the payment of the Continental domestic debt:(a) And the particular debt of this State, will probably, (exclusive of the Western territory) be discharged in a great measure, from the sale of the Eastern lands. If then, these three great national objects, can be accomplished, without a total surrender of the Sovereignty of these States, why should each State with such alacrity, reduce themselves to mere corporations,—and submit their Excises, with every other tax, to the unlimited controul of Congress?> This conduct in the American annals, may appear as inglorious, as King John’s resignation of the Crown, to the Pope’s Legate.9 The magnitude of the surrender is expressed most forcibly by Mr. Wilson, when [497]he says, “Thirteen Sovereign States, some of which, in territorial jurisdiction, population, and resource, equal the most respectable nations of Europe; but likewise myriads of citizens, who in future ages, shall inhabit the vast uncultivated regions of the Continent.” Certainly then, the importance of the business before us, ought to “fill our minds with awe and apprehension.”10 The creditors of the particular States, would become great sufferers, if the Excises are wholly subject to the use of Congress. The interest of the State debt must remain for many years unpaid; as the necessary arrangements of Congress; the pay of their officers; the great expences naturally attending so extensive a system of government; the parade and page[a]ntry necessary to keep up the etiquette of Dignities; together with the enormous expenditures, within the confines of the Federal town, will call for the greatest part of the money that can be for many years collected. Provided the Constitution should be adopted in all its parts, the Congressional Body, would have so many important matters to consider, that the most essential object of Commerce might not claim that particular attention, which our present situation requires. The merchant and tradesman, might be waiting with earnest expectations for some commercial regulations, while Congress were busily engaged in framing other systems of legislation. When we consider the great revenue requisite to support the proposed Constitution, we ought to reflect whether the abilities of the people are proportionate. How can the tradesman, farmer and merchant in the present feeble state of their several occupations, and employments, be able to support the immediate expences of the new Constitution? The demands on them, would be hastily made; and they must be answered, even before any beneficial operations could arise from the establishment; and after those great advances of taxes, it is quite uncertain, whether we should not be disappointed in our expectations, of the revival of our commerce. But should we adopt the plan proposed by Congress, in their resolves of the 18th April, 1783, (already mentioned) no extraordinary expences would arise, and Congress having but one object to attend, every commercial regulation would be uniformly adopted; the duties of impost and excise, would operate equally throughout the States; our shipbuilding and carrying trade, would claim their immediate attention: And in consequence thereof, our agriculture, trade and manufactures would revive and flourish. No acts of legislation, independent of this great business, would disaffect one State against the other; but the whole, uniting in one Federal System of commerce, would serve to [498]remove all local attachments, and establish our navigation upon a most extensive basis. The powers of Europe, would be alarmed at our Union, and would fear least we should retaliate on them by laying restrictions on their trade. These being the probable consequences of a commercial system, the questions are, Whether it is necessary, to adopt the Constitution proposed; or whether each State, complying with the request of Congress, together with the other parts of the plan proposed, would not answer every purpose we would wish to effect? If the latter is competent to these purposes, why should we be so urgent to adopt a plan of government, among other defects, destitute of that basis of freedom, A BILL OF RIGHTS; and which exposes every man, within these States, to be drag’ hundreds of miles, to a Federal Judicial Court?(b) The Constitution proposed, may aggrandize a few individuals: The offices of honor and profit may please the AMBITION of some, and relieve the EMBARRASSMENTS of others. It may serve to multiply Judicial controversies, and embarrass the citizens of the several States, by appeals to a Federal Court. It may give an undue influence to Congress, by the appointment of a numerous Body of officers. It may discourage Industry, by promoting an infinite train of dependants and seekers.—But the great object of commerce,—our national respectability,—together with industry and frugality, would probably be the happy consequences of a Commercial Confederation. <These States, by the blessing of Heaven, are now in a very tranquil state.—This government in particular, has produced an instance of ENERGY, in suppressing [the] late Rebellion, &c. which no absolute Monarchy can boast: And, notwithstanding the insinuations of a “small party,” who are ever branding the PEOPLE, with the most opprob[r]ious Epithets; representing them as aiming to level all distinctions; emit paper money; encourage the Rebellion: Yet the present General Court, the voice of that Body, whom they have endeavoured to stigmatize, have steadily purused measures foreign from the suggestions of such revilers. And the public credit has been constantly appreciating since the present Administration. Let us then be cautious how we disturb this general harmony. Every exertion is now making, by the people, to discharge their taxes. Industry and frugality prevail. Our commerce is every day encreasing by the enterprize of our Merchants.—And above all, the PEOPLE of the several States are convinced of the necessity of adopting some Federal Commercial Plan. May that kind Providence, which has ever conducted America through every changing scene, guide and direct the ensuing Convention to adopt such measures, as will promote the lasting happiness of these States.> (a)<The Continental domestic debt, is £. 27,000,000; Congress have already sold lands to the amount of £. 6,000,000, and about £. 11,000,000 are already collected in the different State Treasuries; so that there remains to be redeemed, not more than £. 10,000,000. (b)Supposing a merchant at the southward, should order his correspondent in Boston, to build him a vessel: The merchant after forwarding his accounts, in case of any dispute, might be carried to the Supreme Judicial Court: the ship-carpenter would be obliged to attend the trial, and probably call’d on, to carry a number of his workmen as witnesses; the expences attending their journey; the delay of the cause; neglect of business—together with numberless intervening charges, would absorb the earnings of a whole year’s labour."
Letter,Yes,John Quincy Adams,Abigail Adams,,,12/23/1787,"I have frequently been prevented from expatiating in my letters, upon political topics, by the sterility of the subject; an uncommon fertility now produces the same effect. I can only say in general terms that parties run very high, and that we are most probably at the eve of a revolution: Whether it will be effected, in silence, and without a struggle, or whether it will be carried at the point of the sword is vet a question.—The Newspapers, will show you how much the public is engaged in the discussion of the new continental form of government, which I fear will be adopted"
Newspaper,No,Poplicola,,Boston Gazette,,12/24/1787,"Messieurs EDES, Mr. McKean, says a Philadelphia paper, closed a long speech on the legislative article of the new Constitution with this striking observation: “Though a good system of government is certainly a blessing, yet it is on the administration of the best system, that the freedom, wealth and happiness of the people depend.” There is nothing, I confess, so striking to my mind in this observation—A good system of government may be, and too often is, administered by weak and corrupt men; and while this is the case, the people will suffer injury. The fault then will be not in the system, but in the administration; though many persons, when they see public affairs badly managed, are apt to ascribe it to the wrong cause; and hence they wish to change the very nature of a good Constitution; and very frequently change for the worse. The Federalists, as they call themselves (improperly in my humble opinion) seem to be aware that the plan offered by the late Convention will not endure a strict scrutiny; they wish, however, that the people would adopt it in its present form, and depend on a wise administration. But do they think the people of America, after so magnanimous and arduous a conflict for the rights of mankind, will be so improvident as to adopt a form which they may not think safe for themselves, and then posterity, because Mr. McKean thinks, as we find in another part of his speech, that even the worst government may be so administered [509]as to ensure the dignity and happiness of a nation? I presume they will not—Let us aim at a Federal Constitution, calculated to establish the Federal Union of these sovereign States, and secure the liberties of the people; and having fixed upon such a Constitution, we shall even then have enough to do, if we turn our utmost attention to the means of having it administered well. This would be acting up to the character of citizens of a free sovereign and independent State. But there is one observation made by that honorable gentleman, in the same speech, which, to me, appears striking indeed, “Despotism, (says he) if wisely administered, is the best form of government ever invented by the ingenuity of man![”] I cannot but wonder that such a sentiment should fall from the lips of Mr. McKean, who is undoubtedly a man of sense and knowledge—In the course of his studies in the law, and from his other reading, I should have thought he would have been led to a different conclusion.—Is Despotism then the offspring of human ingenuity? No. In societies of men, it springs from an intolerably haughty, and imperious temper—an insatiable lust of domination; and from servility and ignorance in multitudes of the human race, who have been flattered and coaxed to give up their unalienable rights of nature, by degrees, till the tyrant has become strong enough to invade the whole, and immerge the deluded multitude in slavery and wretchedness. For my part, I do not believe there is a man on earth, to whom it would be safe for the people to intrust the powers of a despot, whose will must be their law—I would not trust him however mild and gracious his natural temper might be. Nero, was said to be blest with a kind and affectionate heart; but the powers of a despot intoxicated his mind—He soon became wild and unruly, as the most untameable beasts of the forest—Every tender feeling was eradicated from his soul, and he was the butcher of the subjects (not citizens) of Rome in a very few years.—Fatal experience has taught the world, that despotism has proved ruinous to the dignity and happiness of men—Despots have very rarely, if ever, had wisdom, integrity and other essential qualities, to “administer” their governments “wisely;” and they have as seldom had inclination to spend a thought about it. The Supreme Being, indeed, governs the Universe by the council of his own understanding; and if all his creatures are not happy under his government, it is owing to their imperfection, or their fault. He alone is perfectly wise, powerful, and good—He leaves it to the wisdom of men to institute governments for themselves, and it must be owned that the wisest human institutions are imperfect—But it is exceedingly clear, from the government which He prescribed for his favourite people, that despotism was not His choice—They foolishly changed their free government for a monarchy, though [510]they were faithfully warned of the intolerable burdens it would bring them under, which they afterwards felt to their cost without remedy1—The pride and madness, not the ingenuity of man, invented despotism. I wish Mr. McKean would again recur to the histories of Despotic Governments, and see how many of the tyrants have treated their people with savage and brutal barbarity, to one who govern’d with a tolerable degree of mildness and wisdom: Even under the best of them, their forlorn subjects hold their property, their liberties, and lives, on no better a tenure than their sovereign pleasure—I have seen and experienced so much of the depravity and weakness of the human mind, that I hope these States will never be prevailed upon to relinquish a greater share of their powers, to the Federal Union, than is sufficient to give the government a degree of energy, adequate to the emergencies of the Union; and that while they chearfully do this, they will wisely guard those rights and powers which shall remain, and watch with republican jealousy against the least encroachment on them. Mr, McKean, after speaking of the Supreme excellency of despotism, if wisely administered, mentions absolute and limited monarchies, aristocracies, and mixed governments, and says the people under each of them “are as contented and prosperous as we are, owing, undoubtedly to the wisdom and virtue of their rulers.” Absolute monarchies and hereditary aristocracies are much the same, so far as the people whom they govern, are affected. By gazing at the splendor of a monarch, or a nobility, and being well accustomed to military tyranny, they bow to the yoke and bear it as patiently as their brother-oxen—They drag their heavy loads without repining, and will be contented, though they are cruelly whipped for their pains. Whence is this abject submission? From their ignorance.—Slavery renders them incapable, even of thinking—The means of information are kept from them, and they have not the idea that men were designed to be free, and that some communities, alas! how few! actually are free. England is a limited monarchy, and a mixed government—The people of that nation must be allowed, to be very contented’, for they have seen their nation governed by a junto—They have seen that junto purchasing parliaments to give a sanction to all their profligate measures—They have seen the junto raising and keeping a standing army in a time of profound peace: That army murdering peaceable and quiet subjects, and the murderers pardoned—And they have seen that junto employing an army and navy for the most dishonorable purpose of slave-making in America, and finally squandering away thirteen of their richest jewels! and after all they have scarcely breath’d a murmer.—God Almighty grant, that these United [511]States may never be ruled by a junto, or if they should be so unfortunate, may they not long rest contented under it!"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/25/1787,"To the PEOPLE. It has been proved, by indisputable evidence, that power is not the grand principle of union among the parts of a very extensive empire; and that when this principle is pushed beyond the degree necessary for rendering justice between man and man, it debases the character of individuals, and renders them less secure in their persons and property. Civil liberty consists in the consciousness of that security, and is best guarded by political liberty, which is the share that every citizen has in the government. Accordingly all our accounts agree, that in those empires which are commonly called despotick, and which comprehend by far the greatest part of the world, the government is most fluctuating, and property least secure. In those countries insults are borne by the sovereign, which, if offered to one of our governours, would fill us with horrour, and we should think the government dissolving. The common conclusion from this reasoning is an exceedingly unfair one, that we must then separate, and form distinct confederacies. This would be true, if there was no principle to substitute in the room of power. Fortunately there is one. This is commerce. All the states have local advantages, and in a considerable degree separate interests. They are, therefore, in a situation to supply each other’s wants. Carolina, for instance, is inhabited by planters, while the Massachusetts is more engaged in commerce and manufactures. Congress has the power of deciding their differences. The most friendly intercourse may therefore [516]be established between them. A diversity of produce, wants and interests. Produces commerce, and commerce, where there is a common, equal and moderate authority to preside, produces friendship. The same principles apply to the connection with the new settlers in the west Many supplies they want, for which they must look to the older settlements, and the greatness of their crops enables them to make payments. Here then we have a bond of union which applies to all parts of the empire, and would continue to operate if the empire comprehended all America.2 We are now, in the strictest sense of the terms, a federal republick. Each part has within its own limits the sovereignty over its citizens, while some of the general concerns are committed to Congress. The complaints of the deficiency of the Congressional powers are confined to two articles. They are not able to raise a revenue by taxation, and they have not a complete regulation of the intercourse between us and foreigners. For each of these complaints there is some foundation, but not enough to justify the clamour which has been raised. Congress, it is true, owes a debt which ought to be paid. A considerable part of it has been paid. Our share of what remains would annually amount to about sixty or seventy thousand pounds. If, therefore, Congress were put in possession of such branches of the impost as would raise this sum in our state, we should fairly be considered as having done our part towards their debt; and our remaining resources, whether arising from impost, excise, or dry tax, might be applied to the reduction of our own debt. The principal of this last amounts to about thirteen hundred thousand pounds, and the interest to between seventy or eighty thousand. This is, surely, too much property to be sacrificed; and it is as reasonable that it should be paid as the continental debt. But if the new system should be adopted, the whole impost, with an unlimited claim to excise and dry tax, will be given to Congress. There will remain no adequate fund for the state debt, and the state will still be subject to be sued on their notes.—This is, then, an article which ought to be limited. We can, without difficulty, pay as much annually as shall clear the interest of our state debt, and our share of the interest on the continental one. But if we surrender the impost, we shall still, by this new constitution, be held to pay our full proportion of the remaining debt, as if nothing had been done. The impost will not be considered as being paid by this state, but by the continent. The federalists, indeed, tell us, that the state debts will all be incorporated with the continental debt, and all paid out of one fund. In this, as in all other instances, they endeavour to support their scheme of consolidation by delusion. Not one word is said in the book3 in favour of such a scheme, and there [517]is no reason to think it true. Assurances of that, sort are easily given, and as easily forgotten. There is an interest in forgetting what is false. No man can expect town debts to be united with that of the state; and there will be as little reason to expect, that the state and continental debts will be united together."
Newspaper,No,Helvidius Priscus,,Independent Chronicle,,12/27/1787,"To the PUBLIC. Mr. Wilson observes, in his late celebrated speech, “that after a lapse of six thousand years America has now presented the first instance of a people assembled to weigh deliberately, and calmly, and to decide leisurely, and peaceably, on a form of government, by which they shall bind themselves and their posterity.” Has he not here suggested the strongest reason that can be urged, for postponing the adoption of the new system? If the assertion is true, is it prudent for this extensive Continent implicitly to accept, and rapidly and irrevocably adopt, the propositions of thirty or forty men, some of whom were infants, when the principles of the late revolution animated the patriots of this country to a noble resistance, and led them to bear the bold arm to shake the sceptre of foreign dominion: And as Mr. Wilson himself observes, [536]“Government is a science as yet in infancy; and with all its various modifications, has been the result of force, fraud or accident.”1 May not these gentlemen be considered as yet in their pupilage, with regard to the origin, the end, and the most perfect mode of civil government? It is also well known, that some of the late; Convention were the professed advocates of the British system; that others stood suspended in equilibrio, uncertain on which side to declare, until the scale of fortune balanced in favour of America; that the political manœuvres of some of them have always sunk in the vortex of private; interest, and that the immense wealth of others has set them above all principle. These several classes selected, a correspondent would inquire; how many of the disinterested worthies who ventured every thing for the support of the rights of their country, and the liberties of mankind, will be left to adorn that assembly, who have ambitiously and daringly presumed (without any commission for that purpose) to annihilate the sovereignties of the thirteen United States; to establish a DRACONIAN CODE; and to bind posterity by their secret councils? It may perhaps be replied that one third part of the body were of this generous description. Let us candidly grant it and examine their conduct; several of them left the assembly in disgust before the decision of the question. Others expressly reprobated the proceedings of a conclave, where it has been ridiculously asserted all the wisdom of America was concentered; and a Randolph, Mason, and Gerry, the firmness to avow their dissent to support their opinions in the Legislatures of their several States; and submit them to the observation of the world. It is true indeed that the ancient Doctor, who has been always republican in principle and conduct, doubted, trembled, hesitated, wept, and signed: While the illustrious President, not called upon to decide or necessitated to give his opinion, kept the chair, but undoubtedly painfully agitated for the fate of a country he had heroically lent his arm to defend.2 All the powers of eloquence are exerted to catch the ear, and the utmost pathos of expression employed to warm the imagination, in Mr. Wilson’s insiduous speech; but as it will doubtless be the subject of critical discussion by those who have leisure to examine both its principles, and its tendency, I will but cursorily observe that he discovers no less dexterity and address, in his oratorical explanation of the system, than he acknowledges was necessary to reconcile the jarring interests that opposed it—and finally to prevail with several whose objections were insurmountable, to lend their signature to an instrument for which he is obliged to ransack the annals of ancient and modern story to find a name. But he acknowledges that neither Rome, nor Britain, nor Switzerland, or Holland, bear much resemblance to the newly fabricated federal republic.—And [537]that he cannot find a precedent any where for the Heterogeneous Monster, unless it may be admitted in the Lycian league or the Amphictionic Council. It is here natural for every one acquainted with ancient history to turn their thoughts to the miserable fate of the Lycians. They were a sober, & virtuous people, who maintained their independence, and their freedom, for several centuries; and supported their own simple institutions, under twenty-three distinct sovereignties; until the reign of Leomitian, when they fell under the Roman yoke, with other cities of Greece, while the tyrant alledged the same excuse for his encroachment, that we hear hacknied in the streets of our capitals, for subjugating the Americans to the arms of power because they were no longer capable of enjoying their liberties. Nor is Mr. Wilson more fortunate in calling our attention to the ruin of the Amphictionic union. Every one will recollect that the Locrians, (a people bearing a strong resemblance to a party in America) had crept in among them, and that an ambitious Phillip had his emissaries in that body, who by political intrigue, and well timed plausible speeches, enabled him by the aid of a standing army, to set himself at the head of the Grecian States; to annihilate their constitutions, and to degrade them to the most abject submission to the will of a despotic tyrant. The application and the semblance is left for the consideration of every lover of his country. America has fought for her liberties; she has purchased them by the most costly sacrifices; she embarked in the enterprize with a spirit that gained her the applauses of mankind; and procured her emancipation from tyranny by the blood of her heroes, and her friends. And shall her honour, her character, her freedom, be sported away by the duplicity, and the intrigues of those, who never’ participated in her sufferings? Or by the machinations of such as have no pole star for their guide but the mad ambition of a mind ready to sacrifice the finest feelings of humanity for its gratification? Forbid it Heaven! and may the people awake from a kind of apathy which seems to pervade them, before they are aroused by the thunder of arms, or the insolence of dragooning parties, to arrest from the peasant, and the mechanic, the last farthing of their hard earnings, to support the splendid fabrick of Mr. Wilson’s Federal Republic.3 What an insiduous term! But this people are too wise to be long deceived by the extortion, or misapplication of words. Let the youth of America who are yet ignorant of the characters, and the causes that occasioned the dismemberment of the United States from the crown of Britain, read for themselves the many excellent publications, on the origin of government, and the rights of human nature, that appeared between the years 1763 and 1775.—And instead of indulging a rapturous admiration for the modern superficial [538]speechifyers in favour of an American monarchy; let them examine the principles of the late glorious revolution, and see how far they comport with the opinions in vogue. And before they embrace the chains of survitude, let them scrutinize their own hearts, and inquire, if their pride and their independency of spirit, will suffer them to lick the hand of a despotic master. And may the delegates for the ensuing convention consider well the importance of their decision. They will be applauded by the admiring world for making a stand at this critical conjuncture; or they will be execrated by all posterity for co-operating with the ambitious and intriguing spirits, who wish for the sake of their own advancement, to manacle a free and independent people, who have made the most astonishing and successful exertions to support their own rights, and to establish their rank among the nations. And when they shall have time to look around and be convinced, even Mr. Wilson acknowledges, “they will then spurn at every attempt to shackle them with despotic power.”4 Let them call for the name of the audacious man, who dared to say to his associates, in the late convention, “that unless they hurried the constitution through before the people had time for consideration, there was no probability that it would ever be adopted.”5 And let him be stigmatized with the odium that is due to the base betrayer of the rights of his country, and not absurdly trusted, though he may artfully have obtained an election, to decide a second time on a question in which he is so manifestly interested. It is obvious that there is not the smallest propriety that any of the members of that body, who have held out a system for the people to judge of, should themselves set in any of the State conventions, and have a voice to enforce their own alarming proceedings. Let the old Patriots come forward, and instead of secretly wraping up their opinions within their own breasts, let them lift up the voice like a trumpet, and shew this people their folly, and the trembling Columbia, her impending danger. Let none of them fear the arbitrary frown of either Otho, Galba, or Vitellius, nor the fate of HELVIDIUS PRISCUS."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/28/1787,"To the PEOPLE. We come now to the second and last article of complaint against the present confederation, which is, that Congress has not the sole power to regulate the intercourse between us and foreigners. Such a power extends not only to war and peace, but to trade and naturalization. This last article ought never to be given them; for though most of the state-; may be willing for certain reasons to receive foreigners as citizens, yet reasons of equal weight may induce other states, differently circumstanced, to keep their blood pure. Pennsylvania has chosen to receive all that would come there. Let any indifferent person judge whether that state in point of morals, education, energy is equal to any of the eastern states; the small state of Rhode-Island only excepted. Pennsylvania in the course of a century has acquired her present extent and population, at the expense of religion and good morals. The eastern states have, by keeping separate from the foreign mixtures, acquired their present greatness in the course of a century and an half, and have preserved their religion and morals. They have also preserved that manly virtue which is equally fitted for rendering them respectable in war, and industrious in peace. The remaining power for peace and trade might perhaps be safely enough lodged with Congress under some limitations. Three restrictions appear to me to be essentially necessary to preserve that equality of rights to the states, which it is the object of the state governments to secure to each citizen. 1st. It ought not to be in the power of Congress either by treaty or otherwise to alienate part of any state without the consent of the legislature. 2d. They ought not to be able by treaty or other law to give any legal preference to one part above another. 3d. They ought to be restrained from creating any monopolies. Perhaps others may propose different regulations and restrictions. One of these is to be found in the old confederation, and another in the newly proposed plan. The third seems to be equally necessary. After all that has been said and written on this subject, and on the difficulty of amending our old constitution so as to render it adequate to national purposes, it does not appear that any thing more was necessary to be done, than framing two new articles. By one a limited revenue would be given to Congress with a right to collect it, and by the other a limited right to regulate our intercourse with foreign nations. By such an addition we should have preserved to each state its power to defend the rights of the citizens, and the whole empire would be capable of expanding, and receiving additions without altering its former constitution. Congress, at the same lime, by the extent of their jurisdiction, and the number of their officers, would have acquired more respectability at home, and a sufficient influence abroad. If any state was in such a case to invade the rights of the Union, the other states would join in defence of those rights, and it would be in the power of Congress to direct the national force to that object. But it is certain that the powers of Congress over the citizens should be small in proportion as the empire is extended; that, in order to preserve the balance, each state may supply by energy what is wanting in numbers. Congress would be able by such a system as we have proposed to regulate trade with foreigners by such duties as should effectually give the preference to the produce and manufactures of our own country. We should then have a friendly intercourse established between the states, upon the principles of mutual interest. A moderate duty upon foreign vessels would give an advantage to our own people, while it would avoid all the [dis]advantages arising from a prohibition, and the consequent deficiency of vessels to transport the produce of the southern states. Our country is at present upon an average a thousand miles long from north to south, and eight hundred broad from the Missisippi to the Ocean. We have at least six millions of white inhabitants,2 and the annual increase is about two hundred and fifty thousand souls, exclusive of emigrants from Europe. The greater part of our increase is employed in settling the new lands, while the older settlements are entering largely into manufactures of various kinds. It is probable, that the extraordinary exertions of this state in the way of industry for the present year only, exceed in value five hundred thousand pounds. The new settlements, if all made in the same tract of country, would form a large state annually; and the time seems to be literally accomplished when a nation shall be born in a day. Such an immense country is not only capable of yielding all the produce of Europe, but actually does produce by far the greater part of the raw materials. The restrictions on our trade in Europe, necessarily oblige us to make use of those materials, and the high price of labour operates as an encouragement [542]to mechanical improvements. In this way we daily make rapid advancements towards independence in resources as well as in empire. If we adopt the new system of government we shall by one rash vote lose the fruit of the toil and expense of thirteen years, at the time when the benefits of that toil and expense are rapidly increasing. Though the imposts of Congress on foreign trade may tend to encourage manufactures, the excise and dry tax will destroy all the beneficial effects of the impost, at the same time that they diminish our capital. Be careful then to give only a limited revenue, and the limited power of managing foreign concerns. Once surrender the rights of internal legislation and taxation, and instead of being respected abroad, foreigners will laugh at us and posterity will lament our folly."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,12/29/1787,"To The MEMBERS of The CONVENTION of massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, You are called on, and will soon convene to conduct a matter of the last importance to your country—the confidence of your constituents in your abilities and integrity can never be more fully expressed, than by their suffrages on the present occasion—and on your wisdom and firmness is in a great measure suspended, the fate of the United States. In a free State like this, and under such circumstances, every individual must be anxious at the approach of an event, which will entail happiness or misery, not only on himself, his family, and the community, but also on his and their posterity:—The has therefore a right to address you, and your patriotism will prompt you to consider seriously, whatever shall be offered on the subject with reason and candour, and be worthy of your attention. Seneca I think has established this maxim, that in all concerns of life, we should enquire, first, what we want, and secondly, how we are to attain it?1—Apply these to the present case, and the answers are plain: We want a free, efficient federal government—and can only attain it, by a candid, dispassionate, discussion of the subject. A system of government has been proposed by the federal Convention: Some are for adopting, some for amending, and others for rejecting it: And when it is considered that a federal government must necessarily be more complicated in its nature, than a simple one, and that to form the latter, the ingenuity of man has never yet been able to establish fixed principles which will apply in all cases, is it a matter of surprize, that in forming a Federal Constitution, even sensible, disinterested men should differ in opinion, and require an investigation of their principles, in order to convince [551]each other, and to correct their mutual errours? Surely not, and the more calm and temperate their discussions are, the greater will be their prospect of success. Some able writers on both sides, have favoured us with their sentiments on the three great questions respecting the adoption, amendment, and rejection of the proposed plan of government, and we are much obliged to them for their diligent researches and ingenious remarks:—Others with little ability and less decency, have continually wounded the feelings of the publick, by railing against every one who has not subscribed their political creed; which if good in itself, would be rendered odious by the persecuting spirit of such ignorant zealots: But let them be informed, that their humour and petulance are not criterions for regulating the judgment of the publick; and that every individual has an equal right with themselves, to attend to the greatest of all earthly concerns, the establishment of good government.—Even the newspapers of Boston, have been thus disgraced.2 Boston has been famed for the liberality of its citizens, and for their attachment to liberty: And the reputation of so respectable a community should not be tarnished by illiberal productions. In investigating the subject of the proposed constitution, let us first inquire, upon what ground it stands: Because if it has no foundation, the superstructure must fall. The Federal Convention was first proposed by the legislature of Virginia, to whom America is much indebted for having taken the lead on the most important occasions.3—She first sounded the alarm respecting the intended usurpation and tyranny of Great-Britain, and has now proclaimed the necessity of more power and energy- in our federal government: But anxious as that wise State is for the attainment of these great objects, we find her not precipitate in adopting the new constitution. She has allowed herself time to consider the subject, and has deferred the meeting of her convention until May next—Several other States are of the same opinion, amongst which are the respectable States of New-York and Maryland.—Is it not then a matter worthy of your consideration, whether any disadvantage can result, nay, whether the greatest advantages may not accrue from an adjournment of the Convention of Massachusetts, until the sense of Virginia can be known? Too much light cannot be thrown on the subject, neither can a short delay possibly injure us; but an hasty decision may irretrievably ruin us. n consequence of the measures of Virginia respecting the calling a federal Convention, the legislature of this State on the 21st of February last. Resolved, “That five Commissioners be appointed by the General Court, who, or any three of whom, are hereby impowered to meet such commissioners as are or may be appointed by the legislatures of the [552]other States in the union, at Philadelphia, on the 2d day of May next; and with them to consider the trade and commerce of the United States, and how far an uniform system in their commercial intercourse and regulations may be necessary for their common interest and permanent harmony; and also to consider, how far it may be necessary to alter any of the articles of the present Confederation, so as to render the Constitution of the Federal Government more adequate to the exigencies of the union: And what further powers may be necessary to be vested in Congress for the common welfare and security, and with them to form a report for the purpose—such alterations and additions as may be made, to be however consistent, with the true republican spirit, and genius of the present articles of Confederation. Provided that the said Commissioners on the part of this Commonwealth, are hereby particularly instructed, by no means to interfere with the fifth of the articles of the Confederation, which provides for the annual election of delegates in congress, with a power reserved to each State, to recall its delegates, or any of them, within the year, and to send others in their stead for the remainder of the year—and which also provides that no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years, or being a delegate, shall be capable of holding any office under the United States, for which he or any other, for his benefit, receives any salary, fees, or emolument of any kind. “The report of the said Commissioners from the several legislatures to be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, to the intent, that if they shall judge it proper, they may recommend the said report or any part of it to the legislatures of the several States for their consideration: And if agreed to by them, that the same may become a part of the Confederation of the United States.”4 This was the resolution of Massachusetts, in consequence of the proposition of Virginia, but Congress having on the 21st of February,5 the same day on which this resolution passed, recommended a Federal Convention, our Legislature on the 7th of March last, repealed that, and massed the following resolve—“Whereas Congress did on the 21st day of February 1787, resolve, ‘That in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient that on the second Monday in May next, a Convention of Delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein, as shall when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by the States; render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union[’]—And whereas, the legislature of this Commonwealth did on the 3d day of the present month, elect the Hon. Francis Dana, Elbridge [553]Gerry, Nathaniel Gorham, Rufus King, and Caleb Strong, Esquires, delegates, or any three of them, to attend and represent this Common wealth at the aforesaid Convention for the sole and express purpose mentioned in the afore recited resolve of Congress, RESOLVED, That his Excellency the Governour be and he hereby is requested to grant to the said Francis Dana,” &c. “a commission agreeably to the said resolution of Congress.”6 The first of these resolves will shew that when the Legislature in February last, agreed to a Convention, the delegates of the State were to report measures not for abolishing but for preserving the articles of Confederation; for amending them; and for increasing their powers consistently with the true republican spirit and genius thereof—that the report was to have been made to Congress and that so much of it only as should be approved by them, and agreed to by the legislatures of the several States, was to become a part of the Confederation—the last of the resolves will shew, that in March last the legislature altered the powers of their delegates and conformed them to the resolve of Congress—that the utmost extent of this resolve, which united the views of Congress and our legislature, was to call a Convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the legislatures, such alterations and provisions therein as shall render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government, and the preservation of the union—that neither Congress nor the Legislature had the most distant idea of conducting the matter in a mode different from that presented by the Confederation, which provides “that the articles of Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union shall be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alterations be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.”7 That on the other hand, Congress in their resolve, and the legislature in both their resolves before recited, expressly provided, and they would have acted unconstitutionally to have done otherwise, that the alterations and provisions in the articles of Confederation, to have been reported by the Federal Convention, should be agreed to in Congress, and be confirmed by the legislative of the several States before they become part of the Federal Constitution."

Letter,No,Nathaniel Peaslee Sargeant,Joseph Badger,,,1/1/1788,"I make no doubt but you have carefully compared ye old confederation with ye new constitution and I wish you to review them again. Can there be such a thing as Government without Power? What is advice, recommendation, or requisition? It is not Government.—Congress has a right to raise an army, to make war and Peace, of entering into [564]Treaties and alliances to borrow money and appropriate ye same—to ascertain ye sums necessary to be raised for ye Service of ye United States—to emit bills of credit—to build and equip a navy, and to make requisitions on ye states for their quota of men, to Cloath, arm and equip them. But who will lend Congress Money when they have not Power to raise a Single Shilling to repay them? Who will take their bills of Credit when every Body knows they can never redeem them? Who will enlist into their army when Congress has no money to pay them a Bounty or their wages or find them in Provisions? Who will build and equip a navy for them without money? Who will trouble themselves about Congress’ making war or Peace when they can’t command a Shilling to support a war? To what Purpose is it to appropriate money when they can’t get it?—What end does it answer for other nations to make treaties and alliances with Congress when any one State by its obstinacy, fraud or some Paltry private interest may defeat ye treaty or by main force break through it? What good end will be answered by ascertaining ye Sums necessary to be raised when thirteen independent Legislatures are to judge whether those sums are necessary or not and whether they will raise them or not and if one State won’t raise their quota, ye other states are more than foolish, they are distracted if they raise theirs.—What effect will a requisition on ye states for raising, cloathing, arming, and equipping their quotas of men have, when ye 13 Legislatures are left to judge of ye expediency, or necessity of this equipment, whether they are not charged above their proportion—whether it won’t do as well sometime hence? What security is it possible to have under such a Government? A Government without energy, without power. Zeal and enthusiasm carried us thro’ ye last war without any Government till March 178, when ye Confederation was compleated and then we hobbled along 21 months longer under it until peace took place, and since ye Peace, Requisitions from Congress have had no more effect than ye Pope’s bulls wou’d have had. The old Confederation is just ye same to ye United States as a people, as a milk and water diet wou’d be to a labouring man, both wou’d grow weaker and weaker till they were not able to crawl. Nothing ever gave us any respectability abroad but ye readiness and chearfulness with which we complied with all ye recommendations of Congress when we had no Government at all. That enabled us to form treaties with other nations, to hire money, and their hatred to Great Britain engaged them to join in ye war against her. The nations in Europe discovered this weakness long before we did. Great Britain for 5 years has refused to make any Treaty of commerce [565]with us, has shut all her Ports against our shipping, while our Ports are filled with their shipping and seamen and are picking up our seamen for their employ—they bring their Produce and manufactures to us to buy but won’t let us carry our own to them. They have embarrass’d our commerce with other nations by setting ye Algerines upon our shipping and thereby obliged us to give 5 per Cent, to them for insurance against the Algerines—all this while we have not had ye power to retalliate upon them in one Single Article. The other Powers viz: France, Holland, Spain and Portugal have now taken ye hint and are imposing duties upon our Produce and Manufactures to ye great encouragement of their own and discouragement of ours, and we can’t make any Regulations to counterwork them. Massachusetts some years ago took ye lead and made some very advantageous Regulations. New Hampshire followed, and Rhode Island adopted a small part. Soon ye People in New Hampshire grew restive and obliged ye Government, to repeal ye same. Rhode Island followed and Massachusetts was obliged to follow them, so that you see what a rope of sand we are. This conduct of ye European nations will in time, if it produces good Government, prove of eminent advantage to us. They drained us of almost all our Cash. This put People upon being industrious and frugal. Industry has occasioned great improvements in agriculture and in manufactures. The first has rendered Provisions plenty and so cheap that we sell them to almost all nations. The latter has supplied us with many necessaries which we used to send cash for, and we remitted to other nations [to] pay for what necessaries we wanted. Frugality has prevented us from sending our Cash abroad for many Superfluities which we can do as well or perhaps better without; so that now it is an undoubted fact that ye exports from America greatly exceed ye imports; consequently Cash may now become as plenty as it wou’d be best it shou’d be. The old Confederation without Power or Energy destroyed ye Credit of ye United States. The scarcity of Cash, and ye embarrassments of ye Government, for want of some fixed System of finance has destroyed ye credit of ye individual States—different Tender acts in different States, different sorts of paper money in different States, (for almost all ye States have either paper money or tender acts,) have destroyed private Credit; so that we are now as a people and as individuals totally without either public or private Credit. Under these circumstances money never can circulate in plenty, let ye advantages for importing it be what they may— Is it now possible for a Government, under these disadvantages, whether it be continental or particular, to support itself any length of [566]time? Will not private industry be discouraged? Can such a Government protect ye industrious from ye hands of invaders or ye more savage hands of violence among ourselves? Anarchy will soon rear its head and ye Tyranny of some ambitious Demagogue will soon tread on its heels. Suppose for a moment ye General Court of New Hampshire or Massachusetts were to agree that such a sum of money was necessary to be raised for ye building and maintaining of a colledge for supporting schools in different Parts, for supporting ministers, for encouraging ye Iron manufactory, ye manufactory of cloath, for repairing ye highways, for training and disciplining ye militia, and procuring a stock of guns and ammunition and building forts for ye defence of ye State and then send a recommendation to ye several towns desiring them to raise their quota of that sum, being so much. Wou’d not this be a laughable way of raising money for ye public exigences? One town wou’d say there was no need of building a Colledge; others wou’d say there is no need of Schools or ministers; let them that work Iron and cloath get their own pay; our highways will do well enough without repairs; ye militia are good gunners already, there is no need of forts, and there is no war at hand, and we can do without Guns and ammunition a little longer; besides all they have rated our town too high. Wou’d not this be ye common language? A precious little money wou’d be raised, I trow. Let me ask, if ye People in our town meetings are competent Judges of ye necessity and advantage of raising money for these purposes? You will instantly answer me, no not one in six. Can they have large and extensive views of ye interest, of ye essential and important interests of ye whole state? No, perhaps, not one, thô many of them when they had met with other persons from all parts of ye state, and had freely conversed with them might be good Judges afterwards. How absurd and impolitic then is it to trust ye great affairs and interests of a continent, 1500 miles long and 1000 miles wide to ye determination of 2600 men deputed from some little spots of 6 miles square ye greatest part of whom never went further than ye next market town perhaps, or at ye outside to ye shire town of ye state and never expects to go again after his year is up, or if he does, it is only to get his 3s. 6d. a day without labour or at ye most to have ye honour of saving a small Tax upon his own town—and these men are not to meet altogether where they might, if disposed, get ye necessary information to form a Judgment by,—but in thirteen different places where they have different interests, different leaders and different information. How much more ridiculous is it then, that all these men are to determine of ye necessity of Peace or War—of ye sums of Money necessary to be raised, of ye best and easiest mode of raising it thro’ [567]all ye states, regulating ye value of money thro’ all ye states, of defining and punishing Piracies and felonies on ye high seas and of Offences against ye law of nations—when it is necessary and proper to grant Letters of Marque and reprisal—what are ye rights and duties of Ambassadors, Consuls and public ministers, what are proper rules respecting captures where other nations are concerned with us in ye capture or are interested in ye vessel captured, what regulations of Trade may be carried into effect in other nations so as not to injure our own commerce. These and a thousand other matters respecting our intercourse with other nations and other great national concerns, must be determined by some Body of men with decision and be carried into effect too. How preposterous is it then for us to think of going on under ye old Confederation where ye several states or some of them wou’d hiss any Law that might be proposed on those matters out of Doors. Now let us consider ye new Constitution. Are there any objects, of Legislation in this, which were not left to ye decision of Congress under ye old Articles? Very few, save that of Regulating commerce with foreign nations for want of which we have suffered enough already—also to form a rule for naturalization Laws about Bankruptcies—fix ye standard of weights and measures—to promote ye progress of arts and Sciences—to prevent counterfeiting ye Securities and current coin of ye states, to provide for organizing, arming, disciplining and calling forth ye militia on necessary occasions; to exercise exclusive Jurisdiction over 10 miles square of land where Congress may sit, if so much is ceded to them by any state to their satisfaction and such other places where continental arsenals are kept. Our People are taught ye necessity of this provision for if a man of less penetration and decision had been in ye chair ye year before last—they would have lost their most useful and costly magazine. Is it not reasonable that these matters shou’d be done with uniformity thro’ ye states? Can these great objects ever be accomplished without making laws to bind all persons in ye Jurisdiction? Who are to make those Laws but ye Representatives chosen by ye People at large every two years, and where an equal representation is provided for, and a Senate chosen by ye state Legislatures, one third of which are to be chosen every two years. When Laws are made they are nonsensical unless they can be carried into execution; therefore it is necessary somebody shou’d have a Power of determining when they are broken, and to decree ye forfieture in consequence of such breach. This shows ye necessity of ye Judicial Power—and an executive with ye necessary officers are requisite for carrying those decrees into execution—and without all this ye whole parade of making laws wou’d be idle. That these parts, ye Judicial and executive, shou’d be appointed by congress is necessary in order that ye proceedings may be uniform and to prevent one state from conniving at or disregarding ye laws made for ye benefit of ye whole. If they are to raise money they must have officers to collect it. These must be appointed by Congress or such men will be appointed by particular states as will shew ye most favour—and look thro’ ye whole, I believe you will not find a Single Power given but what would maim ye constitution if it was left out. Perhaps it may be said this will be an expensive Government. The Legislative will not be more expensive, if so much, as ye present congress for after they have got matters a going properly, they may be at home half their time. The other officers must be paid it is true, but when we consider ye advantages of a steady uniform Government with proper energy, I believe we shall find ye Benefits purchased at a cheap rate. Perhaps some may say that this annihilates our own state Governments, and our own Legislatures will have nothing to do; but ye Laws respecting criminal offenders in all cases, except Treason, are subjects for Legislation. We may increase, lessen, or change punishments for crimes as we think best, and make any act criminal or pœnal as far as Law can make it so at our pleasure. The regulating Towns, parishes, Providing ministers, schools, looking after Poor persons, punishing Idlers, vagabonds &c. &c. regulating Highways, bridges, fisheries, common fields &c. are also matters pertaining to ye General court—but above all ye great rules for regulating inheritances, descent of estates, Partition of them, last wills and Testaments, executors, Administrators, and Guardians are subjects for our own Legislation—ye appointment of all courts, and ye rules of Proceeding in them and of determining all controversies between our own citizens, Rules of Legitimacy, marriage and divorce and in fine all matters not expressly given to congress are still to be the subjects of our own Legislation to be carried into Effect by our own courts and officers.

Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/1/1788,"To the PEOPLE. Friends and Brethren, It is a duty incumbent on every man, who has had opportunities for inquiry to lay the result of his researches on any matter of publick importance before the publick eye. No further apology will be necessary with the generality of my readers, for having so often appeared before them on the subject of the lately proposed form of government. It has been treated with that freedom which is necessary or the investigation of truth, and with no greater freedom. On such a subject, extensive in its nature, and important in its consequences, the examination has necessarily been long, and the topicks treated of have been various. We have been obliged to take a cursory, but not inaccurate view of the circumstances of mankind under the different forms of government to support the different parts of our argument. Permit me now to bring into one view the principal propositions on which the reasoning depends. It is shewn1 from the example of the most commercial republick of antiquity, which was never disturbed by a sedition for above seven hundred years, and at last yielded after a violent struggle to a foreign enemy,2 as well as from the experience of our own country for a century and an half; that the republican, more than any other form of government is made of durable materials. It is shewn from a variety of proof, that one consolidated government is inapplicable to a great extent of country; is unfriendly to the rights both of persons and property, which rights always adhere together; and that being contrary to the interest of the extreme of an empire, such a government can be supported only by power, and that commerce is the true bond of union for a free state. It is shewn from a comparison of the different parts of the proposed plan, that it is such a consolidated government. By article 3, section 2, Congress are empowered to appoint courts with authority to try civil causes of every kind, and even offences against particular states; by the last clause of article 1, section 8, which defines their legislative powers, they are authorised to make laws for carrying into execution all the “powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof;” and by article 6, the judges in every state are to be bound by the laws of Congress. It is therefore a complete consolidation of all the states into one, however diverse the parts of it may be. It is also shewn that it will operate unequally in the different states, taking from some of them a greater share of wealth; that in this last respect it will operate more to the injury of [577]this commonwealth than of any state in the union; and that by reason of its inequality it is subversive of the principles of a free government, which requires every part to contribute an equal proportion. For all these reasons this system ought to be rejected, even if no better plan was proposed in the room of it. In case of a rejection we must remain as we are, with trade extending, resources opening, settlements enlarging, manufactures increasing, and publick debts diminishing by fair payment. These are mighty blessings, and not to be lost by the hasty adoption of a new system. But great as these benefits are, which we derive from our present system, it has been shewn, that they may be increased by giving Congress a limited power to regulate trade, and assigning to them those branches of the impost on our foreign trade only, which shall be equal to our proportion of their present annual demands. While the interest is thus provided for, the sale of our lands in a very few years will pay the principal, and the other resources of the state will pay our own debt. The present mode of assessing the continental tax is regulated by the extent of landed property in each state.3 By this rule the Massachusetts has to pay one eighth. If we adopt the new system, we shall surrender the whole of our impost and excise, which probably amount to a third of those duties of the whole continent, and must come in for about a sixth part of the remaining debt. By this means we shall be deprived of the benefit arising from the largeness of our loans to the continent, shall lose our ability to satisfy the just demands on the state. Under the limitations of revenue and commercial regulation contained in these papers, the balance will be largely in our favour: the importance of the great states will be preserved, and the publick creditors both of the continent and state will be satisfied without burdening the people. For a more concise view of my proposal, I have thrown it into the form of a resolve supposed to be passed by the convention which is shortly to set in this town. “Commonwealth of Massachusetts. “Resolved, That the form of government lately proposed by a federal convention, held in the city of Philadelphia, is so far injurious to the interests of this commonwealth, that we are constrained by fidelity to our constituents to reject it; and we do hereby reject the said proposed form and every part thereof. But in order that the union of these states may, as far as possible, be promoted, and the federal business as little obstructed as may be, we do agree on the part of this commonwealth, that the following addition be made to the present articles of confederation. [“]XIV. The United States shall have power to regulate the intercourse between these states and foreign dominions, under the following restrictions, viz. 1st. No treaty, ordinance, or law shall alienate the [578]whole or part, of any state, without the consent of the legislature of such state. 2d. The United States shall not by treaty or otherwise give a preference to the ports of one state over those of another; nor, 3d. create any monopolies or exclusive companies; Nor, 4th, extend the privileges of citizenship to any foreigner. And for the more convenient exercise of the powers hereby, and by the former articles given, the United States shall have authority to constitute judicatories, whether supreme or subordinate, with power to try all piracies and felonies done on the high seas, and also all civil causes in which a foreign state, or subject thereof actually resident in a foreign country and not being British absentees, shall be one of the parties. They shall also have authority to try all causes in which ambassadours shall be concerned. All these trials shall be by jury and in some sea-port town. All imposts levied by Congress on trade shall be confined to foreign produce or foreign manufactures imported, and to foreign ships trading in our harbours, and all their absolute prohibitions shall be confined to the same articles. All imposts and confiscations shall be to the use of the state in which they shall accrue, excepting in such branches as shall be assigned by any state as a fund for defraying their proportion of the continental. And no powers shall be exercised by Congress but such as are expressly giver by this and the former articles. And we hereby authorize our delegates in Congress, to sign and ratify an article in the foregoing form and words, without any further act of this state for that purpose, provided the other states shall accede to this proposition on their part on or before the first day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord 1790. All matters of revenue being under the controul of the legislature, we reccommend to the general court of this commonwealth, to devise, as early as may be, such funds arising from such branches of foreign commerce, as shall be equal to our part of the current charges of the continent, and to put Congress in possession of the revenue arising therefrom, with a right to collect it, during such term as shall appear to be necessary for the payment of the principal of their debt, by the sale of the western lands.” By such an explicit declaration of the powers given to Congress, we shall provide for all federal purposes, and shall at the same time secure our rights. It is easier to amend the old confederation, defective as it has been represented, than it is to correct the new form. For with what ever view it was framed, truth constrains me to say, that it is insiduous in its form, and ruinous in its tendency. Under the pretence of different branches of the legislature, the members will in fact be chosen from the same general description of citizens. The advantages of a check will [579]be lost, while we shall be continually exposed to the cabals and corruption of a British election. There cannot be a more eligible mode than the present, for appointing members of Congress,4 nor more effectual checks provided than our separate state governments, nor any system so little expensive, in case of our adopting the resolve just stated, or even continuing as we are. We shall in that case avoid all the inconvenience of concurrent jurisdictions, we shall avoid the expensive and useless establishments of the Philadelphia proposition, we shall preserve our constitution and liberty, and we shall provide for all such institutions as will be useful. Surely then you cannot hesitate, whether you will chuse freedom or servitude. The object is now well defined. By adopting the form proposed by the convention, you will have the derision of foreigners, internal misery, and the anathemas of posterity. By amending the present confederation, and granting limited powers to Congress, you secure the admiration of strangers, internal happiness, and the blessings and prosperity of all succeeding generations. Be wise then, and by preserving your freedom, prove, that Heaven bestowed it not in vain. Many will be the efforts to delude the convention. The mode of judging is itself suspicious, as being contrary to the antient and established usage of the commonwealth. But since this mode is adopted, we trust, that the numbers of that venerable assembly will not so much regard the greatness of their power, as the sense and interest of their constituents. And they will do well to remember that even a mistake in adopting it, will be destructive, while no evils can arise from a total, and much less, probably, from such a partial rejection as we have proposed. I have now gone through my reasonings on this momentous subject, and have stated the facts and deductions from them, which you will verify for yourselves. Personal interest was not my object, or I should have pursued a different line of conduct. Though I conceived that a man who owes allegiance to the state, is bound, on all important occasions, to propose such inquiries as tend to promote the publick good; yet I did not imagine it to be any part of my duty to present myself to the fury of those, who appear to have other ends in view. For this cause, and for this only, I have chosen a feigned signature. At present all the reports concerning the writer of these papers are merely conjectural. I should have been ashamed of my system, if it had needed such feeble support as the character of individuals. It stands on the firm ground of the experience of mankind. I cannot conclude this long disquisition better, than with a caution derived from the words of inspiration. Discern the things of your peace now in the days thereof, before they be hidden from your eyes.5"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/2/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, It clearly appeared by the resolutions quoted in my last address,1 that the utmost extent of the views of Congress, and of the Legislature of this State; in calling a Federal Convention, was, that it should revise the articles of Confederation, and report such alterations and provisions therein, as shall render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and preservation of the union—that neither Congress or the Legislature had the most distant idea of conducting the matter in a mode different from that prescribed by the Confederation—but that on the other hand, they expressly provided, and would have acted unconstitutionally to have [590]done otherwise, that the proceedings of the Convention, before they become a part of the Federal Constitution, should be agreed to by Congress and confirmed by the Legislatures of the several states. No one I presume will deny that the powers of the delegates of this state, were as full and extensive as either Congress or any of the Legislatures had authority to give—that the powers of the other delegate[s] were in general, more limited—and that had any of them been more ample than those of Massachusetts, they must have been founded in usurpation and therefore have been null and void. And have the Federal Convention, in pursuance of their powers, reported the alterations and provisions mentioned in the recited resolve of Congress? If they have, let us call on Congress, to inform us, whether they have agreed to the report, and to transmit it when approved, to the Legislature for their consideration: This would be conducting upon constitutional principles, but the call would be vain, there is no such report, and the original design of forming the Convention has not been carried into effect. The Convention nevertheless have reported a new system, and the object of it is, a consolidation of the union. Mr. Wilson denies this fact, and says “if this was a just objection, it would be strongly against the system2 But unfortunately for that gentleman, his memory appears to be very defective, for he forgot that he has said, in the letter to Congress, signed “George Washington, president, by unanimous order of the Convention”—“In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of the union.”3 There the Convention have candidly avowed their intentions, and how Mr. Wilson can reconcile his jarring and contradictory assertions, I am at a loss to determine. The Convention then having kept “steadily in view” “a consolidation of the union,” it is incumbent on every one who is zealous for the infallibility of the Convention, and liberal in abusing those who dare to think for themselves, to admit that the proposed plan compleatly embraces the object of consolidation, for otherwise he will call in question the ability of the Convention to execute their design—indeed it must be evident to every one who will attentively read the new system, that it secures to all intents and purposes the consolidation intended. And here permit me to remark on an argument, in favour of the new plan, often urged and drawn from the respectable characters of General Washington and Doctor Franklin: Let those gentlemen have every honour that can be paid them, they are justly entitled to it—but of what consequence is it to the publick, whether the members who assented or dissented to the new plan, were influenced by virtuous and disinterested, or by vicious and selfish motives? If the plan is properly before the States, is good, and will [591]secure to them “peace, liberty and safety” should it not be adopted, were they even sure that every member who subscribed it was in principle a Caligula or a Nero? And if the plan is bad and will entail slavery on the land, ought it not to be rejected should every subscriber excel in wisdom and integrity Lycurgus or Solon. Surely the good or bad effects of the system, depend not on the characters of the original framers, but on the system itself, and on those who may administer it; and no man of candour and discernment will urge characters, as an argument for or against this system, however respectable the characters of any particular members, or of the members in general of the federal convention, may be: They had no other authority to act in this matter, than what was derived from their commissions—when they ceased to act in conformity thereto, they ceased to be a federal convention, and had no more right to propose to the United States the new form of government, than an equal number of other gentlemen, who might voluntarily have assembled for this purpose—The members of the convention therefore, admitting they have the merit of a work of supererogation, have thereby inferred no kind of obligation on the States to consider, much less to adopt this plan of consolidation. The consolidation of the union! What a question is this, to be taken up and decided by thirty nine gentlemen,4 who had no publick authority whatever for discussing it!—To be submitted to the people at large, before it has been considered or even agitated by Congress, or any of the Legislatures, and to be transmitted with such precipitation to the States merely “for their assent and ratification?” True it is, that neither Congress or the Legislatures could decide this great question; the first are restrained by the confederation, and the last by the federal and state constitutions—but Congress and the Legislatures, if they thought it necessary, might at any time have considered the subject, expressed their sentiments on it, and recommended to the people an election of State conventions to have taken up the matter. Had this been done the important question would have been previously canvassed; and understood by Congress and the Legislatures; and explained to the people; and the publick opinion would have been thus united in some salutary measure—but as the matter has been conducted, a system of consolidation has been formed with the most profound secrecy, and without the least authority: And has been suddenly and without any previous notice transmitted by the federal convention for ratification—Congress not disposed to give any opinion on the plan, have transmitted it to the legislatures—The legislatures have followed the example, and sent it to the people. The people of this State, unassisted by Congress or their legislature, have not had time to investigate the subject, have referred to the newspapers for information, have been divided by contending writers, [592]and under such circumstances have elected members for the State Convention—and these members are to consider whether they will accept the plan of the federal convention, with ALL its imperfections, and bind the people by a system of government, of the nature and principles of which they have not at present a clearer idea, than they have of the Copernican system. What are we to expect, from such a mode of proceeding? Are not the people already thrown into great confusion? Are not heats, animosities, and a party spirit very prevalent and daily increasing? Are the citizens of this State in a proper temper to receive information, either of the ratification, or rejection, of the new constitution? Is there a probability of its being supported, if so precipitately adopted? Surely it must appear that the plan, although improperly before the State, cannot with safety be rejected—that it cannot as it stands, be safely accepted—that the people will not be satisfied with a ratification, and the delusive prospect of future alterations—and that the only hope that remains of preserving the peace and happiness of this Commonwealth, is from amending the plan in order to its adoption."
Newspaper,No,Candidus,,Independent Chronicle,,1/3/1788,"Mess’rs Printers, It has long been the boast of the Americans, that they are privileged above all other nations, by having it in their power, to adopt a Constitution on the free deliberations of the people.—The attempts therefore, which have been made to destroy this freedom, must be peculiarly disgusting to every man, who sincerely wishes the happiness and welfare of his country. As a citizen of this Commonwealth, I ventured to offer my sentiments on a subject, which is now before the people, for their consideration. The infamous publications, which have appeared in consequence of my remarks, serve only to expose the insolence of party writers, who are anxious to curb every candid enquiry, least they should be disappointed in their fancied expectations.1 No person within these States, more sincerely wishes the adoption of a federal system; being sensible of the necessity of an efficient Government, to establish our national respectability, and promote our agriculture, manufactures and commerce; but through the violence of party zeal, every man who dares exercise his own judgment, is branded as an antifederalist, tho’ his sentiments should wholly correspond with the repeated requisitions of Congress. This ungenerous method of condemning characters, is contrary to that candour, which actuates the citizens of these states. Freedom of debate in all national questions, has ever been held sacred among a free people; the great subject now submitted to the public, most certainly claims this indulgence, as on its impartial discussion, every thing that is valuable depends. The adoption of the proposed Constitution, being a concern of such magnitude, we are in duty bound to hear with patience, the observations of our fellow citizens, provided their remarks are delivered with calmness and propriety; this candid disposition towards each other, cannot at this time injure us, but would be the means to unite every man, [610]in embracing a system of Government, which might forever secure the liberties of this Country."

ONE of the PEOPLE, gives his compliments to MARIOT, in the Centinel of yesterday, and would be glad to know, on his principles, What, need there can be of checks in a Constitution at all?

Letter,No,Samuel Osgood,Samuel Adams,,,1/5/1788,"I recd. your favor duely with its Enclosure which I forwarded by that worthy Gentlemans Brother.2 you honor me, Sir, by requesting my Sentiments at this critical Moment—I will readily acknowledge, that I long labored to convince myself that the proposed System, would answer, for a Plan of general Government—That the extreme Necessity of a more efficient federal Government than the present—The Uncertainty of obtaining Amendments as well as the Delay, if they should be obtained, had some Weight on my Mind—The all important Reason with many for adopting the Plan without Amendments—is, that if we don’t accept of the one proposed, we shall have none. This seems to allow that the Objections made against it, are good; the Plain Meaning of it, is then, that Despotism is better for us, than to remain as we are. It would take me much Time, as well as Paper to arrange all my Ideas on his important Plan—It has scarcely been out of my Mind since it first made its Appearance—In combining, & comparing its various Paris, new Ideas are constantly occuring—And I am more & more perswaded, that it is a Plan, that the common People can never understand—That if adopted—the Scribes & Pharisees only will be able to interpret, & give it a Meaning.— Mr. Wilsons Observation, so often repeated is true, “That what ever is not given is reserved.”3—But the great Question upon this is what is there of Consequence to the People that is not given. The general Government will have the unlimited Power [of?] collecting Money immediately from the People—The most important Object of this Government are to prevent foreign Wars, & to regulate the Commerce of the United States with foreign Nations—for these Objects alone, the People cannot & ought not to appropriate all their Revenue—It is said the State Legislatures are to [operate in?] that [particular?] [– – –] [– – –] the internal Police of the State will be a Duty incumbent on them—It is undoubtedly true, that the Happiness of the People, in this View, will depend as much (if not more) on the State Legislatures, as on the general Government; & [yet?] as they have no exclusive Revenue left them; it may [further?] be said they have no Revenue at all—No good Reason in my Opinion has, or can be assigned for placing the Legislatures in this absurd Situation; provided the Intent is, that they shall continue for the Objects of internal Police—The Absurdity in this Instance, made such an Impression on me, that I examined the Plan, to see if the general Government was not furnished [619]expressly with Powers to legislate in all possible Cases, & there[fore?] to releive the State Legislatures from the Necessity of meeting at all for any Purposes of Legislation; & I am satisfied that this is a Fact.—The Plan of complete consolidation by the proposed Instrument could not be eff[ected?] if the States retained exclusively a Part of their Revenue. But as they Do not—it may be brot about; & in a Way [that?] has not been handed to the public yet.— The unlimited Power of exclusive Legislation is expressly given to Congress, over a Place not exceeding ten Miles Square—Here every Species of Legislation must be gone into.—The Laws thus made, will be made in Pursuance of the Constitution; & if so, they will be the supreme Law of the Land, & the Judges in every State will be sworn to obey them. It will not be in the Power of the Judge to discriminate, & say, that one Law is confined to the Limits of ten Miles Square, & that another Law pervades all the States: every Law must be considered as a Law of the United States made in Pursuance of the Constitution. The Judicial Power extends to all Cases of Law & Equity arising under the Constitution &ca—The Extent of the Judicial Power is therefore, as indefinite & unlimited as Words can make it—Where the united States are a Party against a State the supreme Judicial Court have expressly original Jurisdiction—suppose then, any State should object to the exercise of Power by Congress as infringing the Constitution of the State, the legal Remedy is to try the Question before the supreme Judicial Court—& they have Power, not confining themselves to the Letter of the general or State Constitutions, to consider & determine upon it, in Equity—This is in Fact leaving the Matter to the Judges of the supreme judicial Court—They may by a Number of legal Decisions, make what Constitution they Please for the united States.—I am doubtful whether any Instance can be found, where a free People have voluntarily established, so great & so important, a supreme Judicial Court.— A Legislature without corresponding Judicial Courts is of no Consequence to the People—That this must result from the System; that the State Legislatures will have no Judicial Courts, is not difficult to make apparent—The continental Judicial is to decide on Controversies between Citizens of different States—A Citizen of Masstts. commences Process against a fellow Citizen—Altho the Plaintiff is not in fact a Citizen of New hampshire, yet in Law he is so, & entitled to all the Priviledges & Immunities of a Citizen of New hampshire, one of which is to try a Massachusetts Man before a continental Court.—Therefore the ingenious Lawyer, will always make one appear before the Court as a Citizen in Law, & the other as a Citizen in fact—which will give the continental Court Cognizance of Controversies between two Citizens of [620]the same State—What Use then for a State Judicial? of what Consequence will be the State Bill of Rights—The continental Judicial are nor bound by it. I think, Sir, that the Judicial Net is spread; & it will not hereafter be said, we have toiled all Day and caught nothing.—We have traced the State Legislatures to a Situation, where they have neither Money at command, & their Judicial Courts strip[p]ed of all Business—Suppose then it should be made a Question before the supreme Judicial Court of the united States, whether, in Equity, a State Legislature should be kept in Existence, for any other Purpose than mere Elections, which has neither Money, nor Judicial Courts—I believe no one can doubt what the Decision would be. The Framers of the Plan seem to have had this in View; for the Congress have expressly the Power of making or altering the Times & Manner of choosing the Senators. How far the Word “Manner” extends I know not—But I suppose, if Congress should determine, that the People at large, or a certain Description of them, should vote on the Senators, it would only be altering the Manner of choosing them—If this be true, Congress will have the exclusive Right of pointing out the Qualification of the Voters for Senators, which will undoubtedly limit the States, to a small Number of Voters.—The Electors for a President stand upon the same precarious Ground—Whether they are to continue Electors for Life, or for one Choice, only, does not appear. It is apparent by attending to the 2d. Clause of the 2d. Article, that the Existence of the State Legislature is rot necessary for the Purpose of choosing Electors. The Supporters of the Plan have asserted that the Existence of the State Legislatures is secured, because they must meet for the Purpose of Organizing, from Time to Time, the general Government; that their Existence must necessarily be co extensive. But this I doubt of very much—Surely, in Equity, without the Existence of the State Legislatures, the continental Government must exist.—And not merely in Consequence of the Purse & the Sword, but in Consequence of the Equitable Powers of the Compact. But, Sir, if the above Reasoning is not fair, & well founded, tho’ I do not see but it is—yet let us give the Supporters the Sum total of their Argument, the State Legislatures must exist, for the Purpose of Elections.—& is this all?—Then let us give them another Name—It is not fit that a Board of Electors Should be called a Legislature. I am, Sir, for a fair, explicit & efficient general Government—But I cannot consent, in this Way, to be conclaved out of a Bill of Rights.—This Government is expressly, by its admiring Advocates, to reach the Life Liberty & Property of the Individual Person of every one in the united States, capable of feeling the Government—Mar is a weak, foolish Creature of Habit; governed by Instinct as other [621]Animals; tame & docile; without Sagacity: therefore, the’ he dislikes it at first, Time will meliorate & soften his Savage Manners & Disposition; he will then bear the Chains quietly.—But, Sir, this is not true.—This mighty fabric will not give us an efficient Government for many years; the Supporters of it allow it; what will it do? It will be shut up in the ten Miles Square with very little Knowledge of its Operations, until by Bribery and Corruption, & an undue Use of the public Monies, Nabobs are created in each State; & then the Scenery will be changed; the Mask will be laid aside.—It has cost me many a Sleepless Night to find out the most obnoxious Part of the proposed Plan.—And I have finally fixed upon the exclusive Legislation in the Ten Miles Square.—This space is capable of holding two Millions of People—Here will the Wealth and Riches of every State center—And shall there be in the Bowels of the united States such a Number of People, brot up under the Hand of Despotism, without one Priviledge of Humanity, that they can claim; all must be Grace & favor to them.—Shall the supreme Legislature of the most enlightened People on the Face of the Earth; a People who have recently offered up,—upon the Altar of Freedom, near sixty thousand of their bravest Men, & near two hundred Millions of specie Dollars—be secluded from the World of Freemen; & seated down among Slaves & Tenants at Will?—And have not this supreme Legislature a Right to naturalize me there: whether I will or not? What means the establishing of an uniform Rule of Naturalization?—What does it mean in Equity? May not the sovereign of the Country, Grant exclusive Privilidges to all that are willing to be naturalized in that hallowed Spot?—What an inexhaustable Fountain of Corruption are we opening? The Revenue there collected will not belong to the united States. Upon proper Principles, I wish the Legislature of the united States to have Ten Miles Square—But let the People settled there, have a Bill of Rights. Let them know that they are Freemen—Let them have the Liberty of Speech, of the Press, of Religion, &ca Let them when numerous enough be represented in the lower House.—Let the Revenue there collected be accounted for to the united States as other Revenue—Let the Laws made for the internal Police, have a partial & not a general Stile.—Mankind are too much disposed to barter away their Freedom for the Sake of Interest.—The deluded Philadelphians have however egregiously miscalculated. If the Ten Miles Square should betaken agreeably to their offer, one Mile above the no[r]thern Liberties of their City—a very few years will empty the City of Philadelphia4—They will be naturally dazzled with the Splendor of the New Government & Insect like, be drawn to it.— I have said, & I beleive if the new Government should take Place, it would prove true, that the first Rebellion against it, would break out in the Town of Boston.—Masstts. has about 400.000 Inhabitants—There is therefore now, one Representative [for?] 50.000—Boston has about 15 or 16.000 Inhabitants she has little Chance of sending one Representative to a Body, who are to regulate all their commercial Concerns.—"
Newspaper,No,Elbridge Gerry,,Massachusetts Centinel,A Landholder,1/5/1788,"Mr. Russell. You are desired to inform the publick from good authority, That Mr. Gerry, by giving his dissent to the proposed constitution, could have no motive for preserving an office, for he holds none under the United States, or any of them;—that he has not, as has been asserted, exchanged continental for State securities: and if he had, it would have been for his interest to have supported the new system, because thereby the States are restrained from impairing the obligation of contracts, and by a transfer of such securities, they may be recovered in the new federal court:—That he never heard in the Convention a motion made, much less did he make any for “the redemption of the old continental money,” but that he proposed, the publick debt should be made neither better or worse by the new system, but stand precisely on the same ground as it now does by the articles of confederation—that had there been such a motion, he was not interested in it, as he did not then, neither does he now own the value often pounds in old continental money;—that he never was called on for his reasons for not signing, but stated them fully in the progress of the business:1 His objections are principally contained in his letter to the legislature:2—that he believes his colleagues men of too much honour to assert what is not truth, that his reasons in the convention “were totally different from those which he has published:”—that his only motive for dissenting from the new constitution, was a firm persuasion that it would endanger the liberties of America:—that if the people are of a different opinion, they have a right to adopt it; but he was not authorised to an act which appeared to him a surrender of their liberties:—that as a representative of a free State, he thought he was bound in honour, to vote according to his idea of her true interest, and that he should do the same in similar circumstances."
Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,1/7/1788,"from the Dependent Chronicle, Of the year 1796, January the first. The sessions of the State Convention, which was called to make alterations in the Constitution of the Commonwealth,1 ended last week.—When it was, by a great majority, agreed—That the Commonwealth shall cease to exist, and that the Senators and Representatives of the same, now in Congress, shall surrender the Sovereignty, and Government, to his Excellency the President of the United States, who is most humbly solicited from this time forward, to assume, and take upon himself, the stile, title and dignity of KING OF ALL AMERICA—And that as Despotism was long since proved by a learned Sage of the law in Philadelphia, to be the best of all Governments,2 that his now Royal Majesty be vested with the most unlimitted and ample powers. We his most dutiful and loyal subjects, most humbly hoping, that for his own sake he will spare the lives of as many of us as he thinks proper.—And we earnestly recommend it to the pious Clergymen of the late Commonwealth, that they will as earnestly pray for his life and happiness, as they did in the year 1787, pray and strive for that new Constitution, which has been the sole cause of this happy Revolution. His most gracious Majesty has been pleased to publish his benign, and benevolent Proclamation, offering a bounty of One Thousand Eagles to any person, who will apprehend and bring to conviction the author of the following rebellious, insurge[n]tical and inflammatory Libel. “In a cave on the Banks of the Huron———” “THUS concealed, I will dare to engrave on the bark of the tree, the measures which lead my country blindfolded into slavery.” “When Britain extended the wand of oppression over the New World, Patriotism, enlightned by Science, and urged by Valor, contended until the price of Liberty was won, and secured.—The multitude of the people too ready, at times, to embrace licentiousness for liberty, become ungovernable, the sacred Courts of justice were prostrated, the sacred Rights of Men were violated, and Property, that grand object of human exertion, become insecure. There were at that time waiting for this epocha, a set of men who had opposed the then late Revolution; with high address they called to their aid, the affrighted Misers, the ambitious military Men who thought themselves not rewarded for their past toil and danger, the Lawyers, whose fees had become doubtful, and the Men of desperate commerce, who sought a momentary ease in the change of politics; with these they formed ideas in the minds of the people, repugnant to every sentiment of Republicanism.” When the United States had appointed a Convention for the express purpose of strengthening and giving efficacy to the Confederation and Union of the Thirteen Confederated Republics, this Convention reported, and the infatuated people adopted, what was called the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.—Is it not strange, that this solicism of expression was not attended to!—A Constitution must always mean a Form of Government for a sovereign, independent State; but a Constitution for States, either implies nothing at all, or that their separate Sovereignty ceases, and they are consolidated.—A Constitution of Government for men, may do, because men, as such, may exist in a General Government; but one Constitution of Government for several States can never exist, because they are no longer separate States, after one Form of Government, and one coercive Power, applies indiscriminately to all.—But these distinctions were unhappily lost in the noise of Lawyers, and the clamour of Partizans. This unlucky Constitution contained a clause of Judiciary Power, which provided, that there should be one Supreme Judicial Court, over the United States, and Inferiour Courts in each State. This Supreme Court was to have original jurisdiction of many public causes, appellate jurisdiction of all causes of law and equity, arising under that Constitution and the laws of the United States, and to all causes between citizens of different States, and between subjects of foreign States, and citizens of the United States. The chicane of Lawyers, by making nominal pla[i]ntiffs and defendants, who lived in other States, and the removal of citizens from one State to another, threw all the business into Courts of Congress, the Lawyers emoluments were rendered more certain, and enlarged, the power of the Courts of Congress encreased from day to day, while those [638]of the separate States diminished proportionably.—The Congress having an unlimitted controul over imposts, excises and taxes, left each State without revenue to support, a civil list. Their Governours and Judges were at length made of men, who either accepted authority to yield it for a price to the general Government, or of men too weak and unlearned to oppose the overflowing encroachments of Congress. A few Patriots yet dared to advocate the freedom of the people, but they were thrown into prison by state warrants; the grand jurors had courage enough in some States to indict the High Officers of Government, and the petit jurors had firmness enough to convict them; but, the President pardoned his servant, his ministers of justice. Actions of tre[s]pass were brought by the sufferers; but as the Constitution had provided that the Judges of the United States should, in civil actions, have cognizance both as to law and fact, the trial by jury was excluded; and these sufferers had to pay costs to the Tyrants who had oppressed them.—I the writer, though now white with age, was, at that time, in the vigour of manhood; and contended for a trial by jury, as the sacred Palladium of Liberty.—I produced the former complaints of Congress in their addresses to the King, of his taking away the trial by jury, and of his establishing on these principles a Government in Canada.—I shewed the addresses of Congresses and Courts to the people on this point; and urged, in vain, to the distracted and depraved people, the blood which had been expended for that Freedom, which, without this priviledge, is all but vanity and a lie. It was not then foreseen, by many who loved their country, that giving this judicial power, implicitly extended the legislative powers of Congress to all the objects within the juditial circle.—Hence arose a power of legislation for the mode of inheritances, for limitation of actions, and for the government of all property, for the High Court of the Union could not be controuled by laws of separate States, which were stript of all their sovereignty, and reduced to mere Corporations; even Probate Courts were rendered useless, because the division of dead mens estates, were commonly to be made between heirs and creditors who lived in different States. These strong observations might have wrested the progress of this Monster of Slavery, but its advocates answered them all, by saying, Congress must be trusted, and Congress would do right,—In vain it was urged, that such arguments proved too much—they proved all Constitutions and checks in Government to be unnecessary.—For if the Congress could be trusted with unlimitted power in these important points, why not in all things? Oh, my countrymen! it might well be said to you, “whom GOD intends to destroy, he first bereaves of Reason.”3 Thus overloaded with business, and gorged with jurisdiction, this Court became too bloated to go to the extensive circuit of all America; they were therefore only seen at the city of Congress, the Lawyers of Eminence all resided there, and were crouched to by pettyfoggers of distant Districts.—The effects of justice were felt by the remote Peasants of Massachusetts, in a very unjust manner; but the forms of justice were no more seen by them.—In fine, ignorance pervaded all ranks of men, the light of science blessed but a few, and these were demagogues of course; all now became impatient for one change more to gain ease, and they are easily perswaded that Despotism, according to Judge M’Kean, is the best of all possible Governments. It is said, the writer of the above Libel is fled to the kingdom of Spain for protection, as there is no trace of Liberty in lost America."
Letter,Yes,Thomas B. Wait,George Thatcher,,,1/8/1788,"My dear friend— Your kind letter of the 23d ultimo receiv’d.— My opposition to the proposed plan of Continental Govt. does not, as you suppose, arise from “violence of passion.”— On reception of the Report of the Convention, I perused, and admired it:—Or rather, like many who still think they admire it, I loved Geo. Washington—I venerated Benj. Franklin—and therefore concluded that I must love and venerate all the works of their hands:—This, if you please my friend, was “violence of passion”—and to this very violence of passion will the proposed Constitution owe its adoption—i.e.—should the people ever adopt it. The honest and uninformed freemen of America entertain the same opinion of those two gentlemen as do European slaves of their Princes,—“that they can do no wrong”— On the unprecedented Conduct of the Pennsylvania Legislature, I found myself disposed to lend an ear to the arguments of the opposition—not with an expectation of being convinced that the new Constitution was defective; but because I thought the minority had been ill used; and I felt a little curious to hear the particulars. The address of the Seceders2 was like the Thunder of Sinai—it’s lightnings were irresistable; and I was obliged to acknowledge, not only that the conduct of the majority was highly reprehensible, but that the Constitution itself might possibly be defective.—My mind has since been open to conviction—I have read & heard every argument, on either side, with a degree of candour, of which I never, on any other occasion, felt myself possessed—And, after this cool and impartial examination I am constrained—I repeat it, my dear friend—I am constrained to say, that I am dissatisfied with the proposed Constitution.— Your arguments against the necessity of a Bill of Rights are ingenious; but, pardon me my friend, they are not convincing.—You have traced the origin of a Bill of Rights accurately.—The People of England, as you say, undoubtedly made use of a Bill of Rights to obtain their rights and liberties of their soverigns; but is this an argument to prove that [646]they ought not now to make use of Bills in defence of those liberties?—shall a man throw away his sword, and refuse to defend a piece of property, for no other reason than that his property was obtained by that very sword?—Bills of Rights have been the happy instruments of wresting the privileges and rights of the people from the hand of Despotism; and I trust God that Bills of Rights will still be made use of by the people of America to defend them against future encroachments of despotism—Bills of Rights, in my opinion, are the grand bulwarks of freedom. But, say you, some however necessary in state Constitutions, there car be; no necessity for a Bill of Rights in the Continental plan of Govt.—because every Right is reserved that is not expressly given up—Or, in other words, Congress have no powers but those expressly given by that Constitution.—This is the doctrine of the celebrated Mr. Wilson;3 and as you, my friend, have declared it orthodox, be so good as to explain the meaning of the following Extracts from the Constitution-Art. I Sect. 9.—“The privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended &c.”—“No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.”—“No money shall be drawn from the treasury’ &c.—“No title of nobility shall be granted by the United states.”—Now, how absurd—how grosly absurd is all this, if Congress, in reality, have no powers but those particularly specified in the Constitution!— It will not do, my friend—for God’s sake let us not deny self-evident propositions—let us not sacrifice the truth, that we may establish a favourite hypothesis;—in the present case, the liberties and happiness of a world may also be sacrificed.— There is a certain darkness, duplicity and studied ambiguity of expression runing thro’ the whole Constitution which renders a Bill of Rights peculiarly necessary.—As it now stands but very few individuals do, or ever will understand it.—Consequently, Congress will be its own interpreter—The article respecting taxation and representation is neither more or less than a puzling Cap; and you, my friend, had the pleasure of wearing it, at my office, an hour or two—and then pulled it off, just as Wise as when you put it on.—But you will now perhaps tell me that you can explain it entirely to my satisfaction—possibly you can; but that may not happen completely to satisfy Congress—if it should not, why they will put a different one,—one that may not satisfy either you or me—But Some persons have guessed the meaning to be this—that taxation and presentation should be in proportion to all the freemen and slaves in each state—counting five of the latter to three of the former—If these were the ideas of the Convention, what a strange collection of words do we find in the Constitution to express them!—Who, in the name of God, but [647]the majority of that honl. body, would ever have tho’t of expressing like ideas in like words!—But bad as may be the mode of expression, the ideas, in my opinion, are worse— By this interpretation the article in question is an egregious imposition on the northern states—Tell me, if you can, why a southern negro, in his present debased condition, is any more intitled to representation, than a northern Bullock?—Both are mere pieces of property—and nothing more!—The latter is equally a free agent with the former.— O, for that social Evening you so kindly wish for!—I want prodigeously to see you:—But it grieves me that we do not think alike—You will, my dear Thatcher, I know you will alter your opinion—And I charitably conclude The only reason why you had not done it when you wrote me, was, that owing to the small pox, you had not attended to the arguments of the opposition.4— And now let me beseech you not obstinately to defend your present notions of the new Constitution tho’ they may be all the ton in the great world, till you have examined every argument that has been used against it—pay particular attention to the Debates of the Pennsylvania Convention;5 and I am certain that you must acknowledge if the Constitution is good, that it by no means appears so from any arguments made use of by the majority of that body—they are lighter than straws.— How can you, after perusing the arguments of Crazy Jonathan,6 approve of the abolition of juries in civil causes—If the Genl. Court of this state are insurgents for depriving the subject of that right in 110 actions out of 120—what shall we say to the Constitution that evidently deprives the subject of that right altogether?—O, my good friend, that cursed Small pox has made a crazy Jonathan of you in good earnest.—But your life is spared—and I am happy— Last Saturday week I did myself the pleasure of visiting your dear wife and family—and tarried till Monday noon—it was a godly season—had you been present, it had been a Paradise.— Mrs. Thatcher shew’d me your P.S. wherein you charge all who do not think as you do with sorcery, witch craft, &c.—It pain’d me to the soul—I wanted to shed a tear; and had no one been present, I should certainly have given vent to a dozen—I wish, said I, to Mrs. T. that your good husband and myself could think alike—I wish, replied she, that I had not shewn you the P.—S.—or rather that you had agreed to think alike before you parted—or, added Tempy,7 that Uncle was now present to settle the difference—We all joined most heartily in the last wish—we almost made a prayer of it; but it. was not heard—perhaps we did not ask in faith—Be this as it might—Politicks, from that moment, was [648]consigned over to the wind, and not a soul of us would even lend an ear to its whistling.… We continued as perfectly happy as was possible in the absence of our friend, our Uncle and our father, until Sunday noon;—at which time Jeremiah Hill, Esq. made his appearance—from that time till after tea, (which we drank at his house) we eat and drank and talked politicks. The Squire, you must know, is a professed Constitutionalist—Silas8 and myself were Anti’s—so we had nothing to do but fall at it hammer & tones,—Had you been within hearing, you would have wished the new Constitution, or its advocate, or both, at the Devil—We roasted him—we basted him, till he became quite a crisp; and, had we tarried the evening, we should certainly have devoured him—We took pity upon, and left him directly after tea—returned to your house, and were again happy.… You say nothing of a Post to Pownalboro’—The people at the Eastward are amazingly impatient—It is an important period; and they are almost totally ignorant of every public transaction—Five Delegates in six, from these three Counties are opposed to the new plan of Cont. Government—Genl. Thompson and your Brother Widgery are warm in the opposition, and both are Conventioners9— Mr. Barnard’s Contract for the year 1787,—hath expired—The Postmaster Genl. has not renewed it for 1788—’tho’ applied to by Mr. B.—We Therefore have no Post from Portsmoth to this place—Mr. Barnard rides or letteth it alone, as he pleaseth.—Mr. Freeman is very uneasy on this account; and joins with me in requesting you to see the P. Mastr Genl. and to enquire into the matter—We are barbarously neglected, my friend.— Your friend foever— P.S.—your papers are sent weekly, sealed, directed, &c.—I am surprised that you have not recivd them.…"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/8/1788,"To the PEOPLE. My last Address1 contained the outlines of a system fully adequate to all the useful purposes of the union. Its object is to raise a sufficient revenue from the foreign trade, and the sale of our publick lands, to satisfy all the publick exegencies, and to encourage, at the same time, our internal industry and manufactures. It also secures each state in its own separate rights, while the continental concerns are thrown into the general department. The only deficiencies that I have been able to discover in the plan, and in the view of federalists they are very great ones, are, that it does not allow the interference of Congress in the domestick concerns of the state and that it does not render our national councils so liable to foreign influence. The first of these articles tends to guard us from that infinite multiplication of officers which the report of the Convention of Philadelphia proposes. With regard to the second, it is evidently not of much importance to any foreign nation to purchase, at a very high price, a majority of votes in an assembly, whose members are continually exposed to a recall. But give those members a right to sit six, or even two, years, with such extensive powers as the new system proposes, and their friendship will be well worth a purchase. This is the only sense in which the Philadelphia system will render us more respectable in the eyes of foreigners. In every other view they lose their respect for us, as it will render us more like their own degraded models. It is a maxim with them, that every man has his price. If therefore we were to judge of what passes in the hearts of the federalists when they urge us, as they continually do, to be like other nations, and when they assign mercenary motives to the opposers of their plan, we should conclude very fairly, that themselves wish to be provided for at the publick expense. However that may be if we look upon the men, we shall find some of their leaders to have formed pretty strong attachments to foreign nations. Whether those attachments arose from their being educated under a royal government, from a former unfortunate mistake in politicks, or from the agencies for foreigners, or any other cause, is not in my province to determine. But certain it is, that some of the principal fomenters of this plan have never shewn themselves capable of that generous system of policy which is founded in the affections of freemen. Power and high life are their idols, and national funds are necessary to support them. Some of the principal powers of Europe have already entered into treaties with us, and that some of the rest have not done it, is not owing, as is falsely pretended, to the want of power in Congress. Holland never found any difficulty of this kind from the multitude of sovereignties in that country, which must all be consulted on such an occasion. The resentment of Great Britain for our victories in the late war has induced that power to restrain our intercourse with their subjects. Probably an hope, the only solace of the wretched, that their affairs would take a more favourable turn on this continent, has had some influence on their proceedings. All their restrictions have answered the end of securing our independence by driving us into many valuable manufactures. Their own colonies in the mean time have languished for want of an intercourse with these states. The new settlement in Nova-Scotia has miserably decayed, and the West-India islands have suffered for want of our supplies, and by the loss of our market. This has affected the revenue; and however contemptuously some men may affect to speak of our trade, the supply of six millions of people is an object worth the attention of any nation upon earth. Interest in such a nation as Britain will surmount their resentment. However their pride may be stung, they will pursue after wealth. Increase of revenue to a nation over whelmed with a debt of near two hundred and ninety millions sterling is an object to which little piques must give way; and there is no doubt that their interest consists in securing as much of our trade as they can. These are topicks from which are drawn some of the most plausible reasons that have been given by the federalists in favour of their plan, as derived from the sentiments of foreigners. We have weighed them and found them wanting. That they had not themselves full confidence in their own reasons at Philadelphia is evident from the method they took to bias the state Convention. Mess’rs Wilson and M’Kean, two Scottish names, were repeatedly worsted in the argument. To make amends for their own incapacity, the gallery was filled with a rabble, who shouted their applause, and these heroes of aristocracy were not ashamed, though modesty is their national virtue, to vindicate such a violation of decency2 Means not less criminal, but not so flagrantly indecent, have been frequently mentioned among us to secure a majority?’. But those who vote for a price, can never sanctify wrong, and treason will still retain its deformity."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/9/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, In the preceding numbers it has been shewn, that the original design of calling the federal convention has not been carried into effect—That they nevertheless reported a system of government with a professed intention of consolidating the union—That they had not the least publick authority to discuss, much less to decide this great question—That neither Congress or the Legislatures have been disposed to express any opinion on the new system—That although they were constitutionally restrained from deciding, yet they had a right at any time, to have agitated and considered the question, to have explained it to the people, and to have recommended their electing State Conventions to have taken up the matter—That had this been done, the people would have had every necessary information, and probably have united in some salutary measure—That they are now without that information, and by the mode of conducting this matter, are thrown into great confusion—That a party spirit prevails, and is daily increasing—That in the present temper of the people, it will not restore peace or tranquility to reject the system, or to ratify it with or without the delusive prospect of future alterations—That if accepted in its present form, there is not a probability of supporting it—and that amendments are indispensibly necessary, in order to its adoption.—These are facts which if any one doubts, will I think, clearly appear when we consider the system itself. The revolution which separated the United States from Great-Britain, was not more important to the liberties of America, than that which will result from the adoption of the new system. The former freed us from a foreign subjugation, and there is too much reason to apprehend, that the latter will reduce us to a federal domination. Had the Convention thought proper, merely to have formed the plan, and to have sent it to Congress, and the legislatures, the consequences would not have been so serious, as from their accompanying it with the following resolutions.—“Resolved,1 That the preceeding Constitution be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, and that it is the opinion of this Convention, that it should afterwards be submitted to a Convention of Delegates chosen in each state by the PEOPLE thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification, and that [662]each Convention, assenting to and ratifying the same, should give notice thereof to the United States in Congress assembled.” “Resolved, That it is the opinion of the Convention, that as soon as the Conventions of nine States shall have ratified the Constitution, the United Suites in Congress assembled shall fix a day on which electors should be appointed by the States which shall have ratified the same, and a day on which the electors should assemble to vote for the President, and the time and place for commencing proceedings under this Constitution: That after such publication, the electors should be appointed, and the Senators and Representatives elected: That the electors should meet on the day fixed for the election of the President; and should transmit their votes, certified, signed, sealed and directed, as the Constitution requires, to the secretary of the United States in Congress assembled, that the Senators and Representatives should convene at the time and place assigned—That the Senators should appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole purpose of receiving, opening and counting the votes for President, and that after he shall be chosen, the congress together with the President, should without delay, proceed to execute this Constitution.” In consequence of these resolutions of the federal convention, Congress “Resolved, That the Constitution so reported be transmitted to the several legislatures, in order to be submitted to a Convention of Delegates, chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the said Convention in that case made and provided”—and in pursuance thereof, the legislature of this State resolved, “That it be, and it is hereby recommended to the people of this Commonwealth, that a Convention of Delegates be chosen agreeably to and for the purposes mentioned in the resolution of Congress aforesaid.[”]—It is evident, therefore, that the proposed Constitution is, agreeably to the recommendation of the federal Convention, submitted to the State Convention, that is, to a majority of its members, for their assent and ratification. Should the plan be adopted by this and eight other States, every part of the Constitution of this Commonwealth which is contrary to the new Constitution, to the laws that may he made in pursuance thereof or to treaties of the United States, will be null and void: for the plan expressly provides, that “this Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to contrary notwithstanding—And will not such a subjection of the Constitution of this Commonwealth, not only to the Constitution, but to the law of the union, and to treaties, that are or may be made under the [663]authority of Congress, be in effect, a DISSOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS? Surely it will. Mr. Locke, in his treatise of civil government, chap. 19, in sect. 212,2 says, “Governments are dissolved from within, when the legislative is altered,” and in sect. 215, “for it is not a certain number of men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have also freedom of debating, and leisure of perfecting, what is for the good of the society, wherein the legislative consists: when these are taken away, or altered, so as to deprive the society of the due exercise of this power, the legislative is truly altered; for it is not names that constitute governments, but the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany them.3 What were the powers originally intended by the people of this State, to be used and exercised by their legislature, they are contained in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, part 2, chap. 1, sect. 1, under the head of “the legislative power,”4 qualified nevertheless by certain reservations in the Bill of Rights.5 Some of the most important of those powers will, by the new plan, be transferred to the federal government, and others be exercised by their permission. This, I presume, is too evident to be denied, and will hereafter more fully appear. Our government will then have the name that it now has, but not “the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany it.” Indeed, it is inconceivable, that a plan of consolidation can be established, without destroying the sovereignty of the respective States, and thus dissolving their present governments. But supposing the adoption of the new plan would only alter the Constitution of this State, by what mode should that alteration be made? Should it be effected pursuant to the recommendation of a federal Convention, and in direct violation of the Constitution of this State? or should the alteration be made consistently with the Constitution. itself? This expressly provides, “That, in order the more effectually to adhere to the principles of the Constitution, and to correct those violations which by any means may be made therein, as well as to form such alterations as from experience shall be found necessary, the General Court, which shall be in the year of our Lord 1795, shall issue precepts to the selectmen of the several towns, and to the assessors of the unincorporated plantations, directing them to convene the qualified voters of their respective towns and plantations for the purpose of collecting their sentiments on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution, in order to amendments: And if it. shall appear by the returns made, that two thirds of The qualified voters throughout the State, who shall assemble and vote in consequence of the said precepts, are in favour of such revision or amendment, the General Court shall issue precepts, or direct them to be issued, from the secretary’s office to the [664]several towns to elect delegates to meet in Convention, for the purpose aforesaid: The said delegates to be chosen in the same manner and proportion as their representatives,”6 &c.—Here we see, that, by the Constitution of this State in the year 1795, the sentiments of the qualified voters on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution, are to be collected, and if it shall then appear that two thirds of them are in favour of a revision and amendment, in that case only, is a Convention to be called for these purposes. Should it be a question, whether an alteration in the Constitution can be made before the year 1795, there is nothing in the clause recited, that I can conceive to prevent it: because although in the year 1795, precepts must issue for the purposes mentioned, there is no provision to prevent their issuing, if necessary, before that period. But surely, if any alteration should be made in the Constitution, it must be in a mode provided by the Constitution itself for otherwise the clause recited must become a nullity, which is inadmissible, or, which is the same thing, the Constitution itself must be violated. Of all compacts, a Constitution or frame of Government, is the most solemn and important, and should be strictly adhered to. The object of it is the preservation of that property, which every individual of the community has, in his life, liberty and estate:7 Every measure therefore, that only approaches to an infraction of such a covenant, ought to be avoided, because it will injure that sacred regard to the Constitution which should be deeply impressed on the minds of the whole community—How much more careful then should we be to avoid an open violation of such a compact! Such a violation must take place, if a majority, or every member of the Convention, should vote for an acceptance of the new Constitution, because a Convention cannot be called for altering, much less dissolving the government Massachusetts, before the sentiments of the qualified voters are collected on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution in order to amendment, and two thirds of them shall be in favour of the measure. A ratification, therefore of the new Constitution by the State Convention, cannot be binding on the citizens of this State, being directly repugnant to an existing covenant. But suppose such a ratification should be supported by a majority of the Convention and of the citizens of this State: What must be the consequence of thus destroying all publick faith and confidence? Are not these the principles that bind and cement the community, and that establish them as a body politick? Are they not the foundation of a free Government? If every individual by such a measure, should have his nth and confidence in the honour and integrity of the community effectually destroyed, (and this must inevitably be the consequence) will he not decline entering into such a nugatory compact in future, [665]or entering into it, will he not disregard it as a mere matter of form, and rather than he at any pains or expense to support it, suffer it to share the fate of the other? Certainly he will, and instead of a government founded in compact, we must hereafter be content with one founded in fraud or force."
Newspaper,No,Samuel,,Independent Chronicle,,1/10/1788,"Mess’rs Adams & Nourse, By inserting the following in your paper, you will gratify some of your Readers, and I hope not disserve the Public. I was at first in favour of the proposed national Constitution’s taking place: But when I noticed the following thing in it, I cannot wish to have it adopted, unless I could be convinced that I am herein altogether mistaken. For by looking in said Constitution, Art. I, Sect. 2.—I find that the number of Representatives from each State, and direct taxes, are ostensively both fixed on the same basis, viz.—The numbers—But when it comes to apportion the Representatives, to the several States, it diverges extremely wide from that basis; as appears by the Continental tax, which issued from the Congress nearly the same time.2 According to which, Georgia (as in said Constitution apportioned) is represented six fold Rhode-Island; more than five Massachusetts; nearly five Connecticut.—Connecticut pays more tax than York; yet York sends most Representatives. The mean number in said tax, for sending a Representative, in the New-England States, is in comparison with the mean number in all the rest, nearly as 5 to 4. For the mean number of said tax, in the New-England States, to send a Representative, is 29,447 dollars. In all the rest of the States, it is but 24,996 dollars. Or if we take the lumbers, according to the last enumeration I find extant, it will stand about as 7 to 6. For the mean number of persons in the New-England States, to send a Representative, is 42,941.—In all the rest of the States, it is but 36,666. But some perhaps will say, Georgia is a growing State, and has increased, since said enumeration. ’Tis likely they are increased, since that enumeration: But the tax was about the same time of the Constitution; and the disproportion by the tax, as to Georgia, is nearly the same, as by that old enumeration. But suppose Georgia is increased, since said old enumeration; perhaps no one will pretend the other States have grown less; if they have in numbers, they have not in taxes, in proportion to Georgia. But the other States have not their proportion of Representatives, according to said old enumeration. These Representatives are to set their own wages, to be paid out of the Continental Treasury; therefore the New-England States will have to pay nearly every fifth dollar, to support Representatives in the other States, according to the apportionment in said Constitution. I at first flattered myself, that this inequality would be remedied, when the actual enumeration is made. But on further notice found my mistake that there is no prospect of its being better, but worse. For tho’ [679]the Constitution says, that the Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States, according to their respective numbers; yet it says, they shall not exceed one for every 30,000: But does not say, we may have one for every 30,000; and it cannot rationably be supposed, that it is designed it ever should be so. For they have not set out so, by a very great proportion: For allowing every State its one Representative for every 30,000, according to said old enumeration, and throwing away the fractional parts of 30,000, in each State, would make thirteen more Representatives in the whole; and six of those thirteen, would be in the New-England States, almost half of what is left out; yet those four States, send but about a quarter, as now apportioned. Yet Georgia is allowed to send three times as many as the proportion which the Constitution says it shall not exceed. And if such strides are made now, while we are invited to accept of it, we may fully conclude that if once we should adopt it, these four States, which are now so far reduced below par, would be reduced to no more than one Representative to each State; and therein would not stride the letter of the Constitution, as they have now, in the case of Georgia: For it would not transgress the letter of the Constitution at all, to reduce any State or States they please, to one Representative each. And they may, as well as what is done now in the case of Georgia, exaggerate the number of Representatives, in any other State to what number they please; and we should have to maintain them, at any price they shall please to lay upon us. And this would serve, not only to secure an over-bearing ballance in the House of Representatives, when the Congress please, against any State or States; but also the choice of the President and Vice-President, to any favourite party of States, that the Congress shall think proper. For the number of electors, and the number of Senators and Representatives, are always to be equal in each State. For the satisfaction of all who would be curious to know, the following Fable shows the number of dollars, each State pays in said tax, and the number of persons, according to said enumeration, to one Representative. Dollars.	Persons to a Representative. New-Hampshire, pays 19,894 and has 33,333 Massachusetts, 31,779 43,750 Rhode-Island,	36,558	60,000 Connecticut, 29,995 44,000 New-York, 24,299 33,333 New-Jersey, 23,593 30,000 Pennsylvania,29,07743,750 Delaware, pays 25,506 and has 45,000 Maryland, 26,724 36,666 Virginia, 29,077 40,000 North-Carolina, 24,690 40,000 South-Carolina, 21,799 40,000 Georgia, And the whole of the purse, and of the sword, is put into the hands of the President, and a Congress so unequal, and which also may consist, of men of no principle or property. For no religion or property is required, as any qualification, to fill any and every seat in the Legislative, Judicial and Executive departments, in the whole nation. That a Pagan, a Mahometan, a Bankrupt, may fill the highest seat, and any and every seat; nothing but age and residence, are required, as qualifications, for the most important trusts. And there is nothing to hinder their keeping a standing army, at all times, peace or war. Nor is there any provision made for the people or States, to petition or remonstrate, let their grievances be what they will. Should Massachusetts, for instance, be reduced to one Representative, it cannot complain, but is liable to be construed into sedition and rebellion; and the standing army employed to suppress it; as the British standing army were to subdue America. And there is nothing to hinder, but ample provision made, for Congress to make themselves perpetual. For by Art. I, Sect. 4. the Congress may at any time, make and alter the time, place and manner of choosing Representatives; and the time and manner of choosing Senators. They may also make the President, and Vice-President perpetual; or he, the President, may make himself so, by the help of a little more than a sixth part of the Congress. For the Congress are to appoint the time, and place of choosing the electors, and the day of their giving their votes. Art. II. Sect. 1st. paragraph 4. And if the Congress don’t see cause to appoint a time and day for those purposes, there can be none chosen, the old ones continue; or if the majority of the Quorum, appoint the time and day for choosing the electors, and of their giving their votes, the President may so far negative it, as that there must be two thirds of both Houses to make it valid; and the standing army they may keep in time of peace, they may canton where they please, to suppress any complaints that may arise by oppression, or loss of rights or privileges. And thus also, they may exempt themselves, and all their dependants from all taxation; not only Continental, but State taxation, laying heavy burdens on others, and not move them with one of their fingers. How [681]then will they represent the people? For it is essential to a Representative that he feels all the burdens he lays on the community he is to represent. This is not a mere chimera, for the Constitution appears evidently calculated, to swallow up all State government and authority. For tho’ there is frequent mention made of State Legislatures; yet they have no power or authority, as plainly hinted in several places, but very expressly declared, article VI, paragraph 2d, “This Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby; any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.” This is a bold and decisive stroke, whereby all State authority is at once absorbed, or annihilated; and especially when considered in connection with article III, Sec. 2d. “The Judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made” &c. But there is no provision made for any tryal by Jury, except in criminal cases, and how they are to be packed we don’t know. And the President with two thirds of the Senators present, is to make those omnipotant treaties. Art. III. Sect. 2d, which are to supercede all State laws, and which may be, to cede any part of the territory, to a foreign Prince, to hire him to guarantee to him the President to be the sole absolute despot of the rest; or any other purposes he pleases. And this two thirds of the members present, may consist of no more than two persons; for there is no quorum affixed to them, only in their Legislative capacity.3 But make the best we can of it, and apply the Legislative quorum here, it will require no more than the Senators of five States, viz. ten Senators, to make any treaties the President pleases; which may affect the territory, laws or commerce, of some States to advantage; at the expence, or to the prejudice of other States; or even to the giving up some States, to a foreign Prince, as before suggested. The most complaints, that I have heard made about the proposed Constitution, are that there is no declaration of rights. In the confederation, there is a declaration of rights, of the contracting parties, viz. The several States.4 But here is none, either of States or of people. And we by this time see the reason of that omission, viz. because there are no rights left, either to the States or people; and it would have been inconsistent to have attempted any thing of that kind; or declared any rights remaining, after all was given up claimed by this Constitution. But some have supposed, they have a salvo for all difficulties, that may arise in said Constitution, by the 5th Art. entitled amendments provided, But all amendments are effectually guarded against in the next [682]Art. paragraph 3. For there we find, all the members of Congress, and all the members of the several State Legislatures, and all the Executive and Judicial officers, both of the United States, and of the several States, are to be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution. How then can we have any amendments, as speciously pretended in said 5th Article? When all those from whom only it can originate, are to be bound by oath, to support this as it is. Besides, it is not likely, that the President, or Congress, would be so impolitic, as to oppress so large a proportion of the States at once, as two thirds; therefore, there is no probability, and scarcely possibility, that ever a motion of two thirds should arise. Moreover, could we obtain a Convention, and by them amendments proposed; they might lie dormant forever, if the Congress did not see cause to appoint how the amendments should be ratified; which is not to be expected, if the amendments should be to diminish their power; so that all the parade about amendments, comes to nothing. But to return to the oath; there is something very singular in the manner of the oath; that all Continental and State officers, should be bound by oath, to preserve, protect, defend and support this Constitution. And not rather be under oath, to preserve, protect, defend and support the United States, or the people thereof, in their rights and privileges; it may from this no doubt be expected that Proclamations will conclude GOD SAVE THE CONSTITUTION! In the same paragraph, in which the above oath is instituted, all religion is expressly rejected, from the Constitution. Was there ever any State or kingdom, that could subsist, without adopting some system of religion? Not so much as to own the being, and government of a Deity; or a any acknowledgment of him! or having any revelation from him! Should we adopt such a rejection of religion as this, the words of Samuel lo Saul, will literally apply to us,—Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.5 We may justly expect, that God will reject us, from that self government, we have obtained thro’ his divine interposition: Or being able to keep up government and order among us; for he has commanded the rulers of the earth, to kiss the son, lest he be angry, and they perish from the way.6 If civil rulers won’t acknowledge God, he won’t acknowledge them; and hey must perish from the way. And there can be no rational doubt, that the prevailing neglect of acknowledging God in the time of the revolution, and since, is the cause of our having such convulsions as have been among us; we are perishing from the way. Again, I find, in the last acts of the Constitution, that it is an open professed resolution, to break a solemn covenant, made by the several States in the confederation of the United States of America. Which having [683]named the States, in the 3d. article, says “the said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship, with each other, for their common defence, &c.”—Then going on to describe this firm league, till it comes to the last Art. it concludes, “And the articles of this Confederation, shall be inviolably observed by every State; and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to, in Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State.” But this new Constitution, does not appear to be agreed to by Congress, neither is it a Confederation of the States; but professedly of the people, as in the very first words of it; and concludes, that [“]the ratification of the conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution, between the States so ratifying the same.” This is expressly repugnant to the Confederation, the sacred national covenant we are under; and to set up a schism in the nation. This is not proposed to be done by the same contracting parties. For that was a covenant of union between the States. This is to be by the people of the States, to throw off all their allegiance to the federal Constitution of the nation, and the covenant Constitutions of the several States, And if the conventions in nine States will adopt it, then to separate, and set up this in violation of all covenant obligations, of the most solemn important kind and consequence. But almost every one is possessed with a persuasion, that some farther powers are necessary to be vested in the National Head, the Congress; perhaps I am as strongly possessed of that apprehension as any one; therefore, at first, I felt passive, or rather inclined that this Constitution should be adopted, not considering the nature of it. But why should we break such a solemn covenant, as this Constitution resolves to do? And plunge ourselves into such a labyrinth of innovation, which it is impossible for any one to fore-see, or perhaps to guess where it will land us, or what we shall meet by the way? This Constitution does not wear the complexion of uniting the nation—but of dividing it. Had we not much better keep on our old ground? The national covenant we are under, solemnly ratified to be perpetual, and amend that: It is, no doubt, as easy to amend that, as it will be to amend the new one. And this I understand, was the sole purpose the federal Convention was appointed for, viz. To revise the articles of confederation, not to destroy the covenant. Why should we be fond of another revolution so soon? Why should we be fond of such an innovation? Let us hear what a sage old politician, once said on a similar occasion, after having described to the people, the nature and consequence of the innovation, they were [684]urging for, says, Ye shall cry out in that day, because of your King, which ye have chosen you: and the LORD will not hear you.7"
Newspaper,No,Helvidius Priscus,,Independent Chronicle,The Raising of the First Three Pillars to the Federal Superstructure,1/10/1788,"To the PUBLIC. The three pillars2 lately erected at the southward, are like the hanging towers of Pisa, to be proped up and cemented by the blood of posterity, if ever they stand at all; for the present generation have too strong a sense of the rights of nature, of the sufferings experienced for their re-establishment, to set down passively under a tottering pile, erected on pillars of porcelain—and if half a dozen others should yet be added to the guilded dome, it will still be astonishingly defective; as the artificers have hurried it through for their own present accommodation, without one solid heart of oak to support an edifice, whose wings extend to embrace the territory from the Mississippi, to the chain of lakes, and from the inland seas to the eastern shore.—An ancient [685page icon]historian has left it on record, that the first monarch after the Achœan league, who gained an entire influence over their councils, was possessed of all the virtues that endear a king—“A lively genius, an uncommon understanding, an happy memory, an agreeable utterance, an unaffected grace in all his actions—He possessed a beautiful aspect, heightened by a majestic air, which bespoke the greatness of his mind, but his brightest virtues were the sweetness of his temper, his affability and great desire to please and content all who were under his government.”—But alas! he was a man—he was a king—and let America be admonished, that in the plentitude of uncontrouled power, the same historian adds, that he forfeited this great character, and from a glorious king became an inhuman tyrant. Mankind have always been lulled by sounds into a fatal security, without giving themselves the trouble of investigation. Yet it is not probable the metaphisical disquisitions of a southern doctor,3 will persuade the world that the majority of the late CONVENTION were so much the peculiar favourites of heaven as to receive an immediate inspiration for the model of a government, that should subjugate a country which appears to those who are really religious, and who believe in a providential direction, to have been remarkably under divine protection in the various steps that led to its independence. But why was the small minority (who could not in conscience accede) denied their share in this heavenly illumination?—and why was the aged Dr. Franklin, so darkened in his councils, as to make a motion that the President should have no sallary?4 and to oppose almost every article in the system till the last, when he lent his signature in tears?5 or were those tears the result of a late revelation, that the system was fairly deduced from heaven; though it might involve America, first in anarchy, and then in despotism. But the men who have denied the authenticity of the decalogue, and perhaps the divine origin of the gospel, may sport with the credulity of mankind—and droll on the miraculous interpositions of heaven, under an appearance of an enthusiasm for truth, if it will operate to the completion of a favourite system, while yet the honour of the gentleman is secure from falshood, when he asserts that he believes “the finger of God was as much employed in fabricating the fœderal republic as in dictating the ten commandments; and that the divine origin of the new system is as much the object of his faith, as the division of the red sea, or the fulmination of the law from Mount Sina.”6 But as the gentlemen of the medical faculty have not all of them been the most remarkable advocates for divine inspiration; or the most distinguished in vindicating the sacred oracles of religion, we are glad if the learned Doctor Rush is an exception. If he has really a sober sense of divine dispensation, it is to be regreted that a man of understanding should suffer his language to wear the guize of enthusiastic rant; But if he is one of the fashionable sceptical race, it is not strange when a darling point was to be urged, that he should indulge such epithets of impious affectation to fall from his lip, as shocks the feelings of those who revere the code of the supreme lawgiver. While the Roman usurper was ravaging Gaul, whenever it was convenient for their purposes, his commissioners consulted the Pagan oracles, and when the people were prepared by their love of pleasure, and prostration of principle, to bow to the yoke of servitude, he was pronounced from the lip of the Cybles, the destined master of the word; yet we do not find that Cæsar, though Pontifex Maximas or Curio, who was purchased by his gold, had either of them much religion, and when it became necessary for the purposes of the tyrant, a Claudius was found to get a law enacted that no regard should be paid to the denunciations of the augurs.7 But the augurs who profess a more perfect religion, without pretending to immediate inspiration, will venture to predict, that the characters of the respected minority in the grand convention, and the names of FINDLEY, SMILIE,8 and others in Pennsylvania, and a much longer list in the Massachusetts, instead of sinking into contempt, will stand distinguished in the annals of fame, for opposing with the magnanimity of genuine patriotism, a combination of ambitious spirits, exorbitant wealth or squandered fortune, of men of licentious principles, and heated imaginations, and of a few of more conscientious opinion, who from the early rudiments of education and manners, have always had a predilection in favour of arbitrary government. But in the exultation of party, let them not again in the convivial hour, toast the memory of the heroes who sacrificed their lives in defence of the liberties of America—least the pale spectres should appear as the evil genius of Brutus, and summon them to the shades, though not to die like he Phillippian Hero, in the last glorious struggle for freedom, but in the ignoble effort to consign posterity to the manacles of slavery."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/11/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, Suffer an individual to lay before you his contemplations on the great subject that now engages your attention. To you it belongs, and may Heaven direct your judgment, to decide on the happiness of all future generations as well as the present. It is universally agreed, that the object of every just government is to render the people happy, by securing their persons and possessions from wrong. To this end it is necessary that there should be local laws and institutions; for a people inhabiting various climates will unavoidably have local habits and different modes of life, and these must be consulted in making the laws. It is much easier to adapt the laws to the manners of the people, than to make manners conform to laws. The idle and dissolute inhabitants of the south, require a different regimen from the sober and active people of the north. Hence, among other reasons, is derived the necessity of local governments, who may enact, repeal, or alter regulations as the circumstances of each part of the empire may require. This would be the case, even if a very great state was to be settled at once. But it becomes still more needful, when the local manners are formed, and usages sanctified by the practice of a [695]century and an half. In such a case, to attempt to reduce all to one standard, is absurd in itself, and cannot be done but upon the principle of power, which debases the people, and renders them unhappy, till all dignity of character is put away. Many circumstances render us an essentially different people from the inhabitants of the southern states. The unequal distribution of property, the toleration of slavery, the ignorance and poverty of the lower classes, the softness of the climate, and dissoluteness of manners, mark their character. Among us, the care that is taken of education, small and nearly equal estates, equality of rights, and the severity of the climate, renders the people active, industrious and sober. Attention to religion and good morals is a distinguishing trait in our character. It is plain, therefore, that we require for our regulation laws, which will not suit the circumstances of our southern brethren, and that laws made for them would not apply to us. Unhappiness would be the uniform product of such laws; for no state can be happy, when the laws contradict the general habits of the people, nor can any state retain its freedom, while there is a power to make and enforce such laws. We may go further, and say, that it is impossible for any single legislature so fully to comprehend the circumstances of the different parts of a very extensive dominion, as to make laws adapted to those circumstances. Hence arises in most nations of extensive territory, the necessity of armies, to cure the defect of the laws. It is actually under the pressure of such an absurd government, that the Spanish provinces have groaned for near three centuries; and such will be our misfortune and degradation, if we ever submit to have all the business of the empire done by one legislature. The contrary principle of local legislation by the representatives of the people, who alone are to be governed by the laws, has raised us to our present greatness; and an attempt on the part of Great-Britain, to invade this right, brought on the revolution, which gave us a separate rank among the nations. We even declared, that we would not be represented in the national legislature, because one assembly was not adequate to the purposes of internal legislation and taxation. (Remainder next Tuesday.)"
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/12/1788,"Mr. Russell, A real Federalist wishes to be informed, whether granting to Congress the Impost for twenty-five years; empowering them fully to regulate trade for the said term of time, and to equalize the representation of the States, together with giving them the sole right of coining and emitting money, would not render the Confederation as compleat as could reasonably be expected, and answer the most important purposes of the Federal Government, without subjecting us to the inconveniences, dangers, and the enormous expense that will inevitably attend our adoption of the new system of national government."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/12/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, Every candid mind will by this time I think be clearly convinced, that if the constitution of this Commonwealth has any validity, the ratification of a plan that would alter, much less of one that would dissolve the government, cannot be valid, unless by a mode provided by the Constitution itself. There are but two modes, to my knowledge, wherein any alterations can be made: One [699]has been mentioned, and it has been fully shewn that the ratification of the new Constitution by the state Convention would be in direct violation of that mode, and therefore not binding on the citizens of this State.—Let us now consider the other mode. In addition to the political compact contained in the Constitution of this State, it is bound by another as solemn and more extensive, the articles of Confederation. By the first, the “whole people convenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people:”1 and by the last, [“]the whole of the States covenants with each State, and each State with the whole of the States,”2 and the powers in the articles of Confederation, expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled, are paramount to and annul every power of the State Constitution, that is inconsistent with and opposed to them.3 A mode is provided in the Confederation for amending it. in the words following, “and the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State of the union, shall be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them unless such alterations be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.”4 A correspondent provision is made in the fourth article of the Bill of Rights of our State Constitution—(vide Constitution of Massachusetts)5 the exercise then of every power, jurisdiction and right, which is or may hereafter be by the people thus expressly delegated, is clearly relinquished on their part and will be binding on them. Had the federal Convention reported and Congress agreed to alterations in the articles of Confederation, there could I think have been no doubt, that the ratification of such alterations by the legislature would have been as binding on the people as if made by themselves, because in the article mentioned of the bill of rights, the people have recognized the articles of Confederation, which on the part of the State were ratified, pursuant to their authority: And have expressly provided by those articles, that alterations therein which shall be agreed to by Congress, and confirmed by the legislatures, shall become part thereof: The legislature nevertheless of this State, would probably have applied to the people for their sense on such alterations, before a confirmation thereof, but no one will pretend to say that the federal Convention have reported alterations, or if they had, that Congress have agreed to, or the legislature confirmed them. The federal Convention, have, as has been shewn, reported a system, which destroys the articles of Confederation, and completely embraces the consolidation of the union: They have also recommended, that this new system should be administered, when ratified by nine States, and it must clearly appear, that the ratification of it by the Convention of this State, would not only be a violation of the State Constitution, but also of the articles of Confederation—[700] would thus be a double act of political perfidy—and would not be binding on any State, not even on those which may thus ratify it. Such a measure, therefore would not only tear up by the roots, and annihilate all confidence in the most sacred and solemn covenants between the whole people and each citizen of this State, but also between the whole of the States and each State, and the new Constitution would not stand on the ground of right, good faith, or publick confidence. Notwithstanding then the good intentions of the federal Convention, it is an unfortunate circumstance that they did not strictly adhere to their powers, because the mode proposed for ratification, as well as the system itself, must produce great convulsions. Sir William Temple, in treating “of popular discontents,” says, “The first safety of Princes and States lies in avoiding all councils or designs of innovation in ancient and established forms, and laws, especially those concerning liberty, property and religion (which are the possessions men will ever have most at heart) and thereby leaving the channel of honour and common justice clear and undisturbed.”6 The new system was not only unauthorized, but altogether unexpected by Congress, the legislature, and the people, is not merely an innovation, but an interchange of the “established form” of government; and will produce as great a charge in the laws concerning liberty and property—does not only disturb, and in some instances alter but in others destroys the channels of honour and common justice—and so far is the mode of adoption from being constitutional, as that it violates the Constitutions of the States and of the union, and establishes a precedent, not only for annihilating the new Constitution itself, but for building on its ruins a compleat system of despotism—for what will the people have to secure them against an introduction of the most arbitrary government, after the banishment of good faith from the United States of America? Is it not incumbent then on the State Convention, to consider seriously and thoroughly, in what a situation they will place this Commonwealth and the union, by the proposed ratification? This State, before it shall have declared in favour of the new system as it stands, may have great influence in promoting an accommodation of this matter, between contending States, and the contending citizens of each State, and having the confidence of all parties, may as a wise mediatrix, promote their common interest: But whet the State shall have manifested such a total disregard to the obligations of the most solemn political compacts, as to ratify in the mode proposed, the new Constitution, then will end the confidence of the union, and of our own citizens in the decision of Massachusetts, and she will embark in a precarious bottom, with the gloomy prospect of an approaching tempest, and unnecessarily expose herself to a political shipwreck.—If then, the new Constitution, ratified in its present form [701]and in the mode proposed, will not stand on the ground of right, good faith, or publick confidence, on what ground will it stand? Mr. Lock, in his treatise mentioned, chap. 17, sect. 197, says, “as conquest may be called a foreign usurpation, so usurpation is a kind of domestick conquest, with this difference, that an usurper can never have a right on his side, it being no usurpation but when one has got into the possession of what another has a right to.” The right of originating a system for consolidating the union, belonged only to the people, but the federal Convention have taken possession of it, when called for a different purpose, and can any one say their proceedings are not founded in usurpation? The same author goes on, “this, so far as it is usurpation, is a change only of persons, but not of the forms and rules of the government. For if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belonged to the lawful prince, or governour of the Commonwealth, it is tyranny added to usurpation.”7 Had the federal Convention then only exercised the powers of the people in originating a system of consolidation, it would have been nothing more than usurpation; but having changed the forms and rules of delegating powers to the federal government, the Convention have done what the governours or rulers of the Commonwealth had no right to do, and by promoting State Conventions to violate the most solemn compacts, have also done what the people themselves had no right to do, and as the principles and reasonings of the above celebrated writer apply more forcibly to the alteration or formation, than to the administration of government, are not the proceedings of the Convention, founded not only in usurpation, but also in tyranny? To what purpose then is it, to raise this mighty superstructure, which having no foundation, must soon fall and involve those in it in inevitable ruin—the federal Convention were undoubtedly urged to these measures by conceiving, that their system, if well adapted to the welfare of the people, would nevertheless meet with opposition from some of the States, and be thus defeated: But did not an honest zeal lead the Convention, as it has often lead others if to a remedy worse than the disease? Should not a proper system have been sent in a constitutional mode to the States, with a presumption that every State would do what was for the good of the whole; and if any of them had withheld their assent from a measure requisite for the general welfare, and thus rendered a separation necessary; should it not have been preceeded by a declaration, stating the reasons and necessity of such a separation? Surely such a dismemberment will require as much solemnity as that which separated us from Great-Britain, and may produce as important consequences. Many great objections to the new system have been unanswered, and I conceive, if we mean to support our liberties, are unanswerable: Notwithstanding which the State Convention will in all probability be warmly urged to accept the system, and at the same time to propose amendments—this indeed may take in the weak and unwary, but not persons of discernment: For a wise people will never place over themselves an arbitrary government, in expectation that it will be so remarkably virtuous as to divest itself of unreasonable and unlimitted powers. Is not this contrary to human nature, which is generally grasping at more power, not knowing often times that it would be abused as soon as obtained? The new Constitution provides “that the Congress whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress:”—To call a Convention then, two thirds of both houses of the new Congress must deem it necessary, or the legislatures of two thirds of the several States must make an application to Congress; and can it be doubted that there will not be found such a majority of the new Congress, or of the State legislatures disposed to call a Convention for making amendments? When the Constitution is adopted, will not the friends of it strenuously contend to give it a trial? Are there not numbers who at this time openly reprobate republican governments? And will not such persons raise numberless objections to the appointment of such a Convention, and endeavour to prevent it? But supposing a Convention should be called, what are we to expect from it, after having ratified the proceedings of the late federal Convention? They will be called to make “amendments” an indefinite term, that may be made to signify any thing. Should Judge M’Kean, be of the new Convention, perhaps he will think a system of despotism,8 an amendment to the present plan, and should the next change be only to a monarchial government, the people may think themselves very happy, for bad as the new system is, it is the best they will ever have should they now adopt it. If therefore, it is the intention of the Convention of this State to preserve republican principles in the federal government, they must accomplish it before, for they never can expect to effect it after a ratification of the new system."
Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,1/14/1788,"To the CONVENTION of MASSACHUSETTS. The all important question is before you, and it is for you to say whether you as a people will be happy or miserable—’tis yours to determine whether your blood-bought Independence should prove a blessing [710]or a curse of the first magnitude to you and your posterity; ’tis yours to determine whether Liberty and Property, the objects which you once had in the highest veneration are worth retaining; ’tis for you to inform the world, whether there is any thing contained in those pompous words which is in any degree preferable to what you once despised, and had the most sovereign and perpendicular contempt for—Slavery. The time is arisen when you must decide on this important affair, and is it possible that the illustrious, the so justly renowned citizens of Massachusetts of whom you are an epitome, should by one precipitate, inconsiderate act disgrace all their former glorious, and I will add unparaleled exertions in the cause of Freedom? Will they after their numberless declarations to the world, of their attachment to, and adoration for her be the first, who shall unsheath the sword against her, and either assassinate her or drive her last asylum amongst mortals? Never had “the good people of this Commonwealth” a matter before the a which had involved in it questions of so high a nature as at present The federal system which is proposed to them for their approbation is pregnant with consequences of the first magnitude, consequences of the most serious nature; consequences which it appears to me are inseperably connected with inevitable ruin, and certain destruction for if you adopt the proposed system, you give your explicit approbation to the breaking in upon the continental constitution, and overthrowing the same in a way totally unconstitutional.—You will subvert the most essential principles of our State constitution, in a way wholly different from that provided in the constitution, and diametrically opposed to every principle of the said compact; you will make a sacrifice of every idea of public faith: You will set an unequivocal example of revolt from established constitutions; you will as far as your influence extends, sanctify a revolt and overturning of governments; you will teach the citizens of the United States, such principles as perhaps you would be very sorry at a future period, to see reduced to practice; you will practically tell them there is nothing which is serious in a national compact, and that it is wholly right at any time to rend to pieces the most sacred national stipulations, in a way entirely unknown to the constitution: All this, and more you will do if you approbate the proposed constitution in the way and manner proposed. But supposing for a moment for argument sake, that all these difficulties were removed, and that you had nothing to attend to but the direct consequences of the letter of this proposed constitution; should we find those consequences of a more salutary nature, or our situation any more eligible? If you adopt the proposed plan, you will subject yourselves to a government, where you will be totally unprotected by a BILL [711]OF RIGHTS, (without which no system of government ought, to be instituted) for ’tis expressly provided in [the] sixth article, that the laws made by the Federal Legislature, shall be paramount to the constitutions of the respective States.—You will not have the least shadow of security for the freedom of the Press.—Your right to a trial by a Jury in civil causes, will be annihilated—and in criminal prosecutions, you shall not have a right to insist upon a trial in the vicinity, which our State Constitution, that admiration of the world, declares to be the greatest security of the subject.2—You will not have the shadow of a security, but that your Federal Representatives by the direction of Congress, must be chosen in such a place, at such a time, and in such a manner, as will prevent ninety hundredths of the people from having any voice in the election.—You will be liable to be continually and perpetually saddled with a standing army, composed not only of the refuse of your own country, but of the sweepings of Newgate, and the off-scouring of the territories of all the mercenary Nabobs of Europe; who if they commit the most attrocious outrages, the grosest violations of all laws, the vilest acts of rapine, robbery, ravishment and murder, will well know who has the sole right of pardon, while you may have this consolation, that ’tis out of your hard earnings, they are to receive the reward of their services. New officers may be created, the duties of which you would shudder to hear named.—Your houses may cease to be your castles—the most unreasonable searches may be made on you, your papers, &c. &c. and you continually involved in foreign wars, to gratify a passion too apt to be predominant in rulers, who effect what is with no small degree of emphasis, called DIGNITY.—Your young men, the strength and pride of your country, liable—constantly liable to be drag[g]ed in consequence of treaties (which are to be paramount to your constitution and bill of rights) into the service of any foreign power, which stands in need of them.—Your Federal Senate the most important branch of the legislature (chosen on I had almost said the most unequal principles) to be in place for six years, in which time it is far from being impossible, but they may make themselves perpetual, and by their importance with regard to the Representatives, and their participation in the executive, may make themselves, in effect absolute.—Your State powers of laying imposts, &c. annihilated, so that you will be confined nearly to a dry tax, on polls and estates to discharge your State debt of 3,979,341 dollars—add to this as the sovereignty of your State will cease to exist, the Commonwealth will be as liable to have actions commenced against it as any other corporation (for aught I see) and there is provision made in the constitution for the constituting a Federal Supreme Judicial [712]Court, which shall have original Jurisdiction in cases where a State is a parts from which execution may issue on a Judgment on every note, with which this Commonwealth is chargeable (if the possessor will only be at the trouble of indorsing it to some inhabitant of any other State, or to a foreigner) and who will pretend to say, but such execution may be levyed on any estate, real or personal in this Commonwealth (if there is not money in the treasury to discharge it) and which shall be sold at public auction, to discharge the same, together with the enormous bill of cost, which may have arisen on the action? Congress will then have it in their power to suspend the dearest of all privileges, the writ of Habeas Corpus, and it will be in the power of the President, or President and Senate, as Congress shall think proper to empower, to take up and confine for any cause, or for any suspicion, or for no cause, perhaps any person, he or they shall think proper, and confine him where he or they shall sit as long as the said suspension continues (which may be unlimitted) and the poor man perhaps never have an opportunity for trial, and after (perhaps) years of imprisonment have no kind of possibility to obtain any kind of satisfaction for the loss of his liberty, &c. and his life may be involved in the matter, for should it be thought most expedient to have him assassinated by some remorseless ruffian, it may be no difficult thing to procure one to do it, when he is informed who possesses the power of pardoning. Will there be any security which any citizen of this Commonwealth will have, that his house shall not be made a barrack of, to entertain a standing army in time of peace? And I have sought in vain for an article in the proposed constitution, which makes provision that a person shall have any satisfaction for his property which is taken from him without his consent, and converted to the use of government. The Federal House of Representatives are to be sole judges of the qualifications of your Representatives in that House; and it does not appear but that they are to define what qualifications are necessary: so where you have chosen Representatives, you are by no means certain they will possess such qualifications as they may judge needful.—They are likewise to expel members for disorderly conduct, and there is no security but that holding up to public view, different sentiments from those of the majority may be construed into disorderly conduct, and the member expelled for offering his sentiments to the House, in a way which they may deem disorderly, all which may in effect take away the freedom of deliberation in the House. The foregoing are but a part of the disagreeable consequences, which you may experience from constituting such a continental legislature, vested with powers which you supposed would be infinitely unsafe to intrust your state legislature [713]with; a continental legislature which perhaps are removed the farthest from accountability, or responsibility to their constituents that any legislature ever was, which disgraced the name of Republicanism. In the course of all the vindications of the proposed constitution has one of the foregoing propositions ever been denied? I do not recollect one. What has been the arguments of the various characters who have attempted to defend the constitution? I am sorry to say it has been generally supported either by down right Billinsgate banter, or by fallacious arguments which have not the most remote connexion with conclusiveness. One of the most powerful arguments which has been made use of in its defence is the respectability of the characters who formed it. I wish by no means to detract an ace from their characters, I allow them to be perhaps second to none in the world.—But what have we to do with characters in this case? It is not men but measures that we have to consult about: If the greatest men in the world should lay it down as a fixed principle, that three and three were seven, would it be rational implicitly to acquiesce with the proposition? By no means. The consequence is easy. The greatest men are liable to be mistaken, and the convention as great as they were, it is generally supposed laboured under a mistake of a considerable magnitude, with regard to the powers contained in their commission, and the person who is mistaken once, may be again mistaken especially when he has got wandering on mistaken ground, and acts on mistaken principles. Notwithstanding no man has a greater veneration for the very respectable characters which composed the convention than I have, yet I will hazard this quere, Was there in that respectable body a man of a more illusterous character in any point of light than Julius Caesar? I do not think it will be suggested that there was, yet notwithstanding all his virtues how much better it would have been for Rome, if this great and good character had been numbered with those who never saw light—“Curse on his virtues, they’ve undone his country.”3 In short, it does not appear that great characters or small characters have any thing to do with this matter, the constitution should be brought to the great criterion, the FITNESS OF THINGS:—If it is found consistent therewith, for Heaven’s sake, let us adopt it; if it is found to be mene tekel,4 it would be worse than insanity to neglect refusing it. The proposing the present plan if it is rejected will not be without its advantages, for the investigation of the objections against it will furnish ample ideas how a constitution must be modified to comport not only with the bias, but also with the interest of the people whose welfare [714]is the sole end of government. When the inconveniencies of the proposed constitution are fully pointed out and understood, another convention may in a short time, fabricate a constitution which would secure every advantage of civil government, without any of the disadvantages which are contained in that which is so eagerly strove to be cram’d down us, and we may soon be the most happy people in the world; but if we inconsiderately adopt the present proposed system we shall find it nearly as hard to effect any reform therein, as it was to remove the ark from the mountain of Ararat, where it first lodged after the deluge; for the least attempt or proposal for that purpose, may be construed into treasonable practices, and attended with all the dreadful consequences that an indignant authority is capable of producing, when my fellow citizens though too late, will discover the dire effects of their ill-judged credulity, and will be sensible of the worth, and put a just estimate on the advice of a RANDOLPH, MASON, NELSON5 and GERRY, and other illustrious Patriots, whose virtue like that of Aristides the just, denied their assent to the measures incompatible with their country’s welfare.6 These, my fellow citizens, are men who may survive to receive the melancholy glory of their ruined country, which will then acknowledge that had their advice been adhered to, it would have saved it from the black gulph of infamy, horror & slavery into which it no less needlessly than precipitately, will plunge itself, if you are so infatuated as to adopt the proposed constitution. These things are at present in your power to adopt [or] to reject, they art; wholly at your election, and you must be answerable to yourselves, to your fellow citizens, to unborn posterity, and to your God (who made you free, and who earnestly desires you to retain your freedom) for the consequences which may flow from the choice you may make."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer (MA),,American Herald,,1/14/1788,"To the Town of BOSTON. I have no talent at writing, and therefore seldom attempt it—I think for my self, and always contend that I have an undeniable right to do it, and I consider the man who disguises his sentiments for fear, or favour, to be a disgrace to his specie. In the resolutions of your Mechanicks of the 7th January, 1788, they have given their opinion, that the proposed Constitution “is well calculated to secure the liberty, protect the property, and guard the rights of the citizens of America.”2 In other resolves, they say, it will encrease trade, gain them employ and subsistence, and that the rejecting of it will have a contrary effect.—If their first resolve is founded in truth, they had no need to have said more about it; for that contains full reason for its acceptance;—but if the first is wrong, the other considerations are as unmanly, and as much opposed to true patriotism, as their urging, that a man, merely because the Town of Boston has elected him, shall hold up his hand to establish a system, though his conscience may tell him that it is a dangerous tyranny. If such politicians are wanted, God knows that they are too plenty. But I doubt much whether they have carefully examined the Constitution.—The hypothesis, that General Washington and Dr. Franklin made it, is too strong an argument in the minds of [716]too many, to suffer them to examine, like Freemen, for themselves—They have not, perhaps, considered, that Congress having a right to levy all imposts and excises, and tax all persons, and all the property of the people, necessarily an[n]ihilates all the government over the states, and establishes one entire government over the whole;—that there never can be two several seperate sovereign powers, holding a controul over the same persons, and the same property at the same time: one must be in subordination to the other. Surely the power of the United States, will never be in subordinate to this Commonwealth, then who is to tax you? a House of Representatives, at three hundred miles distance from you, chosen for two years, and a Senate at the same place, chosen for six years; but it is said they are to lay no greater burdens on you, than they bear themselves;—but by setting their own wages, and establishing their own emoluments, they may ease themselves of what may oppress you; that the Supreme Judicial of Congress, will swallow up every other Court, or bring them under its power; because there can never be two seperate Supreme Judicials in the same government;—here then, we are to be a Consolidated Government, and yet the Judges have power to try civil causes, without a Jury.—Do the Tradesmen of Boston mean all this? They surely do not—then if they mean only to have Congress to possess the Controul of Commerce—and to raise a Revenue from it, they will answer all the purposes proposed in their Resolves, and by uniting to accept the Constitution with amendments, they may save their Country’s Liberty."
Letter,No,Nathaniel Barrell,George Thatcher,,,1/15/1788,"I can assure my friend Thatcher, his letter of 22d. ultimo was peculiarly flattering, and should have been answerd before, but for a variety [718]of reasons any of which I persuade myself you will be satisfied with, when you come to be informd of them, but which I have not time, now to mention—I am pleasd with the open freedom with which you touch political matters, and however we may differ on that point I hope we shall always view each other as friends to good Government—at present I confess to you we are not altogether agreed in sentiment respecting the federal frame which brings me to this town—the pamphlet you were pleasd to enclose on that subject2 I think is wrote in that easy familiar stile which is ever pleasing to me. but tho it has a tendency to elucidate if not remove some objections to the federal constitution, yet I dare not say ’tis a full answer to the many objections against it, however I think with you a great part of those objections are founded on remote possibilities—do realy what you so humourously define, spring from that doctrine I have heard you reprobate, as originating in the heart which we are told by him who made it, is as you say—but tho I give more credit to this declaration than you do, yet I would by no means treat congress, or such men as my friend Thatcher, as “tho they were rogues”—nay I have such an opinion of you Sir, that I would cheerfully consent to your being a leading man in the first congress, after we adopt the federal Government.—I hope you will not think me to familiar if I should say the manner in which you treat this subject is rather laugh fable than serious—and that it is much easier to tell the objectors to turn their representatives out, than to do it—I cant but think you know how dificult it is to turn out a representative who behaves ill, even tho chosen but for one year—think you not ‘twould be more dificult to remove one chosen for two years?—I could wish to lay my objections before you in the same familiar manner you have been pleasd to set me the example, but for want of your talents, I will do it in my own way, which are such as if not removd will prevent my acceeding to it—because after all the Willsonian orotary3—after all the learned arguments I have seen written—after all the labord speeches I have heard in its defence—and after the best investigation I have been able to give it—I see it pregnant with the fate of our libertys and if I should not live to feel its baneful effects, I see it intails wretchedness on my posterity—slavery on my children—for as it now stands congress will be vested with much more extensive powers than ever great Brittain exercisd over us—too great to intrust with any set of men, let their talents & vertues be ever so conspicuous—even tho composd of such exalted amiable characters as the great Washington—for while we consider them as men of like passion the same spontaneous inherent thirst for power with ourselvs—great & good as they may be when they enter upon this important charge, what dependance can we have on their [719]continuing so?—but were we sure they would continue the faithful guardians of our libertys, & prevent any infringments on the priviledges of the people—what assurance can we have that, such men will always hold the reins of Government?—that their successors will be such—history tells us Rome was happy under Augustus, tho wretched under Nero, who could have no greater power than Augustus—and that the same Nero when young in power could weep at signing a death warrant, tho afterwards became so callous to the tender feelings of humanity as to behold with pleasure Rome in flames.—but Sir I am convinced such that six years is too long a term for any set of men to be at the helm of Government for in that time they will get so firmly rooted their influence will be so great as to continue them for life—because Sir I am persuaded we are not able to support the additional charge of such a Government and that when our State Government, is annihilated this will not suit our local concerns so well as what we now have—because I think ’twill not be so much for our advantage to have our taxes imposed & levied at the pleasure of Congress as the method now pursued—and because Sir I think a Continental collector at the head of a standing army will not be so likely to do us justice in collecting the taxes, as the mode of collecting now practicd—and to crown all sir, because I think such a Government impracticable among men with such high notions of liberty as we americans. these are the general objections as they occur to my mind, the perticulars I cant bring within the bounds of a letter, all which convince me the federal constitution as it now stands, needs much amendment before ’twill be safe for us to adopt it—therefore as wise men—as the faithful guardians of the peoples libertys—and as we wish well to posterity it becomes to reject it unless such amendments take place as will secure to us & ours that liberty without which life is a burthen.—"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/15/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, The question then arises, what is the kind of government best adapted to the object of securing our persons and possessions from violence? I answer, a federal republick. By this kind of government each state reserves to itself the right of making and altering its laws for internal regulation, and the right of executing those laws without any external restraint, while the general concerns of the empire are committed to an assembly of delegates, each accountable to his own constituents. This is the happy form under which we live, and which seems to mark us out as a people chosen of God. No instance can be produced of any other kind of government so stable and energetick as the republican. The objection drawn from the Greek and Roman states does not apply to the question. Republicanism appears there in its most disadvantageous form. Arts and domestick employments were generally committed to slaves, while war was almost the only business worthy of a citizen. Hence arose their internal dissensions. Still they exhibited proofs of legislative wisdom and judicial integrity hardly to be found among their monarchick neighbours. On the other hand we find Carthage cultivating commerce, and extending her dominions for the long space of seven centuries, during which term the internal tranquillity was never disturbed by her citizens. Her national power was so respectable, that for a long time it was doubtful whether Carthage or Rome should rule. In the form of their government they bore a strong resemblance to each other. Rome might be reckoned a free state for about four hundred and fifty years. We have then the true line of distinction between those two nations, and a strong proof of the hardy materials which compose a republican government. If there was no other proofs, we might with impartial judges risk lie issue upon this alone. But our proof rests not here. The present state of Europe, and the vigour and tranquillity of our own governments, after experiencing this form for a century and an half, are decider proofs in favour of those governments which encourage commerce. A comparison of our own country, first with Europe and then with he other parts of the world, will prove, beyond a doubt, that the greatest share of freedom is enjoyed by the citizens, so much more does commerce flourish, The reason is, that every citizen has an influence [721]in making the laws, and thus they are conformed to the general interests of the state; but in every other kind of government they are frequently made in favour of a part of the community at the expense of the rest. The argument against republicks, as it is derived from the Greek and Roman states, is unfair. It goes on the idea that no other government is subject to be disturbed. As well might we conclude, that a limited monarchy is unstable, because, that under the feudal system, the nobles frequently made war upon their king, and disturbed the publick peace. We find, however, in practice, that limited monarchy is more friendly to commerce, because more friendly to the rights of the subject, than an absolute government; and that it is more liable to be disturbed than a republick, because less friendly to trade and the rights of individuals. There cannot, from the history of mankind, be produced an instance of rapid growth in extent, in numbers, in arts, and in trade, that will bear any comparison with our country. This is owing to what the friends of the new system, and the enemies of the revolution, for I take them to be nearly the same, would term our extreme liberty. Already, have our ships visited every part of the world, and brought us their commodities in greater perfection, and at a more moderate price, than we ever before experienced. The ships of other nations croud to our ports, seeking an intercourse with us. All the estimates of every party make the balance of trade for the present year to be largely in our favour. Already have some very useful, and some elegant manufactures got established among us, so that our country every day is becoming independent in her resources. Two thirds of the continental debt has been paid since the war, and we are in alliance with some of the most respectable powers of Europe. The western lands, won from Britain by the sword, are an ample fund for the principal of all our publick debts; and every new sale excites that manly pride, which is essential to national virtue. All this happiness arises from the freedom of our institutions and the limitted nature of our government; a government that is respected from principles of affection, and obeyed with alacrity. The sovereigns of the old world are frequently, though surrounded with armies, treated with insult; and the despotick monarchies of the east, are the most fluctuating, oppressive and uncertain governments of any form hitherto invented. These considerations are sufficient to establish the excellence of our own form, and the goodness of our prospects. Let us now consider the probable effects of a consolidation of the separate states into one mass; for the new system extends so far. Many ingenious explanations have been given of it; but there is this defect, [722]that they are drawn from maxims of the common law, while the system itself cannot be bound by any such maxims. A legislative assembly has an inherent right to alter the common law, and to abolish any of its principles, which are not particularly guarded in the constitution. Any system therefore which appoints a legislature, without any reservation of the rights of individuals, surrender all power in every branch of legislation to the government. The universal practice of every government proves the justness of this remark; for in every doubtful case it is an established rule to decide in favour of authority. The new system is, therefore, in one respect at least, essentially inferiour to our state constitutions. There is no bill of rights, and consequently a continental law may controul any of those principles, which we consider at present as sacred; while not one of those points, in which it is said that the separate governments misapply their power, is guarded. Tender acts and the coinage of money stand on the same footing of a consolidation of power. It is a mere fallacy, invented by the deceptive powers of mr. Wilson, that what rights are not given are reserved.2 The contrary has already been shewn. But to put this matter of legislation out of all doubt, let us compare together some parts of the book; for being an independent system this is the only way to ascertain its meaning. In article III. section 2, it is declared, that “the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority.” Among the cases arising under this new constitution are reckoned, “all controversies between citizens of different states,” which include all kinds of civil causes between those parties. The giving Congress a power to appoint courts for such a purpose is as much, there being no stipulation to the contrary, giving them power to legislate for such causes, as giving them a right to raise an army, is giving them a right to direct the operations of the army when raised. But it is not left to implication. The last clause of article I. section 8. expressly gives them power “to make all laws which shall be needful and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.” It is, therefore, as plain as words can make it, that they have a right by this proposed form to legislate for all kinds of causes respecting property between citizens of different states. That this power extends to all cases between citizens of the same state, is evident, from the sixth article, which declares all continental laws and treaties to be the supreme law of the land, and hat all state judges are bound thereby, “any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” If this is not binding [723]the judges of the separate states in their own office, by continental rules, it is perfect nonsense. There is then a complete consolidation of the legislative powers in all cases respecting property. This power extends to all cases between a state and citizens of another state. Hence a citizen, possessed of the notes of another state, may bring his action, and there is no limitation that the execution shall be levied on the publick property of the state, but the property of individuals is liable. This is a foundation for endless confusion and discord. This, right to try causes between a state and citizens of another state, involves in it all criminal causes; and a man who has accidentally transgressed the laws of another state, must be transported, with all his witnesses, to a third state, to be tried. He must be ruined to prove his innocence. These are necessary parts of the new system, and it will never be complete till they are reduced to practice. They effectually prove a consolidation of the states, and we have before shewn the ruinous tendency of such a measure. By sect. 8, of article 1. Congress are to have the unlimitted right to regulate commerce, external and internal, and may therefore create monopolies which have been universally injurious to all the subjects of the countries that have adopted them, excepting the monopolists themselves. They have also the unlimited right to imposts and all kinds of taxes, as well to levy as to collect them. They have indeed very nearly the same powers claimed formerly by the British parliament. Can we have so soon forgot our glorious struggle with that power, as to think a moment of surrendering it now? It makes no difference in principle whether the national assembly was elected for seven years or for six. In both cases we should vote to great disadvantage, and therefore ought never to agree to such an article. Let us make provision for the payment of the interest of our part of the debt, and we shall be fairly acquitted. Let the fund be an impost on our foreign trade, and we shall encourage our manufactures. But if we surrender the unlimitted right to regulate trade and levy taxes, imposts will oppress our foreign trade for the benefit of other states, while excises and taxes will discourage our internal industry. The right to regulate trade, without any limitations, will, as certainly as it is granted, transfer the trade of this state to Pennsylvania. That will be the seat of business and of wealth, while the extremes of the empire will, like Ireland and Scotland, be drained to fatten an overgrown capital. Under our present equal advantages, the citizens of this state come in for their full share of commercial profits. Surrender the rights of taxation and commercial regulation, and the landed states at the southward will all be interested in draining our resources; for whatever can be got by impost on our trade and excises [724]or our manufactures, will be considered as so much saved to a state inhabited by planters. All savings of this sort ought surely to be made in favour of our own state; and we ought never to surrender the unlimitted powers of revenue and trade to uncommercial people. If we do, the glory of the state from that moment departs, never to return. The safety of our constitutional rights consists in having the business of government lodged in different departments, and in having each part well defined. By this means each branch is kept within the constitutional limits. Never was a fairer line of distinction than what may be easily drawn between the continental and state governments. The latter provide for all cases, whether civil or criminal, that can happen ashore, because all such causes must arise within the limits of some state. Transactions between citizens may all be fairly included in this idea, even although they should arise in passing by water from one state to another. But the intercourse between us and foreign nations, properly forms the department of Congress. They should have the power of regulating trade under such limitations as should render their laws equal. They should have the right of war and peace, saving the eq[u]ality of rights, and the territory of each state. But the power of naturalization and internal regulation should not be given them. To give my scheme a more systematick appearance, I have thrown it into the form of a resolve, which is submitted to your wisdom for amendment, but not as being perfect. “Resolved, that the form of government proposed by the federal convention, lately held in Philadelphia, be rejected on the part of this commonwealth; and that our delegates in Congress are hereby authorised to propose on the part of this commonwealth, and, if the other states for themselves agree thereto, to sign an article of confederation, as an addition to the present articles, in the form following, provided such agreement be made on or before the first day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord 1790; the said article shall have the same force and effect as if it had been inserted in the original confederation, and is to be construed consistently with the clause in the former articles which restrains the United States from exercising such powers as are not expressly given.3 [“]XIV.4 The United States shall have power to regulate, whether by treaty, ordinance, or law, the intercourse between these states and foreign dominions and countries, under the following restrictions. No treaty, ordinance, or law shall give a preference to the ports of one state over those of another; nor 2d. impair the territory or internal [725]authority of any state; nor 3d. create am monopolies or exclusive companies; nor 4th. naturalise any foreigners. All their imposts and prohibitions shall be confined to foreign produce and manufactures imported, and to foreign ships trading in our harbours. All imposts and confiscations shall be to the use of the state where they shall accrue, excepting only such branches of impost, as shall be assigned by the separate states to Congress for a fund to defray the interest of their debt, and their current charges. In order the more effectually to execute this and the former articles, Congress shall have authority to appoint courts, supreme & subordinate, with power to try all crimes, not relating to state securities, between any foreign state, or subject of such state, actually residing in a foreign country, and not being an absentee or person who has alienated himself from these states on the one part, and any of the United States or citizens thereof on the other part; also all causes in which foreign ambassadours or other foreign ministers resident here shall be immediately concerned, respecting the jurisdiction or immunities only. And the Congress shall have authority to execute the judgment of such courts by their own affairs. Piracies and felonies committed on the high seas shall also belong to the department of Congress for them to define, try, and punish, in the same manner as the other causes shall be defined, tried, and determined. All the before mentioned causes shall be tried by jury, and in some seaport town. And it is recommended to the general court at their next meeting to provide and put Congress in possession of funds arising from foreign imports and ships sufficient to defray our share of the present annual expenses of the continent.” Such a resolve explicitly limitting the powers granted is the farthest we can proceed with safety. The scheme of accepting the report of the Convention, and amending it afterwards, is merely delusive. There is no intention among those who make the proposition to amend it at all. Besides, if they have influence enough to get it accepted in its present form, there is no probability, that they will consent to an alteration when possessed of an unlimited revenue. It is an excellence in our present confederation, that it is extremely difficult to alter it. An unanimous vote of the states is required.5 But this newly proposed form is founded in injustice, as it proposes that a fictitious consent of only nine states shall be sufficient to establish it. Nobody can suppose that the consent of a state is any thing more than a fiction, in the view of the federalists, after the mobbish influence used over the Pennsylvania convention. The two great leaders of the plan, with a modesty of Scotsmen, placed a rabble in the gallery to applaud their speeches, and thus [726]supplied their want of capacity in the argument. Repeatedly were Wilson and M’Kean worsted in the argument by the plain good sense of Findly and Smilie.6 But reasoning or knowledge had little to do with the federal party. Votes were all they wanted by whatever means obtained. Means not less criminal have been mentioned among us. But votes that are bought can never justify a treasonable conspiracy. Better, far better, would it be to reject the whole, and remain in possession of present advantages. The authority of Congress to decide disputes between states is sufficient to prevent their recurring to hostility: and their different situation, wants and produce is a sufficient foundation for the most friendly intercourse. All the arts of delusion and legal chicanery will be used to elude your vigilance, and obtain a majority. But keeping the constitution of the state, and the publick interest in view, will be your safety. (We are obliged, contrary to our intention, to postpone the remainder of Agrippa till our next.)"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle,,1/15/1788,"It was objected by some gentlemen, in the course of the debates, on Tuesday last, that the lengthening of the time for setting in Congress was rendered more ineligible from the want of a provision for a rotation in office, and for recalling the Delegates. In case of misbehaviour it is much better to drop them by silent neglect, than to turn them out by impeachment. The necessary information of a Representative is to be obtained at home as well as at Congress. It is at home he is to verse [1209]himself in the interests and feelings of his particular constituents, and if a long time is necessary to give him an understanding of foreign affairs, the opportunity may be afforded him by re-elections, which have taken place, in almost every instance with respect to the present and late Delegates of Massachusetts. As to the saving of expense, the observation cannot apply to this State, as the elections are annual, and no additional trouble would be created from chusing Representatives to Congress, at the same time with those of the Commonwealth. This too was applicable to most, if not to all of the States, except South Carolina, in some of which the elections were even semi-annual"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/18/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, To tell us that we ought to look beyond local interests, and judge for the good of the empire, is sapping the foundation of a [742]free state. The first principle of a just government is, that it shall operate equally. The report of the convention is extremely unequal. It takes a larger share of power from some, and from others, a larger share of wealth. The Massachusetts will be obliged to pay near three times their present proportion towards continental charges. The proportion is now ascertained by the quantity of landed property, then it will be by the number of persons. After taking the whole of our standing revenue, by impost and excise, we must still be held to pay a sixth part of the remaining debt. It is evidently a contrivance to help the other states at our expense. Let us then be upon our guard, and do no more than the present confederation obliges. While we make that our beacon we are safe. It was framed by men of extensive knowledge and enlarged ability, at a time when some of the framers of the new plan were hiding in the forests to secure their precious persons.2 It was framed by men, who were always in favour of a limitted government, and whose endeavours Heaven has crowned with success. It was framed by men, whose idols were not power and high life, but industry and constitutional liberty, and who are now in opposition to this new scheme of oppression. Let us then cherish the old confederation like the apple of our eye. Let us confirm it by such limitted powers to Congress, and such an enlarged intercourse, founded on commerce and mutual want, with the other states, that our union shall outlast time itself. It is easier to prevent an evil than to cure it. We ought therefore to be cautious of innovations. The intrigues of interested politicians will be used to seduce even the elect. If the vote passes in favour of the plan, the constitutional liberty of our country is gone forever. If the plan should be rejected, we always have it in our power, by a fair vote of the people at large, to extend the authority of Congress. This ought to have been the mode pursued. But our antagonists were afraid to risk it. They knew that the plan would not bear examining. Hence we have seen them insulting all who were in opposition to it, and answering arguments only with abuse. They have threatened and they have insulted the body of the people. But I may venture to appeal to any man of unbiassed judgment, whether his feelings tell him, that there is any danger at all in rejecting the plan. I ask not the palsied or the jaundiced, nor men troubled with bilious or nervous affections, for they can see danger in every thing. But I apply to men who have no personal expectations from a change, and to men in full health. The answer of all such men will be, that never was a better time for deliberation. Let us then, while we have it in our power, secure the happiness and freedom of the present and future ages. To accept of the report [743]of the convention, under the idea that we can alter it when we please, will be sporting with fire-brands arrows and death. It is a system which must have an army to support it, and there can be no redress but by a civil war. If, as the federalists say, there is a necessity of our receiving it, for heaven’s sake let our liberties go without, our making a formal surrender. Let us at least have the satisfaction of protesting against it, that our own hearts may not reproach us for the meanness of deserting our dearest interests. Our present system is attended with the inestimable advantage of preventing unnecessary wars. Foreign influence is assuredly smaller in our publick councils, in proportion as the members are subject to be recalled. At present, their right to sit continues no longer than their endeavours to secure the publick interest. It is therefore not an object for any foreign power to give a large price for the friendship of a delegate in Congress. If we adopt the new system, every member will depend upon thirty thousand people, mostly scattered over a large extent of country, for his election. Their distance from the seat of government will make it extremely difficult for the electors to get information of his conduct. If he is faithful to his constituents, his conduct will be misrepresented, in order to defeat his influence at home. Of this we have a recent instance, in the treatment of the dissenting members of the late federal convention.3 Their fidelity to their constituents was their whole fault. We may reasonably expect similar conduct to be adopted, when we shall have rendered the friendship of the members valuable to foreign powers, by giving them a secure seat in Congress. We shall too have all the intrigues, cabals and bribery practised, which are usual at elections in Great-Britain. We shall see and lament the want of publick virtue; and we shall see ourselves bought at a publick market, in order to be sold again to the highest bidder. We must be involved in all the quarrels of European powers, and oppressed with expense, merely for the sake of being like the nations round about us. Let us then, with the spirit of freemen, reject the offered system, and treat as it deserves the proposition of men who have departed from their commission; and let us deliver to the rising generation the liberty purchased with our blood."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/19/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow citizen, The proceedings of the federal Convention, having, as has been shewn, originated in usurpation, and being founded in tyranny, cannot be ratified by the State Convention, without breaking down the barriers of liberty; trampling on the authority of federal and State Constitutions, and annihilating in America, governments founded in compact. In this predicament, there appears but two measures which can with safety be adopted by the Convention of this State. One has been hinted at, an adjournment, until the sense of Virginia can be [748]known. The great danger in this business is, from precipitation, not from delay: The latter cannot injure whilst the former may irretrievably ruin us; an adjournment would not only ripen the judgment of our own citizens, but give them an opportunity of benefiting by the opinions of those States, which are attentive to, but not extravagantly zealous in this matter. The other measure is, to return the proceedings of the federal Convention to the legislature of this State, to be by them transmitted to Congress, and amended agreeably to the articles of Confederation: For the system being improperly before the State Convention, and they being incompetent to a ratification of it, cannot thereby bind the citizens of Massachusetts. Had the system been in itself unobjectionable, it is evident from what has been said, that the sentiments of the qualified voters on the necessity of a revision, must have been taken, and two thirds of them must have been in favour of it, before a State Convention could be called for amending the Constitution, much more for dissolving the government. Let us once more particularly attend to the system itself. It begins, “We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,” &c. “do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America”—In other words, We the people, do hereby publickly declare the violation of the faith which we have solemnly pledged to each other—do give the most unequivocal evidence, that we cannot ourselves, neither can any others, place the least confidence in our most solemn covenants, do effectually put an end in America, to governments founded in compact—do relinquish that security for life, liberty and property, which we had in the Constitutions of these States, and of the Union—do give up governments which we well understood, for a new system which we have no idea of—and we do, by this act of ratification and political suicide, destroy the new system itself, and prepare the way for a despotism, if agreeable to our rulers. All this we do, for the honour of having a system of consolidation formed by us the people. This is not magnifying, for such are the facts, and such will be the consequences. Indeed we find despotism not only in contemplation of the Pennsylvanians, but openly avowed in their State Convention, in the words following—“Despotism, if wisely administered, is the best system invented by the ingenuity of man.” This was declared by chief justice M’Kean2 and in such an high office, we must suppose him a man of too much precaution to have made the declaration, had he not known, that a majority of the Convention, and of the citizens, who so highly applauded his speeches, were of his opinion. M. Montesquieu, in his “Spirit of Laws,” 1st vol. book 3, chap. 9, says, “As virtue is necessary in a republick, and honour in a monarchy, so fear is necessary in a despotick government: With regard to virtue there is no occasion for it, and honour would be extremely [749]dangerous,”3 Thus has a declaration been made in Pennsylvania, in favour of a government which substitutes fear for virtue, and reduces men from rational beings to the level of brutes; and if the citizens of Massachusetts are disposed to follow the example, and submit their necks to the yoke, they must expect to be governed by the whip and goad But it is remarkable, that the resolution of the federal Convention, for transmitting the system to the people, provided, “that the Constitution should be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, and afterwards submitted to a Convention of Delegates, chosen in each State by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature[”]4 thus making Congress and the legislatures, vehicles of conveyance, but precluding them from passing their judgments on the system. Had it been submitted to their consideration, their members were men of such discernment, that the defects as well as excellencies of the plan, would have been clearly explained to the people; but immediately on the publication of it, we find measures were taken to prejudice the people against all persons in the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the States and Confederacy (if opposed to the plan) as being actuated by motives of private interest. Mr. Wilson, a member of the federal and Pennsylvanian Convention, in his town meeting speech, adopted this practice, which, to say the least of it, was very illiberal.5 Indeed, it is but justice to observe, that many artful advocates of this plan, to cover their designs of creating a government which will afford abundance of legislative offices for placemen and pensioners, proclaimed suspicions of others, and diverted the attention of the people from themselves, on whom the odium should fall. Let us now proceed to the provision in the system for a representation of the people, which is the corner stone of a free government. The Constitution provides, art. 1st, sect. 2, “that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States, which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons.” [“]Representatives” then are to be “apportioned among the several States, according to their respective numbers,” and five slaves, in computing those numbers, are to be classed with three freemen—By which rule, fifty thousand slaves, having neither liberty or property, will have a representative in that branch of the legislature—to which more especially will be committed, the protection of the liberties, and disposal of all the property of the freemen of the Union—for thus stands the new Constitution. Should it be said, that not the slaves but their masters are to send [750]a representative, the answer is plain—If the slaves have a right to be represented, they are on a footing with freemen, three of whom can then have no more than an equal right of representation with three slaves, and these when qualified by property, may elect or be elected representatives, which is not the case: But if they have not a right to be represented, their masters can have no right derived from their slaves, for these cannot transfer to others what they have not themselves. Mr. Locke, in treating of political or civil societies, chap. 7, sect. 85, says, that men “being in the state of slavery, not capable of any property, cannot, in that state, be considered as any part of civil society, the chief end whereof, is the preservation of property.”6 If slaves, then, are no part of civil society, there can be no more reason in admitting them, than there would be in admitting the beasts of the field, or trees of the forest, to be classed with free electors. What covenant are the freemen of Massachusetts about to ratify? A covenant that will degrade them to the level of slaves, and give to the States who have as many blacks as whites, eight representatives, for the same number of freemen as will enable this State to elect five—Is this an equal, a safe, or a righteous plan of government? Indeed it is not. But if to encrease these objections, it should be urged, “that representation being regulated by the same rule as taxation, and taxation being regulated by a rule intended to ascertain the relative property of the States, representation will then be regulated by the principle of property.” This answer would be the only one that could be made, for representation, according to the new Constitution is to be regulated, either by numbers or property. Let us now inquire of those who take this ground, what right they have to put a construction on the constitution, which is repugnant to the express terms of the Constitution itself? This provides, “that representatives shall be apportioned among the several States, according to their respective numbers.” Not a word of property is mentioned, but the word “numbers” is repeatedly expressed—Admitting however that property was intended by the Constitution as the rule of representation, does this mend the matter? It will be but a short time, after the adoption of the new Constitution, before the State legislatures, and establishments in general will be so burthensome and useless as to make the people desirous of being rid of them, for they will not be able to support them. The State appointment of Representatives will then cease, but the principle of representation according to property, will undoubtedly be retained, and before it is established it is necessary to consider whether it is a just one, for of once it is adopted it will not be easily altered.—According to this principle, a man worth £.50,000 is to have as many votes for representatives in the new Congress, as one thousand men, worth £.50 each: And [751]sixty such nabobs may send two representatives, while sixty thousand freemen having £.50 each can only send the same number. Does not this establish in the representative branch of the new Congress, a principle of aristocracy, with a vengeance? The Constitution of the several States, admit of no such principle, neither can any freeman with safety thus surrender, not only the intire disposition of their property, but also, the controul of their liberties and lives to a few opulent citizens. Should it be said that the rule of federal taxation, being advantageous to the State, it should be content with the same rule for representation. The answer is plain, the rule gives no advantage, but is supposed to be advantageous to Massachusetts, and to be an accommodation very beneficial to the southern States: But admiting this State will be benefited by the rule, is it disposed to sell its birthright, the right of an equal representation in the federal councils for so small a consideration? Would this State give up that right to any State that would pay our whole proportion of direct and indirect taxes? Shall we relinquish some of the most essential rights of government, which are our only security for every thing dear to us, to avoid our proportion of the publick expense? shall we give up all we have, for a small part of it? This if agreed to, would be no great evidence of our wisdom or foresight. But it is not probable, in the opinion of some of the ablest advocates for the new system, that direct taxes will ever be levied on the States, and if not, the provision for levying such taxes will be nugatory: We shall receive no kind of benefit from it, and shall have committed ourselves to the mercy of the states having slaves, without any consideration whatever. Indeed, should direct taxes be necessary, shall we not by increasing the representation of those States, put it in their power to prevent the levying such taxes, and thus defeat our own purposes? Certainly we shall, and having given up a substantial and essential right, shall in lieu of it, have a mere visionary advantage. Upon the whole then, it must be evident, that we might as well have committed ourselves to the parliament of Great-Britain, under the idea of a virtual representation as in this manner resign ourselves to the federal government."
Letter,No,Elbridge Gerry, William Cushing,,,1/21/1788,"Sir It is with great reluctance that I trespass a moment on the time of the honorable Convention, employed as it is, on a subject of the highest importance to this country, but I am under the necessity of stating some facts, & their consequences, as they relate to myself— On the 14th of this month, the Convention passed a vote requesting me “to take a seat in the house, to answer any question of fact from time to time, that the Convention may want to ask, respecting the passing of the constitution.” this request was unexpected, & I complied with it, contrary to my inclination, not doubting in the least that I should be treated with delicacy & candor. Every Gentleman who will reflect but a moment, must be sensible, that my situation on the floor of the convention, was not elegible: that it was a humiliating condition, to which nothing could have produced my submission, but the respect I entertained for the honorable Convention, & the desire I had of complying with their wishes— after having on Saturday morning [19 January] stated an answer to the question proposed the preceeding evening, I perceived that your honorable body were considering a paragraph which respected an equal representation of the States in the Senate, & one of my honorable Colleagues2 observed, that this was agreed to by a Committee consisting of a member from each state, & that I was one of the number, this was a partial narrative of facts, which I conceived placed my conduct in an unfavorable point of light, probably, without any such intention on the part of my colleague. I was thus reduced to the disagreable alternative of addressing a letter to your honor for correcting this error, or of sustaining the injuries resulting from its unfavorable impressions: not in the least suspecting, that when I had committed myself to the convention without the right [1266]of speaking in my own defence, any Gentleman would take an undue advantage from being a member of the House, to continue the misrepresentation by suppressing every attempt on my part to state the facts. I accordingly informed your honor, that I was preparing a letter to throw light on the subject, & at my request you was so obliging as to make this communication to the house, my sole object was, to state the matter as it respected my conduct, but I soon perceived, that it was misunderstood by the honorable Judge Dana, who rose with an appearance of party virulence which I did not expect, & followed one misrepresentation with another, by impressing the House with the Idea, that I was entering into their debates. I requested leave repeatedly to explain the matter, but he became more vehement, & I was subject to strictures from several parts of the House, till it adjourned without even being permitted to declare, that I disdained3 such an intention, & did not merit such unworthy treatment. <I confess to you sir, that the indelicacy & disingenuity of this procedure distressed my feelings beyond anything I had ever before experienced:>4 for, had every member of the honorable House, requested me by a vote to partake in their debates, I should have considered it as improper, & unconstitutional, & from principles of decency, & propriety, should have declined their request: and Judge Dana has been too long in public life with me, not to know, that it has never been my practice, to attain objects by improper means, indeed, sir, so remote were my wishes from entering into your debates, that after having passed a judgment on the constitution in the federal convention, I would not have taken a seat in the state convention, with the unanimous suffrages of the citizens of Massachusetts, because in a matter of such important consequence, it was my wish that the final decision should5 be made by themselves. this was a fact early known to my particular friends, & I do not mention it to suggest an impropriety in accepting a seat in both conventions, but merely to shew the injustice done me on this occasion. If Judge Dana was apprehensive that the facts which I should state, would eventually prejudice the cause he so ardently advocated, still I conceive, he could not be justified in precluding those facts, which were necessary to do me justice; for bad indeed must be that cause which will not bear the light of truth. Judge Dana took sanctuary under the rules of the House, but I never yet heard of a rule, that was intended to prevent an injured person from addressing a letter to the body who should redress his wrongs, or from giving information of such an intention: and I conceive sir, that neither the honorable convention, or any republican body on earth, [1267]who had requested an individual to attend them for the purpose of giving them information, would have had any objection to granting him leave to speak, much less to address to them a letter, merely for the purpose of setting a matter right, which in the progress of debates, had by an erroneous statement tended to his injury. It is true, sir, I differ in opinion from a number of respectable members of your honorable House, on the subject of the proposed constitution, but I flattered myself, that not a member could be found so deficient in liberality, as to bear animosity towards me on this account, the strong impressions which I felt, & which I still feel, that this system without amendment will destroy the liberties of America, inferred on me an indispensible obligation to give it my negative:6 & having done this, I feel the approbation of my own mind, which is infinitely preferable to universal Applauses without it. if, nevertheless, my conduct in this instance has given offence; if there is at this time so little freedom in America, as that a person in discharging a most important public trust, cannot conduct according to the obligations of honor, & dictates of his Conscience, it appears to me of little consequence, what form of Government we adopt, for we are not far removed from a state of slavery. I shall only add sir, that I have subjoined a state of facts, founded on documents relative to my consent that the lesser States should have an equal representation in the senate—that I still entertain the highest respect for the honorable Convention who I am sure will never countenance unfair proceedings of any member of the house,7 but that I cannot again place myself in a situation, where I must hear my conduct misrepresented without the privilege of requesting leave of your honorable body to establish facts & promote Justice— I have the honor to be sir with the highest respect for the honorable Convention & yourself, your most obedt. & very humble servt A State of Facts a State of Facts, referred to in the preceeding letter— The Business of the federal Convention having been opened by Governor Randolph of Virginia, & the outlines of a plan of Government having been proposed by him, they were referred to a Committee of the whole House, & after several weeks debate, the Committee reported general principles for forming a constitution, amongst which were the two following  7th “That the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national Legislature” (by which was intended the house of Representatives) [1268]“ought not to be according to the rule established in the articles of Confederation, but according to some equitable ratio of representation Vizt in proportion to the whole number of white & other free citizens & Inhabitants, of every age, sex, & condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of years & three fifths of all other persons not comprehended in the foregoing description, except indians not paying taxes in each state” 8thly “That the right of suffrage in the second branch of the national legislature, meaning the Senate, ought to be according to the rule established for the first”8 In the Committee of the whole, the eighth Article above recited, for which I voted, was carried, if my memory serves me by six States against five;9 & when under consideration of the convention, it produced a ferment, & a seperate meeting as I was informed of most of the delegates of those five States—the result of which was a firm determination on their part not to relinquish the right of an equal representation in the Senate, confirmed as it was to those States by the articles of confederation, the matter at length became so serious, as to threaten a dissolution of the Convention, & a Committee consisting of a member from each state was appointed, to meet (if possible) on the ground of accomodation.—the members from the three large states of Virginia, Pennsylvania & Massachusetts, were Mr Mason Doctor Franklin & myself, & after debating the subject several days, during which time the convention adjourned, the Committee agreed to the following report “That the subsequent propositions be recommended to the Convention, on condition that both shall be generally adopted. first [“]That in the first branch of the legislature, each of the States now in the union be allowed one member for every forty thousand Inhabitants, of the description reported in the seventh Resolution of the committee of the whole House—that each state not containing that number shall be allowed one member—that all Bills for raising or appropriating money, & for fixing the salaries of the officers of Government of the united States shall originate in the first branch of the legislature, & shall not be altered or amended by the second branch & that no money shall be drawn from the treasury of the united States, but in pursuance of appropriations to be originated by the first branch— secondly “That in the second branch of the Legislature, each state shall have an equal vote”10 The Number of 40,000 inhabitants to every member in the House of Representatives, was not a subject of much debate, or an object insisted on, as some of the committee were opposed to it—accordingly [1269]on the 10th of July a motion was made “to double the number of Representatives being sixty five” & it passed in the negative.11 The admission however of the smaller States to an equal representation in the Senate, never would have been agreed to by the Committee or by myself as a member of it without the provision “that all bills for raising or appropriating money & for fixing the salaries of the officers of Government” should originate in the house of Representatives & “not be altered or amended” by the Senate “& that no money should be drawn from the treasury” “but in pursuance of such appropriations”12 This provision was agreed to by the convention at the same time & by the same vote, as that which allows to each State an equal voice in the senate,13 & was afterwards referred to the Committee of detail & reported by them as a part of the Constitution, as will appear by documents in my possession.14 nevertheless the smaller States, having attained their object of an equal voice15 in the Senate, a new provision now in the Constitution was substituted, whereby the Senate have a right to propose amendments to money revenue bills; & the provision reported by the committee was effectually destroyed.16 It was conceived by the committee to be highly unreasonable & unjust, that a small State which would contribute but one sixty fifth part of any tax should nevertheless have an equal right with a large state, which would contribute eight or ten sixty fifths of the same tax, to take money from the pockets of the latter, more especially as it was intended, that the powers of the new legislature should extend to internal taxation—it was likewise conceived, that the right of expending should be in proportion to the ability of raising money—that the larger States would not have the least Security for their property, if they had not the due command of their own purses—that they would not have such command, if the lesser states in either branch had an equal right with the larger to originate or even to alter17 money bills—that if the Senate should have the power of proposing amendments, they may propose that a bill originated by the house to raise one thousand should be increased to one hundred thousand pounds—that altho the house may negative amendments proposed by the Senate, yet the giving them power to propose amendments would enable them to increase the Grants of the house, because the Senate (as well as the house) would have a right to adhere to their votes & would oblige the house to consent to such an increase on the principle of accomodation—that the lesser States would thus have nearly as much command of the property of the Greater as they themselves—that even if the representation in the senate had been according to numbers in each State, money bills [1270]should not be originated or altered by that branch, because by their appointments the members would be farther removed from the people, would have a greater & more independent property in their offices, would be more extravagant, & not being so easily removed, would be ever in favour of higher Salaries than members of the House.—that it was not reasonable to suppose the aristocratical branch would be as saving of the public money as the democratical branch—last but that on the other hand, should the senate have only the power of concurrence, or nonconcurrence of such bills they would pass them altho the Grants should not equal their wishes: whilst with the power of amendment they would never be satisfied with the Grant of the House—that the Commons of Great Britain had ever strenuously & successfully contended for this important right, which the Lords had often but in vain endeavoured to exercise—that the preservation of this right, <the right of holding the purse strings,>18 was essential to the preservation of Liberty—& that to this right perhaps was principally owing the liberty that still remains in great Britain— These are the facts & reasons whereon was grounded the admission of the smaller States to an equal representation in the Senate, & it must appear that there is an essential difference between an unqualified admission of them to an equal representation in the Senate, & admitting them <from necessity>, on the <express condition> provided in the recited report of the committee—it must also appear, that had that provision been preserved in the constitution & the senate precluded from a right to alter or amend money or revenue bills, agreably to the said report, the lesser States would not have that <undue> command of the property of the larger States which they are now to have by the constitution—& that I never consented to an equal representation of the States in the Senate as it now stands in the new plan of Government System19—"

Will your pride and arrogance bear correction from uncorrupted understanding? And will your affectation of knowledge, bend to reproof, resulting from plain sense, and rustic decency? Your favorite system of despotism does not happen to suit the freeborn minds of those, who have so lately fought and bled in opposition to the same principles by which it is formed, and the same arrogant ideas by which you attempt in a lordly and over-bearing manner, to support it. I am a plain countryman; I came into Boston under the confidence of my town who are Freemen;—I came to hear arguments, and to bend to conviction; I have spoken my sentiments—I have not been hissed, tho’ I had reason to expect it—I am pointed at and abused in the streets, for what? Because I feel the independence of a Freeman, and act according to my sentiments. All wisdom is now supposed to be concentered in one town, and we seem to be considered as mere cattle.—But when your ports were shut up; when your tradesmen were starving, and your trade at an end, our free Donations of beef and grain were very acceptable.—We were then called upon to sacrifice for Trial by Jury, for freedom of speech, and writing, in religion, and politicks. But when we come to exercise the freedom we have contended for, we are treated with contempt and ridiculed. We are aware, that there are many men of rank and eminence, who are in favour of the New Constitution:—And we are sorry to observe, that the same sentiments, the same contempt for the rusticity of low life, and the same scorn of our abilities, as men in office had before the revolution, still remains in our country.—But they who conceive, that a mere Paper System, can change the feelings, views and ideas of the great body of the people, at once, are no politicians. The progress from Freedom to Slavery, must be progressive; the transition proposed is too sudden.—The gulph is too deep for one leap; if Democracy is a volcano containing the fiery materials, of its [758]own dissolution,1 this System is a bottomless ocean, where the sinking into Slavery is endless—it is a deep mine, where iron shackles are produced by the natural heat of the vapour, in perfect shape, without the weight of the Hammer. Can you, ye wise men of Goshen, suppose or believe, that we shall submit to give up our County Courts, and go many days journey from home for that Justice we used to receive [at?] our own doors? Can one Judge appointed by Congress, try all the causes which will arise under this constitution, and which the chicane of Lawyers will throw into that jurisdiction? Where are we to have our land titles tried? Not in our own Counties, but in the Metropolis, where the Judge is to hold his pompous court. Do you think that we are to lay ourselves liable to be tried upon the information of an Attorney-General, exhibited in any part of the State, he shall choose to pack a Jury in, and that we are to be deprived of that grand Barrier, the Indictment by Grand Jury, merely because the gulled and ignorant Tradesmen of —— choose it, and will abase us unless we submit to it? Are we to give up every thing dear to us, because it is demanded by a set of men, who, while they make the demand, exhibit a spirit of despotism—equalled only by that of the Batons of the Germanic Empire (so extolled by Judge Elsworth) over their vassals.2 To be plain with you, we shall not.—We shall allow Congress the controul and regulation of trade, the revenue of all imposts and excises—with courts to carry their laws in execution, to try causes between State and State, public Ministers, &c. and the regulation of currency:—But we shall retain a trial by jury as our dearest privilege, as hat democratic balance, which can never be corrupted by Government, or subverted by the chicane of Lawyers.

GENTLEMEN, Truly deplorable, in point of argument, must be that cause, in whose defence persons of acknowledged learning and ability can say nothing pertinent. When they undertake to prove that the person elected is the safest person in the world to controul the exercise of the elective; powers of his constituents, we know what dependence is to he had upon their reasonings. Yet we have seen attempts to shew, that the fourth section of the proposed constitution, is an additional security to our rights. It may be such in the view of a Rhode-Island family (I think that state is quoted) who have been for some time in the minority: but it is extraordinary, that an enlightened character in the Massachusetts [Convention] should undertake to prove, that, from a single instance of abuse in one state, another state ought to resign its liberty.2 Can an[y] man, in the free exercise of his reason, suppose, that he is perfectly represented in the legislature, when that legislature may at pleasure alter the time, manner, and place of election.3 By altering the time they may continue a representative during his whole life; by altering the manner, they may fill up the vacancies by their own votes without the consent of the people; and by altering the place, all the elections may be made at the seat of the federal government. Of all the powers of government perhaps this is the most improper to be surrendered. Such an article at once destroys the whole check which the Constituents have upon their rulers. I should be less zealous upon this subject, if the power had not been often abused. The senate of Venice, the regencies of Holland, and the British parliament have all abused it. The last have not yet perpetuated themselves; but they have availed themselves repeatedly of popular commotions to continue in power. Even at this day we find attempts to vindicate the usurpation by which they continued themselves from three to seven years. All the attempts, and many have been made, to return to triennial elections, have proved abortive. These instances are abundantly sufficient to shew with what jealousy this right ought to be guarded. No sovereign on earth need be afraid to declare his crown elective, while the possessor [771]has the right to regulate the time, manner, and place of election. It is vain to tell us, that the proposed government guarantees to each state a republican form. Republicks are divided into democraticks, and aristocraticks. The establishment of an order of nobles, in whom should reside all the power of the state, would be an aristocratick republick. Such has been for five centuries the government of Venice, in which all the energies of government, as well as of individuals, have been cramped by a distressing jealousy that the rulers have of each other. There is nothing of that generous, manly confidence that we see in the democratick republicks of our own country. It is a government of force, attended with perpetual fear of that force. In Great-Britain, since the lengthening of parliaments, all our accounts agree, that their elections are a continued scene of bribery, riot and tumult; often a scene of murder. These are the consequences of choosing seldom, and for extensive districts. When the term is short, nobody will give an high price for a seat. It is an insufficient answer to these objections to say, that there is no power of government but may sometimes be applied to bad purposes. Such a power is of no value unless it is applied to a bad purpose. It ought always to remain with the people. The framers of our state constitution were so jealous of this right, that they fixed the days for election, meeting and dissolving of the legislature, and of the other officers of government. In the proposed constitution not one of these points is guarded, though more numerous and extensive powers are given them than to any state legislature upon the continent. For Congress is at present possessed of the direction of the national force, and most other national powers, and in addition to them are to be vested with all the powers of the individual states, unrestrained by any declarations of right. If these things are for the security of our constitutional liberty, I trust we shall soon see an attempt to prove that the government by an army will be more friendly to liberty than a system founded in consent, and that five states will make a majority of thirteen. The powers of controuling elections, of creating exclusive companies in trade, of internal legislation and taxations ought, upon no account, to be surrendered. I know it is a common complaint, that Congress want more power. But where is the limitted government that does not want it? Ambition is in a governour what money is to a miser—he can never accumulate enough. But it is as true in politicks as in morals, he that is unfaithful in little, will be unfaithful also in much. He who will not exercise the powers he has, will never properly use more extensive powers. The framing entirely new systems, is a work that requires vast attention; and it is much easier to guard an old one. It is infinitely better to reject one that is unfriendly to liberty, and rest for a while satisfied [772]with a system that is in some measure defective, than to set up a government unfriendly to the rights of states, and to the rights of individuals—one that is undefined in its powers and operations. Such is the government proposed by the federal convention and such, we trust, you will have the wisdom and firmness to reject."
Newspaper,No,Helvidius Priscus,,Independent Chronicle,,1/22/1788,"To the PUBLICK.The convention of Massachusetts has now met, and on their decisions, in a great measure, depends the fate of America. This state has, from the beginning of the contest with Britain, been distinguished for her wisdom in counsel, her zeal in opposition, and her energy in baffling the arts of power, and counteracting the intrigues of foreign and domestick foes, who wished not long ago to deprive her of her rights and to annihilate her as a state. On every trying occasion this state has stood foremost in the union, and done itself honour by its perseverance and independency of spirit—She has once more an opportunity of asserting her own dignity, by rejecting or essentially amending a system, calculated to involve [her] in a servitude, too complicated to be described, till its dreadful effects are experienced, when they may be forbidden to complain. But if they have chosen a set of delegates, of sufficient integrity and ability, they may yet be instrumental in saving all America from a thraldom, which may be foreseen without the aid of inspiration. But if there should be a temporising, an ignorant, or a designing majority, ready to accede, from fear, from folly, or interest, and bow the neck to the mishapen idol, held out for the adoration of the United States, it requires no uncommon sagacity to discover, that their [774]doings will involve this country in blood, render themselves the contempt of the best of their fellow-citizens, and the execration of posterity. We are told, that only 25 out of 130 members, convened in the three states of Pennsylvania, New-Jersey, and Delaware,2 had the wisdom, the firmness, and the patriotism, to reject the adoption of the proffered system of arbitrary government—an humiliating proof this of the local prejudices, the narrow views, and the selfish motives, by which mankind are too generally actuated—If all the wealth of America was to center in Boston, in consequence of its adoption; if Cambridge was to be made the federal city, and the fountain of all honour was circumscribed within the limits of ten miles—If the avaricious citizen, the ambitious courtier, and the ardent youth, from all parts of the continent, who are in quest of honour and emolument, were to repair and do homage for the dole3 in this favoured city, and to disseminate their wealth in its neighbourhood, no doubt the mechanicks, the macaronies, and the miserly part of Boston, and perhaps a majority in Convention, might think it good policy to adopt a system that would enrich and ennoble their own state—though even then gentlemen in the distant counties would have little reason to precipitate the plan. But view the reverse—Philadelphia is the central city; and a thousand circumstances will combine to sink the population, the wealth, and the consequence of Boston so that, both in a general and in a local view, we cannot but hope, that in a convention of three or four hundred men, of Massachusetts, a large majority will be found too wise to relinquish their own sovereignty and independence, and too just to violate the present excellent constitution of this state, and break the bands of the sacred compact, which the new arrangement would annihilate, and bring them down to the degraded dependents on a splendid monarchy, that will wring from them and their children their last farthing for its support. We have seen much scurrility and abuse indiscriminately cast on all who are not mad enough, with their eyes open, to put a yoke on their necks, which neither themselves nor posterity will be able to break. But we see neither reason, argument, or necessity for this country to renounce their best privileges, because officiously advised thereto by a set of men acting entirely out of the line of their commission. But the Landholder,4 without veracity—the New-England Damper,5 without, any thing—and a long etcetera of signatures, without principle or perspicuity, will never damp the ardour of liberty, nor check the energy of the able supporters of those genuine principles that mark, with dignity, those who have again stepped forth to defend, in its last struggle, that freedom and independence of spirit, which has made this country the admiration of the philosopher, the hero, and the statesman. It is not material whether the federal farmer belongs to Virginia or Kamtschatka6—whether he owns five hundred negroes,7 or is a man of no property at all—if his arguments are cogent—his reasonings conclusive—if the consequences of adopting the new system are fairly drawn, and the most certain despotism deduced from the principles of its fabrication, the intricacy and extent of its designs, and the fatal consequences of its operation. Nor is it of consequence to the publick, or to the general cause, whether mr. Lee is an enemy, or a devotee to the fame and to the merit, of general Washington8 or whether mr. Gerry refused his signature to the new constitution, in consistance with his former character, from enlarged and distinguished views to the general welfare, or from the pitiful consideration of a few publick securities in his pocket:9 nor will it alter the deformed visage of this deceptive system to inquire, whether mr. Gorham and mr. King embraced it with ardour from the sublimest feelings of patriotism and publick utility, or with an eye to the rich harvests that may be reaped on the Delaware.10 We are not contending for the characters of men, nor entering into the private disputes and local prejudices of individuals or of states—We wish to view every thing on the broad scale of independence to America—the sovereignty of the United States, and the freedom of the people, who have a just claim thereto, by the birth-right of nature, and the grant of heaven—sealed with the rich blood of martyrs in her cause.—Every member of the community ought diligently to read and to study the constitution of his country, and teach the rising generation to be free. By knowing their rights, they will soon perceive when they are violated, and be the better prepared to resist and defend them."

Letter,No,Silas Lee,George Thatcher,,,1/23/1788,"You ask, “does every body here take a side upon the federal Constitution?” I believe they do in general—some for & some against it—& I rather think, that there is a Majority of the Common people upon the latter—In the County of Lincoln, from what I collected at Hallowell [781]Court, I fancy the Majority are desidedly against the Measure—and it is said Judge Rice is among the number—he is a Member of our State Convention—his town Join mostly with him2—At I Hallowell only seven in favour of it—Vassalborough chose King Lovejoy to represent them in State Convention—but they afterwards found out that he was in favour of it’s adoption, & called another Meeting, turnd him out & chose another in his room who was desidedly against it3—The most reputable characters in that County, are, I believe, on what you will call the right side of the question—but the middling & common sort are on the opposite—In Cumberland & York there are not I believe a great Many that are violent on either side—Thompson Widgery & Nason, on the negative4—McLellan Fox & our Friend Hill on the affirmative5—but the latter as you may have been informd. does not attend Convention—however he is warmly engaged in the Cause—& is, I will assure you, a considerable Preacher in Israel—daily holding forth & publishing the Doctrine (some say of Mammon) (he says) of salvation—few believe, in all things—but fewer, I fancy, are converted—You ask, “what are the objections I have to the plan”?—Some. I will confess—but the want of a Bill of Rights is not one of them—that, I dont think would by any means be of any service to the people—nay I am in doubt whether such a Bill would not of itself make the Constitution far more dangerous than it now is—unless it curtailed some of the powers already proposed to be given, which would be children’s play indeed—like a man’s taking a note of hand, & then instantly giving a Receipt not only sufficient but on purpose to cut & defray it—a Bill of Rights, (in My opinion) would give up the controlment at least of every right not particularly secured therein—& therefore unless it mentioned & particularly secured every right not expressly granted away, instead of lessening the powers of Congress, such a Bill would actually enlarge them—for instead of the Constitution’s being the limits or boundary line of Congress, the Bill of Rights only would be the sacred barrier, or mark not to be exceeded—To say I have any serious & fixed objections, is wrong—But that I have very great doubts I will not deny—First, whether there is an equal & suficient representation of the people?—Slaves have ever been & still are considered as the property of their Masters, & therefore as such ought I think to be taxed, but not represented, any more than our oxen or horses—In the Southern States the slaves are very numerous, & therefore I fear will increase their Representatives to an undue proportion—Secondly—Whether even this Representation is properly Secured to the people?—The times places & manner of choosing Representatives & Senators shall be prescribed by each State—but [782]Congress may at any time make or alter such regulations, except as to place &c—pray tell me, what power have the several States in this particular?—to what, purpose was the place of chasing Senators excepted? I conceive the place to be very immaterial indeed & always wondered at the exception, but the time & manner may be of consequence—thirdly whether Sexennial elections are not dangerous?—unless guarded by a Rotation of office—something like the confederation6—but not exactly—suppose two successive Elections in Senators, & three in Representatives—would twelve years be too short a time for an ambitious Senator—and six for a designing Representative—fourthly—Whether the powers given to Congress are not too general—i.e. whether these words “and provide for the Common Defence & general welfare of the united States,” may not be construed to extend to every matter of legislation? Suppose a man, with the spirit of an englishman & a Republican, should find fault with the mode of administration, & should boldly publish his sentiments upon the subject—might not Congress say that the “general welfare of the states” required that a stop should be put to such daring publications?—which, however just—however well founded, would no doubt be complimented by Congress, with the appellation of Libels against Government—how would this effect the liberty of the press? fifthly whether, there are not implied powers? else, why are there any negatives, or restrictions?—viz why was it provided that no titles of Nobility should be granted? suppose that clause was omitted, could congress constitutionally grant such a title?—Sixthly, whether this constitution will not finally consolidate the states—or rather totally annihilate the State goverments?—Mr Willson if I mistake not averd. that the Congress could not exist without the State legislatures7—with deference to that great Man’s better Judgment, I differ far from him—I think that Congress have not only the power of Judging of their own Elections, but also the Sovereign Right of Regulating them at any time—If so, should all the States refuse to take any steps towards the choice of Senators & representatives, Congress may provide for their Election—I would not be understood to wholly disapprove of this power I think it might have been conditional—for if any State should thus neglect or refuse, then Congress ought to have this power—These are the principal causes of my doubts—I am apprehensive, from what you have wrote upon the subject, that you will say most if not all proceed from an unreasonable distrust of Mankind & Our Rulers & an Idea that Congress want only an opportunity to oppress, & tyrannize over the people—experience has taught mankind that there is danger in giving up too much power to rulers—indeed if there was not danger of their misusing their powers, there would be no need of any restraint [783]at all, or limitation to their power conduct—and if this Congress, that to be formd. under the new Constitution, is to consist of Men, incapable of an Idea, or a Motive, that does not teem with the greatest interest & welfare of the people—I say, if it is impossible for them to do otherwise than right—or than to make the true happiness of their Constituents, their only Study & aim, there is no need of any Constitution at all—all we have to do, is to give them the power of governing us at pleasure—they will certainly do right, therefore there can be no danger—If all Men were like My Dear Uncle I should be satisfied with such a plan—but I confess I have not so good an opinion of mankind as thus unlimitedly to give up all my rights—& chearfully to submit to whatever their humor or caprice should happen to suggest—I would suggest another Quere. Whether the Holders of State Securities or notes will not, upon the adoption of this Constitution, for the nonpayment thereof, have a remedy, by an action in the Federal Court against the state issuing the same?—You may think that all these objections are either ill founded, or have no weight—I will not pretend to say that that is not the Case—I wish only to be convinced of it, & shall instantly relinquish them—but adieu to politics for this time—"
Newspaper,No,Ezra,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/23/1788,"Mr. Printer, The question with regard to the adoption or rejection of the federal Constitution, now under consideration of the Convention, representing the several corporations of this Commonwealth, and now sitting in the town of Boston, is a question which ought to be maturely debated, and soberly judged upon; should this take place. I imagine the result must be, a rejection of the Constitution. It can hardly be supposed possible, that a people like this, after having undergone so much loss of blood and treasure, for the purpose of securing their liberties, should now vote them all away. I have heard several days debates of the Convention, particularly upon biennial elections, of the representatives in Congress. The speakers on the side of this article, (however learned) by no means shew fair play—for notwithstanding all their rhetorick, to set forth the benefit resulting therefrom—yet they equally and uniformly endeavour to keep out of view, the plainest and most natural construction of a subsequent section, which entirely deprives the people, (as a body) of the privilege, even of biennial elections. What security have we for it, when it is expressly provided, that Congress shall have it in their power, to alter the time and place of election? Will it not be in the power of Congress, to order the matter in such a manner, as effectually to deprive more than three fourths of the people of this privilege? Suppose for instance, the [786page icon]place chosen for election, should be the extreme eastern, or western borders of this Commonwealth—what will be the consequence? Why but a very small part of the people indeed will be represented.—This is plain and obvious—it needs no comment, and the plain, good sense of the Convention will not be led aside by all the sophistical reasonings, that are made use of for that purpose. Here our orators find themselves extremely difficulted—they find it hard to make people who have the proper use of their opticks, believe that black is white, whilst the object is before their eyes. Yet as no twig is so slender, but that a drowning man will grasp it—so they think, that although they cannot make them believe it, at present, yet they may be more successful, in an attempt to possess them, with a belief, that such a thing may happen hereafter. Although they themselves, and all others, are fully sensible, that our rulers for time past, have been no other than fallible men—yet in order to get this article down, they have no other way than to have recourse to a supposed INFALLIBILITY, of which our rulers are to be possessed under the new proposed Constitution. For although they will own, that this provision is made, and that it is in the power of Congress, to do as I have mentioned, yet say they, this was never intended—and it cannot be supposed, that Congress will ever be thus unreasonable. But who will be willing to trust his liberties upon a tenure so precarious as this? Where shall we find the man disposed to carry a favourite point, and has power enough in his hands to do it, and no one to call him to account therefore—I say where is the man but will do it? I know of no infallibility upon the earth, on this side Rome—and if we should send there, and import a number of INFALLIBLE Fathers, sufficient to constitute a Congress, I think there is very little prospect, but that through diversity of climate, and other concurring circumstances, they would soon loose their infallibility, and become as other men. Upon the whole, the thinking yeomanry of the country, are not to be cajoled out of their senses, by arguments like these. They are willing to have an energetick, federal government—but they are not willing to have one, which savours so strongly of aristocracy, as the present, and which they are sensible, must inevitably end in a government of this son. They are willing to have one upon the principles of republicanism—this they set out for—this they have obtained—and this they mean to keep—and those who now seem most anxious to deprive them of such a government, were at the beginning, foremost in the cry, and most vehemently urged them on to obtain it.—They (the people) are willing the federal Convention, should return to Philadelphia, and accomplish the business for which they were delegated, viz. to amend the Confederation.—They are willing to put power sufficient into the hands [787page icon]of the present Congress, to provide for the payment of the publick debt—and to set commerce upon an equal and fair footing through the States.—But they are not willing at the same time, to resign up all their liberties, into the hands of a number of designing men—(especially of the southern States) who, with others, it is evident, wish to make the common people, slaves to their mercenary purposes, wallow in luxury, and riot upon the spoils of the community. I am your’s, &c. EZRA."
Newspaper,No,Brutus (MA),,Independent Chronicle,George Washington,1/24/1788,"Mess’rs. ADAMS and NOURSE, I have this moment read in the Centinel, what is said to be a letter from General Washington. I have had, and do as yet entertain a high opinion of that illustrious Commander, and therefore have not yet brought myself to believe this to be his production, for he never could thus insult the country with a military arrogance. The letter says, that “if one State, however important it may conceive itself to be, or a minority of them, should suppose that they can dictate a Constitution to the Union, unless they have the power of applying the ULTIMO RATIO, to good effect, they will find themselves deceived.” The subject of the letter, is the proposed Constitution. A general Convention was appointed to add efficient articles to the confederation—but they have reported a form of government, as nearly like that of Great-Britain, as the circumstances of the country will admit. This if [791page icon]adopted, dissolves the confederation, and the people are called to deliberate on this momentous question. In the midst of their debates, is published a letter said to be from General Washington, holding up the idea, that if a majority of the States, agree to this New Constitution, the ULTIMO RATIO, that is the BAYONET, shall compel the minority to submit. To justify the threat, it is declared that government is at an end—. Are we then in a state of nature? Is there any other tyranny than that of compelling the weaker to submit to the stronger?—Is this what that illustrious General fought for? Are these his Laurels? If they are, he borrowed them from Casar."
Newspaper,No,,,Cumberland Gazette,,1/24/1788,"By papers received last evening from Boston, it appears that the Convention were, on Thursday last, debating on the 4th section of the Constitution: But as no question had been taken on either of them, it is impossible to determine whether the new plan of government will be adopted or rejected.—The report, lately circulated, that there was a decided majority against it, must therefore have been premature. Should the Convention proceed as slow and as sure through the whole, as through the four first sections of the constitution, it may be considered as a lucky circumstance that their operations happened to commence with the year; and luckier still, should they end with it. Why gentlemen should be opposed to the introduction of Mr. Gerry to the Convention, we are unable to determine.—His greatest enemies allow him to be a man of ability, integrity, and to use their own expressions, “a politician of mathematical nicety:” Add to this, his thorough knowledge of the subject in debate, acquired too from the source, the very fountain-head of information; and we may venture to conclude, that among those who would wish to exclude Mr. G. from the Convention, are to be found but very few honest enquirers after truth."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/25/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, That the new system, proposed for your adoption, is not founded in argument, but in party spirit, is evident from the whole behaviour of that party, who favour it. The following is a short, but genuine specimen of their reasoning. The South-Carolina legislature have established an unequal representation, and will not alter it:2 therefore Congress should be invested with an unrestrained power to alter [798]the time, manner and place of electing members into that body.3 Directly the contrary position should have been inferred. An elected assembly made an improper use of their right to controul elections, therefore such a right ought not to be lodged with them. It will be abided in ten instances, for one in which it will serve any valuable pin pose. It is said also that the Rhode Island assembly intend to abuse their power in this respect,4 therefore we should put Congress in a situation to abuse theirs. Surely this is not a kind of reasoning that, in the opinion of any indifferent person, can vindicate the fourth section. Yet we have heard it publickly advanced as being conclusive. The unlimitted power over trade, domestick as well as foreign, is another power that will more probably be applied to a bad than to a good purpose. That our trade was for the last year much in favour of the commonwealth is agreed by all parties. The freedom that every mar;, whether his capital is large or small, enjoys, of entering into any branch that pleases him, rouses a spirit of industry and exertion, that is friendly to commerce. It prevents that stagnation of business which generally precedes publick commotions. Nothing ought to be done to restrain this spirit. The unlimitted power over trade, however, is exceedingly apt to injure it. In most countries of Europe, trade has been confined by exclusive chapters. Exclusive companies are, in trade, pretty much like an aristocracy in government, and produces nearly as bad effects. An instance of in we have ourselves experienced. Before the revolution, we carried on to direct trade to India. The goods imported from that country, came to us through the medium of an exclusive company.5 Our trade in that. quarter is now respectable, and we receive several kinds of their goods at about half the former price.—But the evil of such companies does not terminate there. They always, by the greatness of their capital, have an undue influence on the government. In a republick, we ought to guard, as much as possible, against the predominance of any particular interest. It is the object of government to protect them all. When commerce is left to take its own course, the advantages of every class will be nearly equal.—But when exclusive privileges are given to any class, it will operate to the weakening of some other class connected with them. (Remainder next Tuesday.)"
Newspaper,No,The Yeomanry of Massachusetts,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/25/1788,"mr. allen, Please to insert the following in your FREE PAPER, and you will oblige a number of free born people. To the PUBLICK. Many are the arts made use of by our aristocratick gentlemen, to accommodate the federal constitution to the taste of the yeomanry of the country. But it is very unlucky for them, that they should be so far misled, as to attempt to trump up one thing which appears by no means to be founded in truth, viz. that none but placemen and pensioners [803]are opposed to it. This is so far from quadrating with truth, that we conceive it to be an absolute falshood. We would ask the disinterested part of the community just to look over the characters which are so fond of swallowing this creature, which exhibits all the pourtraits of an over-bearing aristocracy, and see if they are not chiefly composed of salary men and pensioners, and those who at least think themselves fair candidates for places of honour and emolument, whenever the aristocratick wheels of the federal chariot shall be set in motion.2 When we see the adherents to this constitution chiefly made up of civil and ecclesiastical gown men, and their dependents, the expedient they have hit upon is not likely to have the intended effect. There are many men destitute of eloquence, yet they can see and hear—They can think and judge, and are therefore not likely to be wheedled out of their senses by the sophistical reasonings of all the advocates for this new constitution in the country combined. We know this is not true; and as we well know the design of such representations, we would have those gentlemen know, that it will not take. They must pull upon some other string, or they must fail. Another thing they tell us, that the constitution must be good, from the characters which composed the Convention that framed it. It is graced with the names of a Washington and a Franklin. Illustrious names, we allow—worthy characters in civil society. Yet we cannot suppose them, to be infallible guides, neither yet that a man must necessarily incur guilt to himself merely by dissenting from them in opinion. We cannot think the noble general, has the same ideas with ourselves, with regard to the rules of right and wrong. We cannot think, he acts a very consistent part, or did through the whole of the contest with Great-Britain: who, notwithstanding he wielded the sword in defence of American liberty, yet at the same time was, and is to this day, living upon the labours of several hundreds of miserable Africans, as free born as himself; and some of them very likely descended from parents who, in point of property and dignity in their own country, might cope with any man in America. We do not conceive we are to be overborne by the weight of any names, however revered. “ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL;”3 if so, every man hath a natural and unalienable right to his own opinion, and, for asserting this right, ought not to be stigmatized with the epithets of tenacious and dogmatical. If we were to pin our faith on any sleeves but our own (without derogating in the least from the merit of any one of the Massachusetts delegates in the federal convention) we should be as likely to pin it on the sleeve of the hon. mr. Gerry as any one of them. But we mean to see with our own eyes, and thus seeing to act for ourselves. In this view, as a [804]tribute due from us to that hon. gentleman, we must acknowledge his tenderness, his care for the preservation of the liberties of the people, and his desire on all occasions to preserve them from invasion. This hon. gentleman was one who assisted in rearing the pillars of a republican government,4 he has ever since aided in the support of them, and thus hath acted a much more consistent part than those his brethren, who, after all the expense and fatigue of rearing the building, are now for razing the foundations, destroying instead of repairing the frame, and erecting another, which by no means can answer the good purpose of sheltering the people from storms. But, to lay aside metaphor— This gentleman is much more consistent, than those who are for turning our republican government into a hateful aristocracy. And we must think it very dishonourable in the aristocratical party, to treat the worthy gentleman, in the manner they have done in the publick papers: We can assure them it has been far from helping their cause. We do not wish to tire the publick, but would hint to those gentlemen, who would rob the people of their liberties, that their sophistry is not like to produce the effect. We are willing to have a federal constitution. We are willing another trial should be made; this may be done without derogating from the gentlemen, who composed the late convention. In framing a constitution for this commonwealth, two trials were made before one would stick. We are willing to relinquish so much, as to have a firm, energetick government, and this we are sensible may [be] done, without becoming slaves, to the capricious fancies of any sett of men whatever. It is argued, that there is no danger that the proposed rulers will be disposed to exercise any powers that this constitution puts into their hands, which may enable them to deprive the people of their liberties. But in case, say they, they should make such attempts, the people may, and will rise to arms and prevent it; in answer to which, we have only to say, we have had enough of fighting in the late war, and think it more eligible, to keep our liberties in our own hands, whilst it is in our power thus to do, than to place them in the hands of fallible men, like ourselves, who may if they please, entirely deprive us of them, and so we be at last reduced to the sad alternative of losing them forever, or recovering them back by the point of the sword. The aristocratick party are sensible, that these are the sentiments of the majority of the community, and their conduct plainly evinces the truth, of a well known ancient adage—“Nothing cuts like the truth.”"
Newspaper,No,Hampden (MA),,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/26/1788,"Mr. Russell, I have had no hand in the productions respecting the proposed plan of government—but I feel interested as a citizen.—I have waited to see if any motion might be made, or any disposition appear in the Convention, to prevent one of two evils taking place; the first is, that of rejecting the Constitution; the second is, that of adopting it by a bare majority. I am not contented with it as it now stands, my reasons are assigned:— I am not satisfied with the provision for amendments, as it stands in that system, because the amendments I propose, are such as two thirds of the Senate will perhaps never agree to—the indictment by grand jury, and trial of fact by a jury, is not so much set by in the southern States, as in the northern—the great men there, are too rich and important to serve on the juries, and the smaller are considered as not having consequence enough to try the others; in short, there can be no trial by peers there:—The middle States gain advantages by having the legal business done in one of them, which may prevent their leading men, from engaging seriously in amendments:—I therefore propose the adopting the Constitution, in the following manner, in which I conceive there will be great unanimity. THAT this Convention do adopt and ratify the Constitution, or frame of government for the United States of America, proposed by the Federal Convention, lately holden at Philadelphia; upon the following conditions, viz. That the first Congress which shall be holden under the same, shall before they proceed to exercise any powers possessed under the Constitution, excepting those of organizing themselves, and of establishing rules of procedure, take into consideration all amendments proposed by the Convention of this or any other State, and to make such amendments therein proposed as aforesaid, as any seven of the States shall agree to; and which amendments shall be considered as a part of the Constitution. And that the Senators and Representatives of the several States, shall set together in one body, and vote by States, in considering such amendments;—but the President or Vice-President elect, shall have no vote therein. The AMENDMENTS PROPOSED. FIRST. In the fourth section of the article of the Senate, strike out these words, “But Congress may, at any time, by law, make, or alter, such regulation, except as to the place for choosing Senators;” and insert these words, “But if any State shall refuse to prescribe time and place for such elections, Congress shall provide therefor by laws made for that purpose.” Remark—this amendment takes off the main objection made to this article, and gives Congress power to perpetuate its own existence. 2d. In the second clause of the ninth section insert the words—“And the Supreme Judicial Courts of the several States, and either Judge thereof, shall have power to issue this writ.” This secures the right of Habeas Corpus, without going to Pennsylvania for it.1 3d. In the eighth section of the powers of Congress, strike out the word, “Taxes.” This leaves the powers of impost and excise to Congress. And should war, or any other circumstance render internal taxes necessary to be in Congress, they may have the power granted hereafter. 4th. In the second section of the Judiciary Power, strike out the following words, “Between a State and a citizen of another State, between citizens of different States.” Laying a State liable to be sued, robs it of all its sovereignty, and in this case may lay the several States liable to be sued for their publick securities. 5th. In the second clause of the same section, strike out the words, “Both as to law and fact,” and add to that clause these words—Provided nevertheless, that all issues of fact shall be tried by a jury to be appointed according to standing laws made by Congress. This will preserve the inestimable right of a trial by jury.—This right is the democratical balance in the Judicary power, without it, in civil actions, no relief can be had against the High Officers of State, for abuse of private citizens; without this the English Constitution would be a tyranny.—See Judge Blackstone’s excellent Commentary on this privilege, in his third volume, page—2 6th. In the last clause in the same section next after the word State, insert these words, In, or near the County. This keeps up the idea of trial in the vicinity. See the Massachusetts declaration of rights on this point3—Also, that of other States, &c. 7th. At the end of the same clause, add these words—Provided that no person shall be held to answer to any charge of a criminal nature, unless it be upon indictment of a Grand Jury, appointed, sworn and charged according to known and standing laws. This is the greatest security against arbitrary power; without this, every person who opposes the violation of the constitutional right of the people, may be dragged to the bar, and tried upon a bare information of an Attorney-General.—The loss of this privilege carries with it the loss of every friend to the people.—There is no instance yet, in England, or in America, excepting in the Stuart’s reign, of a person’s being tried for his life, otherwise than upon indictment.4 It was attempted before the Revolution, but successfully oppossed."
Newspaper,No,An American,,American Herald,George Washington,1/28/1788,"We have been frequently advertised in the public papers, that General Washington, when he set his hand to the proposed Constitution, uttered these words—“THIS IS, PERHAPS, THE LAST TIME THE AMERICANS WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, COOLLY, TO SET DOWN, AND AGREE UPON A FORM OF GOVERNMENT.”12—The mode of expression from a Soldier,—from a Man, who, besides the Cincinnati, could call out many followers—from a Man, who stands in the public eye, the sole candidate for Chief Ruler of all the States: From such a one, it was as void of prudence as it was of foundation.—This has alarmed many patriots, and given pain to many of his friends—but they all feel a respectful delicacy towards that Great Man, and have therefore been silent, while they might have observed, that, as the motion made by Virginia for a General Convention, was so readily agreed to by all the States; and that as the people were so very zealous for a good Federal Government, though this plan, which was aided in its birth by that Great Man, should fail, the people could again set themselves down coolly, to make another.—The mode of expression might have been animadverted upon. THE LAST TIME they would have an OPPORTUNITY!—From whom do they receive this OPPORTUNITY, but from Heaven?—And who shall withhold the boon? Had not his letter appeared in the papers, fully explanatory of his ideas, still the regard all feel for him, might have constrained a decent silence. In this letter he says, “My decided opinion is, That there is no alternative between the adoption of it (that is the proposed Constitution) and anarchy.” One would suppose it very strange, that a Convention of fifty members, however respectable, should have such an opinion of their own sagacity, that when they had performed a task which they took upon themselves, they supposed that three millions of people could not amend it, or wish an alteration! and that unless this identical System, with every letter and figure thereof should be adopted, all Government would be at an end, “Old Chaos would come back again, and nothing but anarchy ensue!”—No new Convention, no new set of men can ever agree again, why?—Because miracles have ceased. But he goes on,—“If ONE STATE, however important it may conceive itself to be, or a minority of them, should suppose, that they can dictate a Constitution to the Union, unless they have the power of applying the ULTIMO RATIO, to good effect, they will find themselves deceived.”—One expression more ought to be attended to, in order to f id the General’s meaning:—“GENERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW [793page icon]SUSPENDED BY A THREAD—I MIGHT GO FURTHER, AND SAY, IT IS REALLY AT AN END.”—The proposed Constitution, is by the recommendation of the Convention, to be in force when nine States shall ratify it; if seven or eight out of 13 agree to it. yet the old Confederation remains until the people agree upon another.—But General Washington tells us, that the General Government is at an end already, and that unless the New Plan is adopted, anarchy and confusion takes place, and that a minority, unless they can apply the Ultimo ratio with good effect, will find themselves deceived. I do by no means wish to put an uncandid construction upon this letter, but I cannot resist the conclusion, that the General has declared, that this Constitution shall be supported by the ULTIMO RATIO, that is—by force. What is a Tyranny, but a Government forced by the stronger upon the weaker?—How imprudent then must the General be to make these declarations?—Does our soil produce no more Washington’s? Is there none left who would oppose the attempt to establish a Government by force?—Can we not call from the fields, the counters, the bar, and mechanics’ shops, any more Generals?—Is our soil exhausted?—And does any one suppose that the Americans, like the Romans, will submit to an Army merely because they have conquered a foreign enemy? The truth is that we cannot exist without a General Government, and that great thanks are due to the Convention for the plan they offer; but should the body of the people, or even a majority of the States, wish for alterations, before they ratify the work, surely they may be obtained without bloodshed, without the ULTIMO RATIO. And the majority with usual American candour, will yield to their brethren."

Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/29/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, This appears to be the universal effect of such establishments. A point of such magnitude ought, then, to be particularly guarded. In some respects if is beneficial that a system of commerce should be established by national authority. But if it is found, as it will upon examination, that most governments establish those companies, from occasional and temporal motives, and that they produce ill effects on government and on trade; the power ought in this respect to be restrained. As we are situated at one extreme of the empire, two or three such companies would annihilate the importance of our seaports, by transferring the trade to Philadelphia. With the decay of trade is connected the depreciation of lands and estates for want of a market for the produce. At present our exports are great and our manufactures are every day rising in importance. It seems to be agreed on all sides, that from the port of Boston only the balance was last year as much as [822]an hundred & fifty thousand pounds in favour of the state; a comparison of that and former years is far from proving the distressed state of commerce. Complaints in that respect are about as well founded as in most others. They are made to serve a present purpose, and when that is accomplished, there is no redress for the disappointment of the publick expectation. It becomes us then to consider well of the powers before we surrender them. There is no recovering them when once given. It is vain to flatter ourselves with the idea, that three quarters of the members of the new government will ever be for restraining their own power.2 If it was so easy as the federalists pretend to procure an alteration of the system after its adoption, I think, that it is a circumstance not much in its favour. In order to be perfect a constitution should be permanent. The new system sets out with a violation of the compact between the states. While it is in discussion, we ought to consider, that injustice never can be the basis of a good government. I have me with an account of one government uniformly supported by that principle, and I do not wish even my antagonists to become the subjects of that kingdom. In answer to the favourite remark of the federalists, that what is not given is reserved, it is sufficient to reply, that the framers of the proposed constitution have themselves thought it necessary to make an explicit reservation of the power to grant titles of nobility. Why did they reserve this point, if it would not otherwise have been given up? The conversation of the party is in direct opposition to any design ever to alter the system in favour of the liberties of the people. It is said that a constitution is itself a bill of rights. The fallacy of this position is easily shewn, but the length of this paper makes it necessary to postpone that part of the argument. At present we shall only observe, that a constitution does not necessarily point out any other dependencies than of the parts of the government upon each other, and not those between the government and people. Has Venice no constitution? Yet the people have no share in the government."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/29/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, As it is essentially necessary to the happiness of a free people, that the constitution of government should be established in [823]principles of truth, I have endeavoured, in a series of papers, to discuss the proposed form, with that degree of freedom which becomes a faithful citizen of the commonwealth. It must be obvious to the most careless observer, that the friends of the new plan appear to have nothing more in view than to establish it by a popular current, without any regard to the truth of its principles. Propositions, novel, erroneous and dangerous, are boldly advanced to support a system, which does not appear to be founded in, but in every instance to contradict, the experience of mankind. We are told, that a constitution is in itself a bill of rights; that all power not expressly given is reserved; that no powers are given to the new government which are not already vested in the state governments; and that it is for the security of liberty, that the persons elected should have the absolute controul over the time, manner and place of election. These, and an hundred other things of the like kind, though they have gained the hasty assent of men, respectable for learning and ability, are false in themselves, and invented merely to serve a present purpose. This will, I trust, clearly appear from the following considerations. It is common to consider man at first as in a state of nature, separate from all society. The only historical evidence, that the human species ever actually existed in this state, is derived from the book of Gen.1 There, it is said, that Adam remained a while alone. While the whole species was comprehended in his person was the only instance in which this supposed state of nature really existed. Ever since the completion of the first pair, mankind appear as natural to associate with their own species, as animals of any other kind herd together. Wherever we meet with their settlements, they are found in clans. We are therefore justified in saying, that a state of society is the natural state of man. Wherever we find a settlement of men, we find also some appearance of government. The state of government is therefore as natural to mankind as a state of society. Government and society appear to be co-eval. The most rude and artless form of government is probably the most ancient. This we find to be practised among the Indian tribes in America. With them the whole authority of government is vested in the whole tribe. Individuals depend upon their reputation of valour and wisdom to give them influence. Their government is genuinely democratical. This was probably the first kind of government among mankind, as we meet with no mention of any other kind, till royalty was introduced in the person of Nimrod. Immediately after that time, the Asiatick nations seem to have departed from the simple democracy, which is still retained by their American brethren, and universally adopted the kingly form. We do indeed meet with some vague rumors [824]of an aristocracy in India so late as the time of Alexander the great. But such stories are altogether uncertain and improbable. For in the time of Abraham, who lived about sixteen hundred years before Alexander, all the little nations mentioned in the Mosaick history appear to be governed by kings. It does not appear from any accounts of the Asiatick kingdoms that they have practised at all upon the idea of a limitted monarchy. The whole power of society has been delegated to the kings: and though they may be said to have constitutions of government, because the succession to the crown is limitted by certain rules, yet the people are not benefitted by their constitutions, and enjoy no share of civil liberty. The first attempt to reduce republicanism to a system, appears to be made by Moses when he led the Israelites out of Egypt. This government stood a considerable time, about five centuries, till in a frenzy the people demanded a king, that they might resemble the nations about them. They were dissatisfied with their judges, and instead of changing the administration, they madly changed their constitution. However they might flatter themselves with the idea, that an high spirited people could get the power back again when they pleased; they never did get it back, and they fared like the nations about them. Their kings tyrannized over them for some centuries, till they fell under a foreign yoke. This is the history of that nation. With a change of names, it describes the progress of political changes in other countries. The people are dazzled with the splendour of distant monarchies, and a desire to share their glory induces them to sacrifice their domestick happiness. From this general view of the state of mankind it appears, that all the power[s] of government originally reside in the body of the people; and that when they appoint certain persons to administer the government, they delegate all the powers of government not expressly reserved. Hence it appears, that a constitution does not in itself imply any more than a declaration of the relation which the different parts of the government bear to each other, but does not in any degree imply security to the rights of individuals. This has been the uniform practice. In all doubtful cases the decision is in favour of the government. It is therefore impertinent to ask by what right government exercises powers not expressly delegated. Mr. Wilson, the great oracle of federalism, acknowledges, in his speech to the Philadelphians, the truth of these remarks, as they respect the state governments, but attempts to set up a distinction between them and the continental government.2 To any body who will be at the trouble to read the new system, it is evidently [825]in the same situation as the state constitutions now possess. It is a compact among the people for the purposes of government, and not a compact between states. It begins in the name of the people and not of the states. It has been shown in the course of this paper, that when people institute government, they of course delegate all rights not expressly reserved. In our state constitution the bill of rights consists of thirty articles.3 It is evident therefore that the new constitution proposes to delegate greater powers than are granted to our own government, sanguine as the person was who denied it. The complaints against the separate governments, even by the friends of the new plan, are not that they have not power enough, but that they are disposed to make a bad use of what power they have. Surely then they reason badly, when they purpose to set up a government possess’d of much more extensive powers than the present, and subject to much smaller checks. Bills of rights, reserved by authority of the people, are, I believe, peculiar to America. A careful observance of the abuse practised in other countries has had its just effect by inducing our people to guard against them. We find the happiest consequences to flow from it. The separate governments know their powers, their objects, and operations. We are therefore not perpetually tormented with new experiments. For a single instance of abuse among us there are thousands in other countries. On the other hand, the people know their rights, and feel happy in the possession of their freedom, both civil and political. Active industry is the consequence of their security; and within one year the circumstances of the state and of individuals have improved to a degree never before known in this commonwealth. Though our bill of rights does not, perhaps, contain all the cases in which power might be safely reserved, yet it affords a protection to the persons and possessions of individuals not known in any foreign country. In some respects the power of government is a little too confined. In many other countries we find the people resisting their govern ours for exercising their power in an unaccustomed mode. But for want of a bill of rights the resistance is always by the principles of their government, a rebellion which nothing but success can justify. In our constitution we have aimed at delegating the necessary powers of government and confining their operation to beneficial purposes. At present we appear to have come very near the truth. Let us therefore have wisdom and virtue enough to preserve it inviolate. It is a state contrivance, to get the people into a passion, in order to make them sacrifice their liberty. Repentance always comes, but it comes too late. Let us not flatter ourselves that we [826]shall always have good men to govern us. If we endeavour to be like other nations we shall have more bad men than good ones to exercise extensive powers. That circumstance alone will corrupt them. While they fancy themselves the vicegerents of God, they will resemble him only in power, but will always depart from his wisdom and goodness."
Newspaper,No,Massachusettensis,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/29/1788,"That the new constitution cannot make a union of states, but only of individuals, and proposes the beginning of one new society, one new government in all matters, is evident from these considerations, viz. It marks no line of distinction between separate state matters, and what [831]would of right come under the controul of the powers ordained in a union of states. To say that no line could be drawn, is giving me the argument. For what can be more absurd than to say, that states are united where a general power is established that extends to all objects of government, that is, all that exist among the people who make the compact? and is it not clear, that Congress have the right, (by the constitution) to make general laws for proving all acts, records, proceedings, and the effect thereof, in what are now called the states? Is it possible after this that any state act can exist, or any publick business be done, without the direction and sanction of Congress, or by virtue of some subordinate authority? If not, how, in the nature of things, can there be a union of states? Does not the uniting of states, as states, necessarily imply the existence of separate state powers? Again, the constitution makes no consistent, adequate provision for amendments to be made to it by states, as states: not they who draught the amendments (should any be made) but they who ratify them, must be considered as making them. Three fourths of the legislatures of the several states, as they are now called, may ratify amendments, that is, if Congress see fit, but not without. Where is then any independent state authority recognized in the plan? And if there is no independent state authority, how can there be a union of states? But is it not a question of importance, why the states, in their present capacity, cannot ratify the original? I mean, why the legislatures of the several states cannot do this business? I wish to be informed where to find the regular exercise and legal sanction of state power, if the legislative authority of the state is set aside? Have the people some other constitutional means by which they can give their united voice in state affairs? This leads me to observe, that should the new constitution be received as it stands, it can never be proved that it originated from any proper state authority: because there is no such authority recognized either in the form of it, or in the mode fixed upon for its ratification. It says, “We the people of the United States,” &c. make this constitution; but does this phrase, “We the people of the United States,” prove that the people are acting in state character, or that the several states must of necessity exist with separate governments? Who that understands the subject will believe either? Suppose the same people should agree to be united with Canada, by some instrument of government, and say, we the people of the United States of America agree so and so respecting this union—Would this way of characterizing themselves, amount to a proof that they exercised state authority in this matter? and that the union was a proper union of state powers? No, verily; it is the tenor of the compact that must determine whether this was a union of states, or whether the [832]people were taken under the government of Canada as individuals. Why does not the constitution begin something to this purpose, viz. We the people of the state of New-York, of the state of New-Jersey, &c. in order to form a more perfect union of these several states of America, do, by virtue of the constitutional powers we are now in possession of, make and ordain this constitution. I know that a preamble of this kind would not be conformable to a design of dissolving the state governments; but whether it would not be material to a plan that was intended for, and calculated to make a union of the states, I leave to the judgment of the impartial publick; I mean those who are versed in these matters: for my part, I am inclined to think that, laying an original foundation of society, and uniting two or more societies, are very different things. Again, what is said about the United States guaranteeing a republican form of government to each state in the union, is a mere fallacy. After the adoption of the new system, the United States can be United States only in consequence of the powers vested in Congress. Why was it not said, that the United States in Congress assembled shall protect each state in the union in the enjoyment of their separate forms of government? But this would not correspond with having no line of distinction between the state governments and the general government. Make the best of it, this guaranteeing implies, that new forms of government for the states, is a condition in the general agreement. And does not this imply that the old forms are given up, or annihilated, and that there is no security for the new ones, only what is provided in the new constitution? and that is just none at all; for it does not say that Congress shall take care of this affair. But suppose that Congress represents a union of states—would it not be a curiosity in the political world, that these states must depend for their very existence upon a power of their own establishing? Should it come to this, what must the separate governments be but powers ordained by Congress, and consequently under the controul of that body? Can this be uniting the American states? No—it amounts to beginning the American publick world anew. Again, the plan does not acknowledge any constitutional state authority as necessary in the ratification of it. This work is to be done by a mere convention, only in consequence of mere recommendation; which does by no means amount to a proper state act. As no state act can exist independent of the supreme authority of the state, and this authority is out of the question in the ratification of the new constitution; it clearly follows, that the ratifying of it, by a mere convention, is no proper state business. To conclude, the people may make the original, but the people have no right to alter it. Congress may order this [833]matter just as they please, and consequently have who they please elected for governours or representatives, not of the states, but of the people; and not of the people as men, but as property—Not the least remedy pointed out in the plan against this or any other calamity, which may come upon the people, in consequence of the wanton, unrighteous use of congressional power."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/30/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and fellow Citizens, Whoever has attended the debates of the Convention, must already be convinced, that the magnitude of the object, and the anxiety of the members, whether for or against the system as it stands, has produced a party spirit which augurs no good. It has now become a struggle for conquest; rather than for conviction: And great as the characters are which compose the Convention, their talents are more employed to make proselytes in favour or against than to investigate precisely and explain clearly the merits and demerits of the proposed Constitution. It must likewise appear, that so many able and eloquent speakers as there are in favour of it, from [834]the supreme executive, judicial and legislative departments, as well as from the bar, desk,2 medical and military professions, that there is not a prospect of doing justice to the objections against the plan. Should it, therefore, in this state of affairs, be carried by a small majority, what must be the consequences? They are too apparent, and too ruinous to contemplate, and every one is left to form his idea of them. The same would probably be the effect of a negative, and the farther we proceed in this business, the more evident is it, that an adjournment until the sense of Virginia and other States can be known, is not only proper, but indispensibly necessary for the peace and welfare of this State.—To persuade the people that this system will produce advantages which will never flow from it, or to conceal from them the burthen and coercion that will result from it, will be impolitick in the extreme, for the deception must appear as soon as the plan is administered, and the new administration itself will be overwhelmed, and all federal government be prostrated by an enraged and disappointed people. I am sensible that many worthy men are for adopting this plan, not because they approve of it, but from an idea that, we shall never obtain another; but what reason is there for this apprehension? The whole Continent are desirous of an efficient federal government—The first constitution proposed to the people of Massachusetts was rejected by them; it originated improperly as this did, and if it had not, it was not a good one. The people therefore made a second attempt, and succeeded in it; and is there not the same reason to hope for success in the present case? Or if we fail, that the attempt will probably make us unanimous in adopting this system? But is it not extraordinary, that a Constitution should be proposed by gentlemen, who had no authority whatever to form it—that they should dissolve themselves without knowing the objections of the people, and that the latter should now be told, they must take this or have none?—This may be language adapted to slaves, but not to freemen. By my last,3 I think it must fully appear, that the apportionment of representatives by the new system, is to be either according to numbers or property—If according to numbers, that we are to commit ourselves by a unequal representation to the States who are peopled in a great measure with slaves, and if according to property that we are to adopt in our representative branch the most extraordinary principle for establishing an aristocracy, that ever was imposed on a free people. The Constitution further provides, that “the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term often years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.” The whole number of freemen [835]and slaves at this time, according to the best information, is about two millions seven hundred thousand, of which six hundred thousand at least are slaves—two millions one hundred thousand freemen then, and three hundred and sixty thousand, being three fifths of the slaves, will make the present enumeration two millions four hundred and sixty thousand.4 If we suppose (what considering the continual emigrations from the old to the new States cannot be admitted) that in every twenty years we shall double our numbers, at the end of three years the enumeration will be two millions eight hundred and twenty-nine thousand, and what is to be done with this enumeration? The Constitution in the next paragraph provides, that “the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one representative, and until such enumeration shall be made, New-Hampshire shall be intitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight.” &c. &c. The people then are called upon to ratify a Constitution, which provides that they shall never have above one representative for thirty thousand inhabitants, without providing that they shall have one for that number: This clause, whilst it restrains the new government from allowing more than one representative to the number mentioned, authorizes it by making the rule of apportionment one or two hundred thousand inhabitants for each representative, to reduce their number to twenty-eight or even to fourteen. This is so clear, that the warmest advocate for the new system will risque his reputation for candour by denying it. If there was no discretionary power intended to be lodged in the new Congress, to reduce the number of representatives lower than one for every thirty thousand inhabitants, it would have been provided, that “the number of representatives” shall be at least one for every thirty thousand; and not as it now stands, “that it shall not exceed one” for that number. It may be said, perhaps, that the increase of the inhabitants will be such hereafter as that it will be necessary for Congress to have the power to make the rule of apportionment higher than thirty thousand; but why then was it not provided, that the people should be allowed one representative for every thirty thousand, until the representatives amounted to a certain number? Even two hundred representatives for a legislature, invested as this is to be, with almost unlimited powers, over the lives, liberties and property of the citizens of these States, is not too much at this early period:—Why should we then, having but sixty-five representatives, intrust Congress with a power to reduce this to a much less number? Perhaps it will be said, there is only a possibility of this evil; but in the progress of these papers I think it will appear there is a probability if not a certainty, that when Congress shall have established their revenue-acts and standing army, which will be [836]accomplished in a few years, they will reduce the number of representatives so low, and regulate their elections in such a manner, as effectually to destroy the representation of the people. Some indeed may say, that if it was greater than at present, it would be expensive and burthensome; but this is too trifling an objection to deserve refutation; for the people of the country know well, that their greatest security against a tyrannical government consists in a full and free representation—full as to number of representatives—free as to the right of election, and they are not thus to be bubbled out of their liberties. Should it be admitted, that at the end of three years there will be a representative for every thirty thousand inhabitants, the whole number in the federal legislature will then be ninety-four, and this State’s proportion thirteen, and after that time no alteration will be made until the year eighteen hundred and one: And are the citizens of this State disposed to commit every thing dear to them, for the space of thirteen years, to a government, constituted as the new one is to be, with only eight representatives for part of the time, and thirteen for the remainder of it?—Are the States having slaves, to have according to the number of freemen a much greater representation than this State? And if there had been no objection of this kind, are the State governments to be subject to annihilation, and when this is accomplished, is the principle of property, which is now contended for as the rule of apportionment, to be then the rule for electing representatives, whereby sixty or a less number of wealthy men, may elect as many representatives as sixty thousand yeomen? What is the number of freemen in Great-Britain, and how many representatives have they? The number, I think, is computed to be about eight millions, and “the number of English representatives, is five hundred and thirteen, and of Scots forty-five, in all five hundred and eighty-eight.” In this proportion we should have a representative for every thirteen thousand six hundred inhabitants, and this State would have thirty representatives in the new Congress. Will the people of this State intrust themselves to a government which will have the power, and every motive to reduce the number of representatives to one half or to one quarter of what they are now to be, and thus to deprive the citizens of their best security for liberty? I think they will not, and that it ought not to be expected of them. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,An Honest Man,,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/1/1788,"Mr. PRINTER, I am a labouring man. and therefore can hope for nothing in this world but to get my living by industry; but I feel a concern for the publick good, as well as those in higher station. A great deal has been written about the new constitution—Now I will, once for all, speak my mind plainly,—which is, that we do now adopt the constitution, and chuse mr. Adams, (an old tried patriot,) for a senator, and mr. Gerry (who thinks some amendments should be made) for a representative, in the new Congress;1 and I don’t doubt they will alter what may want mending, and all the people be satisfied.—Think of this, good folks!"
Newspaper,No,,,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/1/1788,"To the EDITOR of the MASSACHUSETTS GAZETTE. SIR, Feeling the want of a good and energetick national government was not among the last of my fellow–citizens in giving my voice in favour of the new system, now under consideration; but I confess my partiality proceeded principally from the unanimity and respectability of the honourable composers of it. Since I have attended to the debates on the subject, both in convention and the publications abroad, especially a pamphlet, intitled, “Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican.” I am led to apprehend I was utterly mistaken as to my first ideas; and conclude, with this inimitable author and candid reasoner, that—“Time should be taken fully to examine and consider the system proposed. Men, who feel easy in their circumstances, and such as are not sanguine in their expectations, relative to the consequences of the proposed change, will remain quiet under the existing governments. Many commercial and monied men, who are uneasy, not without just cause, ought to be respected; and, by no means, unreasonably disappointed in their expectations and hopes; but as to those who expect employments under the new constitution; as to those weak and ardent men, who always expect to be gainers by revolutions, and whose lot it generally is to get out of one difficulty into another, they are very little to be regarded: and as to those who designedly avail themselves of this weakness and ardour, they are to be despised. It is natural for men, who wish to hasten the adoption of a measure, to tell us, now is the crisis—now is the critical moment which must be seized, or all will be lost: and to shut the door against free inquiry, whenever conscious the thing presented has defects in it, which time and investigation will probably discover. This has been the custom of tyrants and their dependants, in all ages. If it is true, what has been so often said, that the people of this country cannot change their condition for the worse, I presume it still behoves them to endeavour deliberately to change it for the better. [841]The fickle and ardent, in any community, are the proper tools for establishing despotick government. But it is deliberate and thinking men, who must establish and secure governments on free principles. Before they decide on the plan proposed, they will inquire whether it will probably be a blessing or a curse to this people.” “I think the honest and substantial part of the community, will wish to see this system altered, permanency and consistency given to the constitution we shall adopt; and therefore they will be anxious to apportion the powers to the features and organization of the government, and to see abuse in the exercise of power more effectually guarded against. It is suggested, that state officers, from interested motives, will oppose the constitution itself—I see no reason for this, their places in general will not be affected, but new openings to offices and places of profit, must evidently be made by the adoption of the constitution in its present form.”1"
Newspaper,No,Mercy Otis Warren,,American Herald,,2/2/1788,"Mankind may amuse themselves with theoretick systems of liberty, and trace its social and moral effects on sciences, virtue, industry, and every improvement of which the human mind is capable; but we can only discern its true value by the practical and wretched effects of slavery; and thus dreadfully will they be realized, when the inhabitants of the Eastern States are dragging out a miserable existence, only on the gleanings of their fields; and the Southern, blessed with a softer and more fertile climate, are languishing in hopeless poverty; and when asked, what is become of the flower of their crop, and the rich produce of their farms–they may answer in the hapless stile of the Man of La Mancha,–“The steward of my Lord has seized and sent it to Madrid.”1–Or, in the more literal language of truth, The exigencies of government require that the collectors of the revenue should transmit it to the Federal City. Animated with the firmest zeal for the interest of this country, the peace and union of the American States, and the freedom and happiness of a people who have made the most costly sacrifices in the cause of liberty,–who have braved the power of Britain, weathered the convulsions of war, [275]and waded thro’ the blood of friends and foes to establish their independence and to support the freedom of the human mind; I cannot silently witness this degradation without calling on them, before they are compelled to blush at their own servitude, and to turn back their languid eyes on their lost liberties–to consider, that the character of nations generally changes at the moment of revolution.–And when patriotism is discountenanced and publick virtue becomes the ridicule of the sycophant–when every man of liberality, firmness, and penetration, who cannot lick the hand stretched out to oppress, is deemed an enemy to the State–then is the gulph of despotism set open, and the grades to slavery, though rapid, are scarce perceptible–then genius drags heavily its iron chain–science is neglected, and real merit flies to the shades for security from reproach–the mind becomes enervated, and the national character sinks to a kind of apathy with only energy sufficient to curse the breast that gave it milk, and as an elegant writer observes, “To bewail every new birth as an encrease of misery, under a government where the mind is necessarily debased, and talents are seduced to become the panegyrists of usurpation and tyranny.” He adds, “that even sedition is not the most indubitable enemy to the publick welfare; but that its most dreadful foe is despotism, which always changes the character of nations for the worse, and is productive of nothing but vice, that the tyrant no longer excites to the pursuits of glory or virtue; it is not talents, it is baseness and servility that he cherishes, and the weight of arbitrary power destroys the spring of emulation.”(a)2 If such is the influence of government on the character and manners, and undoubtedly the observation is just, must we not subscribe to the opinion of the celebrated Abbé Mablé? “That there are disagreeable seasons in the unhappy situation of human affairs, when policy requires both the intention and the power of doing mischief to be punished; and that when the senate proscribed the memory of Cæsar they ought to have put Anthony to death, and extinguished the hopes of Octavius.”3 Self defence is a primary law of nature, which no subsequent law of society can abolish; this primœval principle, the immediate gift of the Creator, obliges every one to remonstrate against the strides of ambition, and a wanton lust of domination, and to resist the first approaches of tyranny, which at this day threaten to sweep away the rights for which the brave sons of America have fought with an heroism scarcely paralleled even in ancient republicks. It may be repeated, they have purchased it with their blood, and have gloried in their independence with a dignity of spirit, which has made them the admiration of philosophy, the pride of America, and the wonder of Europe. It has been observed, with great propriety, that “the virtues and vices of a people when a revolution happens in their government, are the measure of the liberty or slavery they ought to expect–An heroic love for the publick good, a profound reverence for the laws, a contempt of riches, and a noble haughtiness of soul, are the only foundations of a free [276]government.”(b)4 Do not their dignified principles still exist among us? Or are they extinguished in the breasts of Americans, whose fields have been so recently crimsoned to repel the potent arm of a foreign Monarch, who had planted his engines of slavery in every city, with design to erase the vestiges of freedom in this his last asylum. It is yet to be hoped, for the honour of human nature, that no combinations either foreign or domestick have thus darkned this Western hemisphere.–On these shores freedom has planted her standard, diped in the purple tide that flowed from the veins of her martyred heroes; and here every uncorrupted American yet hopes to see it supported by the vigour, the justice, the wisdom and unanimity of the people, in spite of the deep-laid plots, the secret intrigues, or the bold effrontery of those interested and avaricious adventurers for place, who intoxicated with the ideas of distinction and preferment, have prostrated every worthy principle beneath the shrine of ambition. Yet these are the men who tell us republicanism is dwindled into theory–that we are incapable of enjoying our liberties–and that we must have a master.–Let us retrospect the days of our adversity, and recollect who were then our friends; do we find them among the sticklers for aristocratick authority? No, they were generally the same men who now wish to save us from the distractions of anarchy on the one hand, and the jaws of tyranny on the other; where then were the class who now come forth importunately urging that our political salvation depends on the adoption of a system at which freedom spurns?–Were not some of them hidden in the corners of obscurity, and others wrapping themselves in the bosom of our enemies for safety? Some of them were in the arms of infancy; and others speculating for fortune, by sporting with public money; while a few, a very few of them were magnanimously defending their country, and raising a character, which I pray heaven may never be sullied by aiding measures derogatory to their former exertions. But the revolutions in principle which time produces among mankind, frequently exhibits the most mortifying instances of human weakness; and this alone can account for the extraordinary appearance of a few names, once distinguished in the honourable walks of patriotism, but now found on the list of the Massachusetts assent to the ratification of a Constitution,5 which, by the undefined meaning of some parts, and the ambiguities of expression in others, is dangerously adapted to the purposes of an immediate aristocratic tyranny; that from the difficulty, if not impracticability of its operation, must soon terminate in the most uncontrouled despotism. All writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind witness the truth of these political axioms, that man is born free and possessed of certain unalienable rights–that government is instituted for the protection, safety, and happiness of the people, and not for the profit, honour, or private interest of any man, family, or class of men–That the origin of all power is in the people, and that they have an incontestible [277]right to check the creatures of their own creation, vested with certain powers to guard the life, liberty and property of the community: And if certain selected bodies of men, deputed on these principles, determine contrary to the wishes and expectations of their constituents, the people have an undoubted right to reject their decisions, to call for a revision of their conduct, to depute others in their room, or if they think proper, to demand further time for deliberation on matters of the greatest moment: it therefore is an unwarrantable stretch of authority or influence, if any methods are taken to preclude this reasonable, and peaceful mode of enquiry and decision. And it is with inexpressible anxiety, that many of the best friends to the Union of the States–to the peaceable and equal participation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity of this country, behold the insiduous arts, and the strenuous efforts of the partisans of arbitrary power, by their vague definitions of the best established truths, endeavoring to envelope the mind in darkness the concomitant of slavery, and to lock the strong chains of domestic despotism on a country, which by the most glorious and successful struggles is but newly emancipated from the sceptre of foreign dominion.–But there are certain seasons in the course of human affairs, when Genius, Virtue, and Patriotism, seems to nod over the vices of the times, and perhaps never more remarkably, than at the present period; or we should not see such a passive disposition prevail in some, who we must candidly suppose, have liberal and enlarged sentiments; while a supple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous homage to the opinions of those who by the most precipitate steps are treading down their dear bought privileges; and who are endeavouring by all the arts of insinuation, and influence, to betray the people of the United States, into an acceptance of a most complicated system of government; marked on the one side with the dark, secret and profound intrigues, of the statesman, long practised in the purlieus of despotism; and on the other, with the ideal projects of young ambition, with its wings just expanded to soar to a summit, which imagination has painted in such gawdy colours as to intoxicate the inexperienced votary, and send him rambling from State to State, to collect materials to construct the ladder of preferment. [1.] But as a variety of objections to the heterogeneous phantom, have been repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the best abilities and intentions; I will not expatiate long on a Republican form of government, founded on the principles of monarchy–a democratick branch with the features of aristocracy–and the extravagance of nobility pervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the poverty of peasantry hanging heavily on them, and insurmountable, from their taste for expence, unless a generous provision should be made in the arrangement of the civil list, which may enable them with the champions of their cause to “sail down the new pactolean channel.”6 Some gentlemen with laboured zeal, have spent much time in urging the necessity of government, from the embarrassments [278]of trade–the want of respectability abroad and confidence in the public engagements at home:–These are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few who do not unite in the general wish for the restoration of public faith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and industry, under a lenient, peaceable and energetick government: But the most sagacious advocates for the party have not by fair discusion, and rational argumentation, evinced the necessity of adopting this many–headed monster; of such motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace a feature of Democratick or Republican extract; nor have its friends the courage to denominate it a Monarchy, an Aristocracy, or an Oligarchy, and the favoured bantling must have passed through the short period of its existence without a name, had not Mr. Wilson, in the fertility of his genius, suggested the happy epithet of a Federal Republic.7–But I leave the field of general censure on the secrecy of its birth, the rapidity of its growth, and the fatal consequences of suffering it to live to the age of maturity, and will particularize some of the most weighty objections to its passing through this continent in a gigantic size.–It will be allowed by every one that the fundamental principle of a free government, is the equal representation of a free people–And I will first observe with a justly celebrated writer, “That the principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the absolute rights which were vested in them by the immediate laws of nature, but which could not be preserved in peace, without the mutual intercourse which is gained by the institution of friendly and social communities.”8 And when society has thus deputed a certain number of their equals to take care of their personal rights, and the interest of the whole community, it must be considered that responsibility is the great security of integrity and honour; and that annual election is the basis of responsibility.–Man is not immediately corrupted, but power without limitation, or amenability, may endanger the brightest virtue–whereas a frequent return to the bar of their Constituents is the strongest check against the corruptions to which men are liable, either from the intrigues of others of more subtle genius, or the propensities of their own hearts,–and the gentlemen who have so warmly advocated in the late Convention of the Massachusetts, the change from annual to biennial elections;9 may have been in the same predicament, and perhaps with the same views that Mr. Hutchinson once acknowledged himself, when in a letter to Lord Hillsborough, he observed, “that the grand difficulty of making a change in government against the general bent of the people had caused him to turn his thoughts to a variety of plans, in order to find one that might be executed in spite of opposition,” and the first he proposed was that, “instead of annual, the elections should be only once in three years:”10 but the Minister had not the hardiness to attempt such an innovation, even in the revision of colonial charters: nor has any one ever defended Beinnial, Triennial, or Septennial, Elections, either in the British House of Commons, or in the debates of Provincial assemblies, [279]on general and free principles: but it is unnecessary to dwell long on this article, as the best political writers have supported the principles of annual elections with a precision, that cannot be confuted, though they may be darkned, by the sophistical arguments that have been thrown out with design, to undermine all the barriers of freedom. 2. There is no security in the profered system, either for the rights of conscience, or the liberty of the Press: Despotism usually while it is gaining ground, will suffer men to think, say, or write what they please; but when once established, if it is thought necessary to subserve the purposes of arbitrary power, the most unjust restrictions may take place in the first instance, and an imprimator on the Press in the next, may silence the complaints, and forbid the most decent remonstrances of an injured and oppressed people. 3. There are no well defined limits of the Judiciary Powers, they seem to be left as a boundless ocean, that has broken over the chart of the Supreme Lawgiver “thus far shalt thou go and no further,”11 and as they cannot be comprehended by the clearest capacity, or the most sagacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to describe the dangers with which they are replete. 4. The Executive and the Legislative are so dangerously blended as to give just cause of alarm, and every thing relative thereto, is couched in such ambiguous terms–in such vague and indifinite expression, as is a sufficient ground without any other objection, for the reprobation of a system, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear investigation. 5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil causes.–This mode of trial the learned Judge Blackstone observes, “has been coeval with the first rudiments of civil government, that property, liberty and life, depend on maintaining in its legal force the constitutional trial by jury.” He bids his readers pauze, and with Sir Matthew Hale observes, how admirably this mode is adapted to the investigation of truth beyond any other the world can produce.12 Even the party who have been disposed to swallow, without examination, the proposals of the secret conclave, have started on a discovery that this essential right was curtailed; and shall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to our Saxon ancestors–that has been a part of the law of nations, even in the fewdatory systems of France, Germany and Italy–and from the earliest records has been held so sacred, both in ancient and modern Britain, that it could never be shaken by the introduction of Norman customs, or any other conquests or change of government–shall this inestimable privilege be relinquished in America–either thro’ the fear of inquisition for unaccounted thousands of public monies in the hands of some who have been officious in the fabrication of the consolidated system, or from the apprehension that some future delinquent possessed of more power than integrity, may be called to a trial by his peers in the hour of investigation? 6. Though it has been said by Mr. Wilson13 and many others, that a Standing–Army is necessary for the dignity and safety of America, yet freedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the Despot, may draw out his dragoons to suppress the murmurs of a few, who may yet cherish those sublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead to the best improvement of the human mind. It is hoped this country may yet be governed by milder methods than are usually displayed beneath the bannerets of military law.–Standing armies have been the nursery of vice and the bane of liberty from the Roman legions, to the establishment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cortes of Spain, to the planting the British cohorts in the capitals of America:–By the edicts of authority vested in the sovereign power by the proposed constitution, the militia of the country, the bulwark of defence, and the security of national liberty is no longer under the controul of civil authority; but at the rescript of the Monarch, or the aristocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous sums that will be necessary to support the civil list–to maintain the regalia of power–and the splendour of the most useless part of the community, or they may be sent into foreign countries for the fulfilment of treaties, stipulated by the President and two thirds of the Senate. 7. Notwithstanding the delusory promise to guarantee a Republican form of government to every State in the Union–If the most discerning eye could discover any meaning at all in the engagement, there are no resources left for the support of internal government, or the liquidation of the debts of the State. Every source of revenue is in the monopoly of Congress, and if the several legislatures in their enfebled state, should against their own feelings be necessitated to attempt a dry tax for the payment of their debts, and the support of internal police, even this may be required for the purposes of the general government. 8. As the new Congress are empowered to determine their own salaries, the requisitions for this purpose may not be very moderate, and the drain for public moneys will probably rise past all calculation: and it is to be feared when America has consolidated its despotism, the world will witness the truth of the assertion–“that the pomp of an eastern monarch may impose on the vulgar who may estimate the force of a nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wise man, judges differently, it is by that very magnificence he estimates its weakness. He sees nothing more in the midst of this imposing pomp, where the tyrant sets enthroned, than a sumptuous and mournful decoration of the dead; the apparatus of a fastuous funeral, in the centre of which is a cold and lifeless lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power ready to disappear before the enemy, by whom it is despised!” 9. There is no provision for a rotation, nor any thing to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of the best abilities [281]from their share in the offices of government.–By this neglect we lose the advantages of that check to the overbearing insolence of office, which by rendering him ineligible at certain periods, keeps the mind of man in equilibrio, and teaches him the feelings of the governed, and better qualifies him to govern in his turn. 10. The inhabitants of the United States, are liable to be draged from the vicinity of their own county, or state, to answer to the litigious or unjust suit of an adversary, on the most distant borders of the Continent: in short the appelate jurisdiction of the Supreme Federal Court, includes an unwarrantable stretch of power over the liberty, life, and property of the subject, through the wide Continent of America. 11. One Representative to thirty thousand inhabitants is a very inadequate representation; and every man who is not lost to all sense of freedom to his country, must reprobate the idea of Congress altering by law, or on any pretence whatever, interfering with any regulations for the time, places, and manner of choosing our own Representatives. 12. If the sovereignty of America is designed to be elective, the circumscribing the votes to only ten electors in this State, and the same proportion in all the others, is nearly tantamount to the exclusion of the voice of the people in the choice of their first magistrate. It is vesting the choice solely in an aristocratic junto, who may easily combine in each State to place at the head of the Union the most convenient instrument for despotic sway. 13. A Senate chosen for six years will, in most instances, be an appointment for life, as the influence of such a body over the minds of the people will be coequal to the extensive powers with which they are vested, and they will not only forget, but be forgotten by their constituents–a branch of the Supreme Legislature thus set beyond all responsibility is totally repugnant to every principle of a free government. 14. There is no provision by a bill of rights to guard against the dangerous encroachments of power in too many instances to be named: but I cannot pass over in silence the insecurity in which we are left with regard to warrants unsupported by evidence–the daring experiment of granting writs of assistance in a former arbitrary administration is not yet forgotten in the Massachusetts;14 nor can we be so ungrateful to the memory of the patriots who counteracted their operation, as so soon after their manly exertions to save us from such a detestable instrument of arbitrary power, to subject ourselves to the insolence of any petty revenue officer to enter our houses, search, insult, and seize at pleasure. We are told by a gentleman of too much virtue and real probity to suspect he has a design to deceive–“that the whole constitution is a declaration of rights”–but mankind must think for themselves, and to many very judicious and discerning characters, the whole constitution with very few exceptions appears a perversion of the rights of particular states, and of private citizens.–But the [282]gentleman goes on to tell us, “that the primary object is the general government, and that the rights of individuals are only incidentally mentioned, and that there was a clear impropriety in being very particular about them.”15 But, asking pardon for dissenting from such respectable authority, who has been led into several mistakes, more from his prediliction in favour of certain modes of government, than from a want of understanding or veracity. The rights of individuals ought to be the primary object of all government, and cannot be too securely guarded by the most explicit declarations in their favor. This has been the opinion of the Hampdens, the Pyms, and many other illustrious names, that have stood forth in defence of English liberties; and even the Italian master in politicks, the subtle and renouned Machiavel acknowledges, that no republic ever yet stood on a stable foundation without satisfying the common people.16 15. The difficulty, if not impracticability, of exercising the equal and equitable powers of government by a single legislature over an extent of territory that reaches from the Missisippi to the Western lakes, and from them to the Atlantic ocean, is an insuperable objection to the adoption of the new system.–Mr. Hutchinson, the great champion for arbitrary power, in the multitude of his machinations to subvert the liberties of this country, was obliged to acknowledge in one of his letters, that, “from the extent of country from north to south, the scheme of one government was impracticable.”17 But if the authors of the present visionary project, can by the arts of deception, precipitation and address, obtain a majority of suffrages in the conventions of the states to try the hazardous experiment, they may then make the same inglorious boast with this insidious politician, who may perhaps be their model, that “the union of the colonies was pretty well broken, and that he hoped never to see it renewed.”18 16. It is an indisputed fact, that not one legislature in the United States had the most distant idea when they first appointed members for a convention, entirely commercial, or when they afterwards authorised them to consider on some amendments of the Federal union, that they would without any warrant from their constituents, presume on so bold and daring a stride, as ultimately to destroy the state governments, and offer a consolidated system, irreversible but on conditions that the smallest degree of penetration must discover to be impracticable. 17. The first appearance of the article which declares the ratification of nine states sufficient for the establishment of the new system, wears the face of dissention, is a subversion of the union of the Confederated States, and tends to the introduction of anarchy and civil convulsions, and may be a means of involving the whole country in blood. 18. The mode in which this constitution is recommended to the people to judge without either the advice of Congress, or the legislatures of the several states, is very reprehensible–it is an attempt to force it upon them [283]before it could be thoroughly understood, and may leave us in that situation, that in the first moments of slavery the minds of the people agitated by the remembrance of their lost liberties, will be like the sea in a tempest, that sweeps down every mound of security. But it is needless to enumerate other instances, in which the proposed constitution appears contradictory to the first principles which ought to govern mankind; and it is equally so to enquire into the motives that induced to so bold a step as the annihilation of the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen distinct states.–They are but too obvious through the whole progress of the business, from the first shutting up the doors of the federal convention and resolving that no member should correspond with gentlemen in the different states on the subject under discussion; till the trivial proposition of recommending a few amendments was artfully ushered into the convention of the Massachusetts. The questions that were then before that honorable assembly were profound and important, they were of such magnitude and extent, that the consequences may run parallel with the existence of the country; and to see them waved and hastily terminated by a measure too absurd to require a serious refutation, raises the honest indignation of every true lover of his country. Nor are they less grieved that the ill policy and arbitrary disposition of some of the sons of America has thus precipitated to the contemplation and discussion of questions that no one could rationally suppose would have been agitated among us, till time had blotted out the principles on which the late revolution was grounded; or till the last traits of the many political tracts, which defended the seperation from Britain, and the rights of men were consigned to everlasting oblivion. After the severe conflicts this country has suffered, it is presumed that they are disposed to make every reasonable sacrifice before the altar of peace.–But when we contemplate the nature of men and consider them originally on an equal footing, subject to the same feelings, stimulated by the same passions, and recollecting the struggles they have recently made, for the security of their civil rights; it cannot be expected that the inhabitants of the Massachusetts, can be easily lulled into a fatal security, by the declamatory effusions of gentlemen, who, contrary to the experience of all ages would perswade them there is no danger to be apprehended, from vesting discretionary powers in the hands of man, which he may, or may not abuse. The very suggestion, that we ought to trust to the precarious hope of amendments and redress, after we have voluntarily fixed the shackles on our own necks should have awakened to a double degree of caution.–This people have not forgotten the artful insinuations of a former Governor, when pleading the unlimited authority of parliament before the legislature of the Massachusetts; nor that his arguments were very similar to some lately urged by gentlemen who boast of opposing his measure, “with halters about their necks.”19 We were then told by him, in all the soft language of insinuation, that no form of government of human construction can be perfect–that we had [284]nothing to fear–that we had no reason to complain–that we had only to acquiesce in their illegal claims, and to submit to the requisitions of parliament, and doubtless the lenient hand of government would redress all grievances, and remove the oppressions of the people:20–Yet we soon saw armies of mercenaries encamped on our plains–our commerce ruined–our harbours blockaded–and our cities burnt. It may be replied, that this was in consequence of an obstinate defence of our privileges; this may be true; and when the “ultima ratio” is called to aid, the weakest must fall. But let the best informed historian produce an instance when bodies of men were intrusted with power, and the proper checks relinquished, if they were ever found destitute of ingenuity sufficient to furnish pretences to abuse it. And the people at large are already sensible, that the liberties which America has claimed, which reason has justified, and which have been so gloriously defended by the sword of the brave; are not about to fall before the tyranny of foreign conquest: it is native usurpation that is shaking the foundations of peace, and spreading the sable curtain of despotism over the United States. The banners of freedom were erected in the wilds of America by our ancestors, while the wolf prowled for his prey on the one hand, and more savage man on the other; they have been since rescued from the invading hand of foreign power, by the valor and blood of their posterity; and there was reason to hope they would continue for ages to illumine a quarter of the globe, by nature kindly seperated from the proud monarchies of Europe, and the infernal darkness of Asiatic slavery.–And it is to be feared we shall soon see this country rushing into the extremes of confusion and violence, in consequence of the proceedings of a set of gentlemen, who disregarding the purposes of their appointment, have assumed powers unauthorised by any commission, have unnecessarily rejected the confederation of the United States, and annihilated the sovereignty and independence of the individual governments.–The causes which have inspired a few men assembled for very different purposes with such a degree of temerity as to break with a single stroke the union of America, and disseminate the seeds of discord through the land may be easily investigated, when we survey the pa[r]tizans of monarchy in the state conventions, urging the adoption of a mode of government that militates with the former professions and exertions of this country, and with all ideas of republicanism, and the equal rights of men. Passion, prejudice, and error, are characteristics of human nature; and as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philosophy, religion, or good policy; to these shades in the human character must be attributed the mad zeal of some, to precipitate to a blind adoption of the measures of the late federal convention, without giving opportunity for better information to those who are misled by influence or ignorance into erroneous opinions.–Litterary talents may be prostituted, and the powers of genius debased to subserve the purposes of ambition, or avarice; but the feelings of [285]the heart will dictate the language of truth, and the simplicity of her accents will proclaim the infamy of those, who betray the rights of the people, under the specious, and popular pretence of justice, consolidation, and dignity. It is presumed the great body of the people unite in sentiment with the writer of these observations, who most devoutly prays that public credit may rear her declining head, and remunerative justice pervade the land; nor is there a doubt if a free government is continued, that time and industry will enable both the public and private debtor to liquidate their arrearages in the most equitable manner. They wish to see the Confederated States bound together by the most indissoluble union, but without renouncing their seperate sovereignties and independence, and becoming tributaries to a consolidated fabrick of aristocratick tyranny.–They wish to see government established, and peaceably holding the reins with honour, energy, and dignity; but they wish for no federal city whose “cloud cap’t towers”21 may screen the state culprit from the hand of justice; while its exclusive jurisdiction may protect the riot of armies encamped within its limits.–They deprecate discord and civil convulsions, but they are not yet generally prepared with the ungrateful Israelites to ask a King, nor are their spirits sufficiently broken to yield the best of their olive grounds to his servants, and to see their sons appointed to run before his chariots22–It has been observed by a zealous advocate for the new system, that most governments are the result of fraud or violence, and this with design to recommend its acceptance23–but has not almost every step towards its fabrication been fraudulent in the extreme? Did not the prohibition strictly enjoined by the general Convention, that no member should make any communication to his Constituents, or to gentlemen of consideration and abilities in the other States, bear evident marks of fraudulent designs?–This circumstance is regretted in strong terms by Mr. Martin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges “He had no idea that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of the States was contained in that Convention, and that he wished to have corresponded with gentlemen of eminent political characters abroad, and to give their sentiments due weight”–he adds, “so extremely solicitous were they, that their proceedings should not transpire, that the members were prohibited from taking copies of their resolutions, or extracts from the Journals, without express permission, by vote.”24–And the hurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people, without giving time, by adjournments, for better information, and more unanimity has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to resistance, as the only alternative between that and servitude, till in the confusion of discord, the reins should be seized by the violence of some enterprizing genius, that may sweep down the last barrier of liberty, it must be added to the score of criminality with which the fraudulent usurpation at Philadelphia, may be chargeable.–Heaven avert such a tremendous [286]scene! and let us still hope a more happy termination of the present ferment:–may the people be calm, and wait a legal redress; may the mad transport of some of our infatuated capitals subside; and every influential character through the States, make the most prudent exertions for a new general Convention, who may vest adequate powers in Congress, for all national purposes, without annihilating the individual governments, and drawing blood from every pore by taxes, impositions and illegal restrictions.–This step might again re-establish the Union, restore tranquility to the ruffled mind of the inhabitants, and save America from distresses, dreadful even in contemplation.–“The great art of governing is to lay aside all prejudices and attachments to particular opinions, classes or individual characters; to consult the spirit of the people; to give way to it; and in so doing, to give it a turn capable of inspiring those sentiments, which may induce them to relish a change, which an alteration of circumstances may hereafter make necessary.”–The education of the advocates for monarchy should have taught them, and their memory should have suggested that “monarchy is a species of government fit only for a people too much corrupted by luxury, avarice, and a passion for pleasure, to have any love for their country, and whose vices the fear of punishment alone is able to restrain; but by no means calculated for a nation that is poor, and at the same time tenacious of their liberty–animated with a disgust to tyranny–and inspired with the generous feelings of patriotism and liberty, and at the same time, like the ancient Spartans have been hardened by temperance and manly exertions, and equally despising the fatigues of the field, and the fear of enemies,”–and while they change their ground they should recollect, that Aristocracy is still a more formidable foe to public virtue, and the prosperity of a nation–that under such a government her patriots become mercenaries–her soldiers, cowards, and the people slaves.–Though several State Conventions have assented to, and ratified, yet the voice of the people appears at present strong against the adoption of the Constitution.–By the chicanery, intrigue, and false colouring of those who plume themselves, more on their education and abilities, than their political, patriotic, or private virtues–by the imbecility of some, and the duplicity of others, a majority of the Convention of Massachusetts have been flattered with the ideas of amendments, when it will be too late to complain–While several very worthy characters, too timid for their situation, magnified the hopeless alternative, between the dissolution of the bands of all government, and receiving the proffered system in toto, after long endeavouring to reconcile it to their consciences, swallowed the indigestible penacea, and in a kind of sudden desperation lent their signature to the dereliction of the honorable station they held in the Union, and have broken over the solemn compact, by which they were bound to support their own excellent constitution till the period of revision.–Yet Virginia, equally large and respectable, and who have done honour to themselves, by their vigorous [287]exertions from the first dawn of independence, have not yet acted upon the question; they have wisely taken time to consider before they introduce innovations of a most dangerous nature:–her inhabitants are brave, her burgesses are free, and they have a Governor who dares to think for himself, and to speak his opinion (without first pouring libations on the altar of popularity) though it should militate with some of the most accomplished and illustrious characters.25 Maryland, who has no local interest to lead her to adopt, will doubtless reject the system–I hope the same characters still live, and that the same spirit which dictated to them a wise and cautious care, against sudden revolutions in government, and made them the last State that acceded to the independence of America, will lead them to support what they so deliberately claimed.–Georgia apprehensive of a war with the Savages, has acceded in order to insure protection.–Pennsylvania has struggled through much in the same manner, as the Massachusetts, against the manly feelings, and the masterly reasonings of a very respectable part of the Convention:26 They have adopted the system, and seen some of its authors burnt in effigy–their towns thrown into riot27 and confusion, and the minds of the people agitated by apprehension and discord. New-Jersey and Delaware have united in the measure, from the locality of their situation, and the selfish motives which too generally govern mankind; the Federal City, and the seat of government, will naturally attract the intercourse of strangers–the youth of enterprize, and the wealth of the nation to the central States. Connecticut has pushed it through with the precipitation of her neighbour, with few dissentient voices;–but more from irritation and resentment to a sister State, perhaps partiality to herself in her commercial regulations, than from a comprehensive view of the system, as a regard to the welfare of all.28–But New-York has motives, that will undoubtedly lead her to a rejection, without being afraid to appeal to the understanding of mankind, to justify the grounds of their refusal to adopt a Constitution, that even the framers dare not risque to the hazard of revision, amendment, or reconsideration, least the whole superstructure should be demolished by more skilful and discreet architects.–I know not what part the Carolinas will take; but I hope their determinations will comport with the dignity and freedom of this country–their decisions will have great weight in the scale.–But equally important are the small States of New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island:–New-York, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and these two lesser States may yet support the liberties of the Continent; if they refuse a ratification, or postpone their proceedings till the spirits of the community have time to cool, there is little doubt but the wise measure of another federal convention will be adopted, when the members would have the advantage of viewing, at large, through the medium of truth, the objections that have been made from various quarters; such a measure [288]might be attended with the most salutary effects, and prevent the dread consequences of civil feuds.–But even if some of those large states should hastily accede, yet we have frequently seen in the story of revolution, relief spring from a quarter least expected. Though the virtues of a Cato could not save Rome, nor the abilities of a Padilla defend the citizens of Castile from falling under the yoke of Charles; yet a Tell once suddenly rose from a little obscure city, and boldly rescued the liberties of his country.–Every age has its Bruti and its Decii, as well as its Caesars and Sejani:–The happiness of mankind depends much on the modes of government, and the virtues of the governors; and America may yet produce characters who have genius and capacity sufficient to form the manners and correct the morals of the people, and virtue enough to lead their country to freedom. Since her dismemberment from the British empire, America has, in many instances, resembled the conduct of a restless, vigorous, luxurious youth, prematurely emancipated from the authority of a parent, but without the experience necessary to direct him to act with dignity or discretion. Thus we have seen her break the shackles of foreign dominion, and all the blessings of peace restored on the most honourable terms: She acquired the liberty of framing her own laws, choosing her own magistrates, and adopting manners and modes of government the most favourable to the freedom and happiness of society. But how little have we availed ourselves of these superior advantages: The glorious fabric of liberty successfully reared with so much labour and assiduity totters to the foundation, and may be blown away as the bubble of fancy by the rude breath of military combinations, and politicians of yesterday. It is true this country lately armed in opposition to regal despotism–impoverished by the expences of a long war, and unable immediately to fulfil their public or private engagements, have appeared in some instances, with a boldness of spirit that seemed to set at defiance all authority, government, or order, on the one hand; while on the other, there has been, not only a secret wish, but an open avowal of the necessity of drawing the reins of government much too taught, not only for republicanism, but for a wise and limited monarchy.–But the character of this people is not averse to a degree of subordination: the truth of this appears from the easy restoration of tranquility, after a dangerous insurrection in one of the states; this also evinces the little necessity of a complete revolution of government throughout the union. But it is a republican principle that the majority should rule; and if a spirit of moderation could be cultivated on both sides, till the voice of the people at large could be fairly heard it should be held sacred.–And if, on such a scrutiny, the proposed constitution should appear repugnant to their character and wishes; if they, in the language of a late elegant pen, should acknowledge that “no confusion in my mind, is more terrible to them than the stern disciplined regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary governments, where every heart is depraved [289]by fear, where mankind dare not assume their natural characters, where the free spirit must crouch to the slave in office, where genius must repress her effusions, or like the Egyptian worshippers, offer them in sacrifice to the calves in power, and where the human mind, always in shackles, shrinks from every generous effort.” Who would then have the effrontery to say, it ought not to be thrown out with indignation, however some respectable names have appeared to support it.–But if after all, on a dispassionate and fair discussion, the people generally give their voice for a voluntary dereliction of their privileges, let every individual who chooses the active scenes of life, strive to support the peace and unanimity of his country, though every other blessing may expire–And while the statesman is plodding for power, and the courtier practising the arts of dissimulation without check–while the rapacious are growing rich by oppression, and fortune throwing her gifts into the lap of fools, let the sublimer characters, the philosophic lovers of freedom who have wept over her exit, retire to the calm shades of contemplation, there they may look down with pity on the inconsistency of human nature, the revolutions of states, the rise of kingdoms, and the fall of empires.

Newspaper,No,Hampden (MA),,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/2/1788,"Mr. Russell, As I understand the fifth article in the proposed Constitution, it is provided by it, that when two thirds of the Senate, and two thirds of the House, (that is, as it appears to me, when two thirds of these bodies, seperately) shall deem it necessary, they shall propose amendments, or when the legislatures of two thirds of the States, shall apply for it, Congress is to call a Convention of all the States; this Convention when called, are not to be authorised to make amendments, but are only to propose them to the legislatures of the several States, and then if the legislatures of three fourth parts of the States shall agree to the amendments proposed, they are to be considered as a part of the Constitution.2 I am exceedingly pleased with this mode, so far as it regards the purpose which it was intended to effect. When a government is in exercise, all innovations are dangerous; the forming, or amending a government, opens a wide field for speculation, and men of genius and ability will throng it: One amendment begets another, and that a third, [842]until, perhaps, the parties are lost in the windings of their own arguments; and the people thrown into dreadful factions. Ideas like these have prevented, and do still prevent, the people in England, from attempting to regain an equal representation in Parliament. The exceeding slow, precarious, and expensive method for amendments, proposed in this Constitution, will prevent those frequent attempts which otherwise might create parties, to the great injury of the general government. But this remedy is by no means calculated for those defects, which appear upon the plan, before it is adopted. It is only intended for those which may appear upon the exercise of it. The United States are under great obligations to the honourable gentlemen who formed this plan; but in a country, where learning, ability, and particularly the knowledge of politicks, are so universally disseminated, it would be very extraordinary, if those men, however great and learned, should produce a system, in which no amendments, by others, should not be justly proposed. Yet if none could be proposed without introducing the confusion, which some people apprehend, we had, it may be said, better take it as it is. If there is no alternative but the ratifying this, or having no government, this position may be supported. But whether we had better adopt this as it is, or lay a foundation to obtain amendments before it is carried into exercise, is quite another question, and one which clearly exists. To ratify this, as it is, would be clearly deciding, that it is right, and a motion for immediate amendments would be preposterous: There are amendments, stated in my other paper, which are by no means local, and some of which, respecting the right of juries, I believe a majority of States will agree to.3 Mr. Wilson, has said that the Convention could agree upon no mode of expression to place this, as a constitutional right in the system.4 I see no objection to the mode of expression, I have used in my other paper. If there is not, this secures the right. But should not seven States, assembled in Convention, as proposed, agree to any amendments, the Constitution remains as it is—but should they agree to any, those will be a part of it."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,2/2/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, I am sensible it will be said the Constitution provides “that the electors in each State shall have the qualification requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.” But the new Constitution was evidently intended to, and must in its operation inevitably produce an abolition of the State governments, and when this is accomplished, the rule of apportionment of representatives according to property, must and will apply to electors, and have the effect mentioned. There would nevertheless be some consolation, if these were the only objections relative to representation in the new system, but in the second sect, of the first art. there is a provision that “no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty–five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United States,” &c. had tins provision extended to the foreigners, who under the government of the United States, had contended for the establishment of our independence, it would have met with no objection; but as it now stands, any foreigner having attained the age of twenty five years, having been seven years a citizen of the United States, and being an inhabitant of any State, may be elected a representative—and the right of being elected senators, is confirmed to foreigners who shall have attained “the age of thirty years,” and “who shall have been nine years a citizen of the United States, &c.” Thus are we to have a supreme legislature over us, to consist as well of foreigners, as of freemen of the United States.—CITIZENS OF AMERICA! What have you for a number of years been contending for? To what purpose have you expended so freely the blood and treasures of this country? To have a government with unlimited powers administered by foreigners? Will there not be immediately planted in the several States, men of abilities, who, having the appearance of privates, will nevertheless be in the pay of foreign powers? Will not such men ingratiate themselves into your favour, or, which will be much better for them, into the favour of the new government? And after seven years residence, will they not be in your federal house of representatives, or after nine years residence in your senate? Will not the most important secrets of your executive, respecting treaties and other matters, be by these means always open to European powers? Will you not be engaged in their trials? Will not your interest be sacrificed to their politicks? And will you not be the puppets of foreign Courts? Perhaps you will [844]be told that this provision will encourage emigrants, who will bring their money to America; but will you for such precarious and futile prospects consent to part with the right of governing yourselves? How carefully is this point guarded by Great–Britain. Judge Blackstone, book first, chap, tenth, says, “naturalization cannot be performed but by act of parliament, for by this an alien is put in exactly the same state as if he had been born in the king’s legiance, except only that he is incapable as well as a denizen of being a member of the privy council, or of parliament, no bill for naturalization can be received in either house of parliament without such disqualifying clause in it.”2 Other European powers are equally careful to exclude foreigners from their councils, whilst we, too wise to be benefited by the experience of governments which have existed for ages, and have attained the zenith of power, are adopting new principles, and exposing ourselves to evils which must inevitably lead us to destruction. What I before hinted respecting the danger of ratifying the new Constitution, as it stands, is now too evident to admit of a doubt: The opposition in Pennsylvania have been so imprudent as to burn in effigy, Judge M’Kean and Mr. Wilson, two of the leading members of their State Convention.3 The offenders are of obscure, and perhaps contemptible characters, and there is danger, that they will be arrested, without considering the probability of their having been excited to this outrage by men of influence—that the government will be opposed—and that a civil war will commence, which will flame through this continent, the consequences of which are to be dreaded: Thus will the fairest prospects that ever a people had of establishing for themselves good government, be at once blasted by imprudent zeal and cursed ambition. The virulent supporters of the new system, say, as those did in the parliament of Great–Britain, who pushed the American revenue–acts, that he opposition consists principally of men of low and vulgar minds, but the event will be much the same in the one case as in the other: The yeomenry supported by men of abilities and integrity in the several States, and standing on the ground of right, will maintain it; and in case of a war, will derive from this continent, many valuable men amongst us, who although now deceived by an aristocratick party, will be considered as usurpers and tyrants. These are not the apprehensions of a timid mind, they are predictions founded on our own experience, and God grant, that the wisdom of this Convention, on which is suspended the fate of America, may avert the impending evil. You have now the confidence of your countrymen, and it is hoped will not be deprived of it, by the arts of any individuals with interested views: You are now in [845]possession of an inestimable jewel, which if lost by a hasty ratification, will never be regained. It is not my wish to make any objections to the new system that are not well founded, and such I conceive to be those against biennial elections; For, considering the extent of the continent—the complicated business of the legislature—the experience requisite for its members—the necessity of their punctual attendance—and their arrangements for quitting their States, and familiar biennial elections, are not lengthy or dangerous; but can there be any reason, that in the first Congress, when the most important institutions and provisions will be made for carrying into effect the new system. Massachusetts, who according to her numbers of freemen, is entitled to nearly eleven out of sixty-five, should have but eight representatives? It must clearly appear, by my former numbers,4 that by the clause for regulating representation, we are to be reduced to the level of slaves, and that we shall soon be such, if the planters of the south are to send to the new Congress, representatives for three fifths of their negroes. But if this rule was even admissible, we are entitled to above nine representatives according to the present enumeration, and are told, as a consolation for having but eight members, that New-Hampshire has the deficient member, which to us is the same thing. This to me is unintelligible, for the members of both houses are to be paid out of the continental treasury, to which we shall contribute a full proportion according to our property: Why then should we give up to any State whatever, the important privilege of sending a representative? New-Hampshire is a good neighbour, but like other States, has her separate interests, and in pursuit of it, our’s may and will be sacrificed, by such an unreasonable concession. It is remarkable, that in the new system there is no qualification of property, for members of either branch of the federal legislature. It is surprizing to some gentlemen in Convention, that others should wish “to exclude from the federal government a good man, because he was not a rich one”5—No such thing is in contemplation, but on the other hand, they wish to send him there, and want to know what security there is, that a good man, not being wealthy, shall long continue to be eligible to such an office? If there was provision in the Constitution, that any citizen having three, six, or even nine hundred pounds estate, should be eligible, and that one of those sums should be requisite to qualify him, the publick would be equally guarded against a representation of persons having no property at all, and an exclusion of good men, because not wealthy: But the objection to the Constitution is, that it has no provision for securing the eligibility of good men. If good [846]members without much property, should oppose the wealthy but un-principled ones in Congress, and prevent their passing oppressive acts, such as revenue-acts, calculated to promote peculation—to protect defaulters—and to plunder the people, (as this system undoubtedly will of all their property) will not those unprincipled members exert themselves to pass an act, requiring for senators and representatives so high a qualification of property, as to exclude for ever from Congress, the good men who have not great estates? Surely they will, being fully authorized thereto by the omnipotent clause, enabling Congress “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers, vested by this Constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof.” This I call an omnipotent clause, for I must believe the man who says, that he can see in its aphelion, a comet which requires a century for its revolution, as soon as him that says, he can see the extent to which an artful and arbitrary legislature, can by this clause stretch their powers. We shall next consider the most important clause respecting representation, in art. 1st. sect. 4th. which provides, “that the times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof: But the Congress may at any time by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.”—Great ingenuity has been manifested in attempts to explain away the meaning and tendency of this fatal clause—a clause destructive of the small but best security which the people by the new system will have for preserving their liberties: Let us candidly attend to the arguments urged on this occasion. One is, that the legislatures, or as they are called the sovereignties of the States, are to be the constituents of the federal senate, and the people, the constituents of the house of representatives; that in the frequent struggles and contentions between these two branches to depress and control each other, each will be supported by its constituents, and therefore that the State legislatures, if uncontrouled by the federal legislature, would endeavour so to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections, as to deprive the people of their right of representation—Here, be sure, is the appearance of great tenderness for the rights of the people, and nothing but the appearance; for an imaginary danger of losing their rights is held up to them to introduce a remedy which must inevitably deprive them of those rights. That there will be such struggles and contentions between the two branches, is admitted—but is it natural to suppose, that the State legislatures, in aid of the federal senate, will wish to destroy the federal representation? Are not the members of one branch of the State legislatures in all the States [847]and of the other branch, in most of them, elected annually, or for a less time? Are not those members dependent on the people for reelections and equally with them affected by all federal and state laws? Can those members have any separate interest from the people for destroying the balance in the federal legislature? And if they could have such a separate interest, and should attempt to impair or destroy the right, of choosing federal representatives, would not the people instantly feel the injury, and leave out of the legislature men so inimical to their rights? was there no controuling power in the federal legislature for altering or regulating the times, plates, and manner of holding elections, would not the people, by annually electing those who are to make the regulations, have every check requisite for securing the right of elections? If, indeed, the members of the State legislatures held their offices independent of the people, and had separate interests, there would be some ground for the argument—but, dependent as they are, and having the same interests with the people, they cannot."
Newspaper,No,Bostonian,,American Herald,,2/4/1788,"Mr. Powars, While the hon. Convention are attending to amendments to the Constitution before them, it is presumable, they will not omit one which, in my opinion, will tend to the greatest security of the liberty of the people.—That an effectual barrier be made against the legislative & judicial departments being constituted in the same person—I say effectual. In doing which, it will become evidently necessary, that the gentlemen of the law, who are expounders thereof in the judiciary department should be excluded from a seat in the legislative.—I need not explain the evil tendency which an union ever had, and ever will have: It has been acknowledged, I believe, the greatest defects in the Massachusetts Constitution, and while 99 out of 100 of its inhabitants acknowledge the reasonableness of this proposition, no wonder those gentlemen are so extremely anxious for the present adoption of this Constitution, knowing, that should it go out to the people, that this security would be the first object of their attention, and that an adjournment would have this effect. But, say the ‘order,’1“shall we be divested of our privileges as citizens?”—Pray, why do not the Judges of the Judicial Court, the State Attorney, the Judges of Probate complain?2 Is it not evident, that if it is thought expedient to prohibit those characters from a seat in the legislature, gentlemen who have stated salaries, and therefore cannot be thought to have that local interest in view that may reasonably be supposed the other branch of the same court have, that they also should be debarred?—Is it not contradictory to every [851page icon]precept of human wisdom and inconsistent in its nature, that the expounders of law, men whose fortune and dependence depend principally on its inaccuracy, its vague and ambiguous terms, its incomprehensibleness, should be the framers thereof?—I say no wonder those gentlemen are for swallowing it down in its present form, while they naturally suppose they are conceived necessary agents in making laws to be the supreme law of the land, and at the same time harvesting in the judicial department.—Business enough to be sure, stepping from one court to the other, within the circuit of a court-yard, while almost every civil action of considerable magnitude between citizens of different states, besides a multiplicity of other trials are to pass thro’ their hands.—I say there are many alterations necessary to be made in the new Constitution before it will suit the people not only of Massachusetts but of New-England in general, but no one of so much consequence as the one proposed; for when the legislature of a nation are composed of men only, whose happiness depends on the simplicity and brevity as well as energy of the laws of their country, then may we expect to find a code suited to the genius of the people, and applicable to a republican government.—It. is inconsistent to suppose, that the same laws substituted to a monarchial, or aristocratical government, should be adequate to the simple and comprehensive constitution of a democracy—I cannot but wish the Constitution to be adopted, with amendments; but, inasmuch as I conceive this Convention has no authority or power to make any, they will prove futile in Congress with respect to a ratification, as Congress has not power to take cognizance of them by the proposed Constitution.—If the Constitution is good, and cannot be amended for the better, then no injury can happen by delay, as its advocates will naturally increase, and its opponents diminish."
Newspaper,No,Helvidius Priscus,,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/5/1788,"To the Inhabitants of Massachusetts. It has been one of the leading arts of the aristocratick faction, to depreciate the abilities of that part of the convention of the Massachusetts who are opposed to the arbitrary system, which the other supports with the avidity of interest, and the acrimony of contempt for those of less fortune, education, or other factitious advantages than themselves. An impartial observer, who has little personal acquaintance with, nor any undue prejudice against, the one side, or predilection in favour of the other, has read with great attention the speeches of both, on a subject the most important that has yet been discussed in America. He has been willing to discover truth, and ready to pay the tribute of applause wherever it is due, either to the peasant, just called from the field, or to the accomplished citizen, who has spent his life in a court; and has faithfully compared the arguments of both, and must acknowledge that, where he had been led to expect genius, improved by education, oratorical abilities, and profound reasoning, brightened by study and experience, he has been mortified, for the sake of human nature, to find evasion and sophistry; the prostration of the genuine principles of liberty, and the weak subterfuges of party, endeavouring to cast a veil over the design, the meaning and the consequences of a system that does not require the deepest sagacity to penetrate. On the other hand, there seems to be the modesty of benevolence and the boldness of truth, in the short, unadmired speeches which, in the garb of simplicity, utter the native dictates of good sense, uncorrupted by the splendour of wealth, and animated by the feelings of the man who revolts at the idea of relinquishing the privileges of the free-born citizen; and in the more lengthy investigations, a mr. K—sty2 appears to have as thorough a knowledge of the subject in debate, and to express his ideas of the police of the old and new system, as well as of the rights we possess, and the privileges we are about to relinquish, as some of the gentlemen of the bar, who claim more attention in the assembly, from their different modes of education. Nor will few deny that Dr. W l—d3 has discovered as much knowledge of ancient history, that he [859]speaks as clearly on the subject of intrigue, which has been the ruin of republicks, and that he elucidates the consequence of different governments and combinations, at least with as much precision as mr. G—m,4 without introducing the localities, that occasion a temporary animosity between Connecticut and New–York.5 The comprehensive view of the subject of taxation, the inconsistency of opinion in those who were lately perhaps over delicate with regard to a general impost, yet are now ready to make the most unequivocal surrender of all their property at the call of a Congress without check or controul—the fatal tendency and the aggregate evils that must be the certain consequence of such an imprudent resignation of the purse and the sword—the anticipated view of the miseries introduced in the venerable garb of ancestorial sanction,6 and the short survey of the complicated mischiefs with which the whole system is replete, are delineated with a patriotick zeal and energy of expression, and in an unaffected style and manner, that does honour to the abilities, as well as to the heart, of mr. Symms. But a comparative view of abilities or address, of the justice and rationality of one cause, or of the absurdities and consequential confusions of the other, are of little avail—The temporizing expedient may probably be adopted: then may your friends in both countries pity the total debilitation of that energetick spirit that has made you the admiration of the speculative man of science in his closet, and has gained you the alliance of some of first nations in Europe; while your enemies will justly ridicule your wanton waste of blood for the bubble of liberty, which you have suffered to be blown away by the breath of those who never inhaled the smallest breezes from the temple of freedom; and your oppressors will laugh that the gilded trap has caught the gudgeons in its net. And when the thin vizard that has been cast before your injured opticks shall fail from your lids, you may find the men, who have lured you to the snare, are the least disposed to meliorate your sufferings. But it is said, you must accept and ratify the proposed constitution—Then, with your hands tied behind you, and sackcloth on your backs, you may perhaps be permitted to approach the federal city with supplicatory addresses, to mollify the hard conditions of your subjugation; and among other evils you deplore, you may pray that no direct taxes may be assessed, but when the exigences of your masters require it. But you will remember the Caudine Forks cannot be repassed, without bending the neck beneath the yoke of the Samnites;7 you may then, as the humiliated Romans, in the deepest consternation, look with silent agony on each other, but without discovering a ray of hope in the countenance of the brave, reduced by their own rashness to [860]inextricable wretchedness: nor will you forget that you have been repeatedly warned of your danger by the friendly pen of HELVIDIUS PRISCUS."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/5/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, In my last address1 I ascertained, from historical records, the following principles, that, in the original state of government, the whole power resides in the whole body of the nation; that when a people appoint certain persons to govern them, they delegate their whole power; that a constitution is not itself a bill of rights; and that, whatever is the form of government, a bill of rights is essential to the security of the persons and property of the people. It is an idea favourable to the interest of mankind at large, that government is founded in compact. Several instances may be produced of it; but none is more remarkable than our own. In general I have chosen to apply to such facts as are in the reach of my readers. For this purpose I have chiefly confined myself to examples drawn from the history of our own country, and to the old testament. It is in the power of every reader to verify examples thus substantiated. Even in the remarkable argument on the fourth section, relative to the power over election, I was far from stating the worst of it, as it respects the adverse party. A gentleman, respectable in many points, but more especially for his systematick and perspicuous reasoning in his profession, has repeatedly stated to the Convention among his reasons in favour of that section, that the Rhode-Island assembly have for a considerable time past had a bill lying on their table for altering the manner of elections for representatives in that state.2 He has stated it with all the zeal of a person, who believed his argument to be a good one. But surely a bill lying on a table can never be considered as any more than an intention to pass it, and nobody pretends that it ever actually did pass. It is in strictness only the intention of a part of the assembly, for nobody can aver that it ever will pass.(a) I write not with an intention to deceive, but that the whole argument may be stated fairly. Much eloquence and ingenuity have been employed in shewing that side of the argument in favour of the proposed constitution; but it ought to be considered, that if we accept it upon mere verbal explanations, we shall find ourselves deceived. I appeal to the knowledge of every one, if it does not frequently happen, that a law is interpreted in practice very differently from the intention of the legislature. Hence arises the necessity of acts to amend and explain former acts. This is [864]not in inconvenience in the common and ordinary business of legislation; but is a great one in a constitution. A constitution is a legislative act of the whole people. It is an excellence that it should be permanent, otherwise we are exposed to perpetual insecurity from the fluctuation of government. We should be in the same situation as under absolute government, sometimes exposed to the pressure of greater, and sometimes unprotected by the weaker power in the sovereign. It is now generally understood, that it is for the security of the people, that the powers of the government should be lodged in different branches. By this means publick business will go on, when they all agree, and stop when they disagree. The advantage of checks in government is thus manifested, where the concurrence of different branches is necessary to the same act; but the advantage of a division of business is advantageous in other respects. As in every extensive empire, local laws are necessary to suit the different interests, no single legislature is adequate to the business. All human capacities are limitted to a narrow space; and as no individual is capable of practising a great variety of trades no single legislature is capable of managing all the variety of national and state concerns. Even if a legislature was capable of it, the business of the judicial department must, from the same cause, be slovenly done. Hence arises the necessity of a division of the business into national and local. Each department ought to have all the powers necessary for executing its own business, under such limitations as tend to secure us from any inequality in the operations of government. I know it is often asked against whom in a government by representation is a bill of rights to secure us? I answer, that such a government is indeed a government by ourselves; but as a just government protects all alike, it is necessary that the sober and industrious part of the community should be defended from the rapacity and violence of the vicious and idle. A bill of rights therefore ought to set forth the purposes for which the compact is made, and serves to secure the minority against the usurpation and tyranny of the majority. It is a just observation of his excellency doctor Adams in his learned defence of the American constitutions, that unbridled passions produce the same effect whether in a king, nobility, or a mob.3 The experience of all mankind has proved the prevalence of a disposition to use power wantonly. It is therefore as necessary to defend an individual against the majority in a republick, as against the king in a monarchy. Our state constitution has wisely guarded this point. The present confederation has also done it. I confess that I have yet seen no sufficient reason for not amending the confederation, though I have weighed the argument with candour. I think it would be much easier to amend it than the new constitution. [865]But this is a point on which men of very respectable character differ. There is another point in which nearly all agree, and that is, that the new constitution would be better in many respects if it had been differently framed. Here the question is not so much what the amendments ought to be, as in what manner they shall be made; whether they shall be made as conditions of our accepting the constitution, or whether we shall first accept it, and then try to amend it. I can hardly conceive that it should seriously be made a question. If the first question, whether we will receive it as it stands, be negatived, as it undoubtedly ought to be, while the conviction remains that amendments are necessary; the next question will be, what amendments shall be made? Here permit an individual, who glories in being a citizen of Massachusetts, and who is anxious that the character may remain undiminished. to propose such articles as appear to him necessary for preserving the rights of the state. He means not to retract any thing with regard to the expediency of amending the old confederation, and rejecting the new one totally; but only to make a proposition which he thinks comprehends the general idea of all parties. If the new constitution means no more than the friends of it acknowledge, they certainly can have no objection to affixing a declaration in favour of the rights of states and of citizens, especially as a majority of the states have not yet voted upon it.— “Resolved, that the constitution lately proposed for the United States be received only upon the following conditions: “1. Congress shall have no power to alter the time, place or manner of elections, nor any authority over elections, otherwise than by fining such state as shall neglect to send its representatives or senators, a sum not exceeding the expense of supporting its representatives or senators one year. “2. Congress shall not have the power of regulating the intercourse between the states, nor to levy any direct tax on polls or estates, nor any excise. “3. Congress shall not have power to try causes between a state and citizens of another state, nor between citizens of different states; nor to make any laws relative to the transfer of property between those parties, nor any other matter which shall originate in the body of any state. “4. It shall be left to every state to make and execute its own laws, except laws impairing contracts, which shall not be made at all. “5. Congress shall not incorporate any trading companies, nor alienate the territory of any state. And no treaty, ordinance or law of the United States shall be valid for these purposes. “6. Each state shall have the command of its own militia. “7. No continental army shall come within the limits of any state, other than garrison to guard the publick stores, without the consent of such states in time of peace. “8. The president shall be chosen annually and shall serve but one year, and shall be chosen successively from the different states, changing every year. “9. The judicial department shall be confined to cases in which ambassadours are concerned, to cases depending upon treaties, to offences committed upon the high seas, to the capture of prizes, and to cases in which a foreigner residing in some foreign country shall be a party and an American state or citizen shall be the other party; provider no suit shall be brought upon a state note. “10. Every state may emit bills of credit without making them a tender, and may coin money, of silver, gold or copper, according to the continental standard. “11. No powers shall be exercised by Congress or the president but such as are expressly given by this constitution and not excepted against by this declaration. And any office[r]s of the United States offending against an individual state shall be held accountable to such state as any other citizen would be. “12. No officer of Congress shall be free from arrest for debt by authority of the state in which the debt shall be due. “13. Nothing in this constitution shall deprive a citizen of any state of the benefit of the bill of rights established by the constitution of the state in which he shall reside, and such bills of rights shall be considered as valid in any court of the United States where they shall be pleased. “14. In all those causes which are triable before the continental courts, the trial by jury shall be held sacred.’ These at present, appear to me the most important points to be guarded. I have mentioned a reservation of excise to the separate states, because it is necessary, that they should have some way to discharge their own debts, and because it is placing them in an humiliating & disgraceful situation to depute them to transact the business of internal government without the means to carry it on. It is necessary also, as a check on the national government, for it has hardly been known that any government having the powers of war, peace, and revenue, has failed to engage in needless and wanton expense. A reservation of this kind is therefore necessary to preserve the importance of the state governments; without this the extremes of the empire will in a very short time sink into the same degradation and contempt with respect to the middle state[s] as Ireland, Scotland, & Wales, are in with regard [867]to England. All the men of genius and wealth will resort to the seat of government, that will be [the] center of revenue, and of business, which the extremes will be drained to supply. This is not mere vision, it is justified by the whole course of things. We shall therefore, if we neglect the present opportunity to secure ourselves, only encrease the number of proofs, already too many, that mankind are incapable of enjoying their liberty. I have been the more particular in stating the amendments to be made, because many gentlemen think it would be preferrable to receive the new system with corrections. I have by this means brought the corrections into one view, and shewn several of the principal points in which it is unguarded. As it is agreed, at least professedly, on all sides, that those rights should be guarded, it is among the inferiour questions in what manner it is done, provided it is absolutely and effectually done. For my own part, I am fully of opinion, that it would be best to reject this plan, and pass an explicit resolve, defining the powers of Congress to regulate the intercourse between us and foreign nations, under such restrictions as shall render their regulations equal in all parts of the empire. The impost, if well collected, would be fully equal to the interest of the foreign debt, and the current charges of the national government. It is evidently for our interest that the charges should be as small as possible. It is also for our interest that the western lands should, as fast as possible, be applied to the purpose of paying the home debt. Internal taxation and that fund have already paid two thirds of the whole debt, notwithstanding the embarrassments usual at the end of a war. We are now rising fast above our difficulties, every thing at home has the appearance of improvement, government is well established, manufactures increasing rapidly, and trade expanding. Till since the peace we never sent a ship to India, and the present year, it is said, sends above a dozen vessels from this state only, to the countries round the Indian ocean. Vast quantities of our’ produce are exported to those countries. It has been so much the practice of European nations to farm out this branch of trade, that we ought to be exceedingly jealous of our right. The manufactures of the state probably exceed in value one million pounds, for the last year. Most of the useful and some ornamental fabricks are established. There is great danger of these improvements being injured unless we practice extreme caution at setting out. It will always be for the interest of the southern states to raise a revenue from the more commercial ones. It is said that the consumer pays it; But does not a commercial state consume more foreign goods than a landed one? The people are more crouded, and of consequence the land is less able to support them. We know it is to be a favourite [868]system to raise the money where it is. But the money is to be expended at another place, and is therefore so much withdrawn annually from our stock. This is a single instance of the difference of interest; it would be very easy to produce others. Innumerable as the differences of manners, and these produce differences in the laws. Uniformity in legislation is of no more importance than in religion; Yet the framers of this new constitution did not even think it necessary that the president should believe, that there is a God, although they require an oath of him. It would be easy to shew the propriety of a general declaration upon that subject. But this paper is already extended too far. Another reason which I had in stating the amendments to be made, was to shew how nearly those who are for admitting the system with the necessary alterations, agree with those who are for rejecting this system and amending the confederation. In point of convenience, the confederation amended would be infinitely preferable to the proposed constitution. In amending the former, we know the powers granted, and are subject to no perplexity; but in reforming the latter, the business is excessively intricate, and great part of the checks on Congress are lost. It is to be remembered too, that if you are so far charmed with eloquence, and misled by fair representations and charitable constructions, as to adopt an undefined system, there will be no saying afterwards that you were mistaken, and wish to correct it. It will then be the constitution of our country, and entitled to defence. If Congress should chuse to avail themselves of a popular commotion to continue in being, as the fourth section justifies, and as the British parliament has repeatedly done the only answer will be, that it is the constitution of our country, and the people chose it. It is therefore necessary to be exceedingly critical. Whatsoever way shall be chosen to secure our rights, the same resolve ought to contain the whole system of amendment. If it is rejected, the resolve should contain the amendations of the old system; and accepted, it should contain the corrections of the new one. (a)A writer in the Gazette of 29th Jan. under the signature of captain M’Daniel having with civility and apparent candour, called for an explanation of what was said in one of my former papers, I have chosen to mention him with respect, as the only one of my reviewers who deserves an answer.4"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,2/6/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, Let us, however, suppose the federal senate, in such a mighty squabble calling on their constituents, the State legislatures, for aid to impair or destroy the democratical federal branch. Is it possible that the members of any State senate or house, would “introduce such regulations, as would render the right of the people, insecure,” or “make an unequal and partial division of the State into districts,” or “disqualify one third of the electors,” as has been urged? Would the members from Worchester, or Hampshire, in either branch consent to regulations which would deprive their constituents of their suffrages and increase the privileges of the electors of Suffolk, or any other county? Could the members in either branch of the State legislature, ever have a motive to adopt such measures, as would deprive themselves as well as their constituents from influencing the elections of federal representatives? Will not the members of the State legislatures, as part of the collective body, be the constituents of the [870]federal representatives? Will not the State legislatures, being thus the constituents of both branches, be the only safe and proper umpire for preserving the harmony and ballance of the federal legislature? Will not the State legislatures knowing there can be no security for property under a rapacious aristocracy, leave out of the federal senate every member that shall aim at an undue controul of the house, and endeavour to produce by the people the same change of such federal representatives, as shall encroach on the rights of the senate? Surely they would; and is unnatural to suppose that the State legislatures can have any interest in aiding the federal senate to destroy the ballance of the federal legislature, or if they had, that the measure would be attempted; or if it was, that the people would need any other assistance, than their rights, under the State Constitutions to defeat the attempt. But let us suppose there is some danger of this evil, is it to be avoided by incur[r]ing one much greater? The federal senators, except two thirds of the first senate, will be always elected for six and the house for two years The members of both the federal branches from the duration and respectability of their appointments, and from their lucrative establishments, to be made by themselves, will have a great interest in their offices, and every motive to perpetuate them. This will be a common interest, and may, (as I think will evidently appear) be attained without even altering the form of the new Constitution, so excellently well adapted is it, to the establishment, of a baleful aristocracy. The federal legislature may, as has been shewn, and undoubtedly will, make the qualification of property so high, as that few in each State can be elected to either the senate or house: Whilst the revenue laws and other civil establishments in the executive and judicial departments of the union, will necessarily produce through the Continent, swarms of officers, who being nominated by the President, and appointed by and with the advice and consent of the senate, will be in their interest, and in the interest of the house likewise, as grants will be made by their joint concurrence. All the federal military officers will be appointed in the same manner, and be in the same interest—all the militia officers, through the continent, where appointment are by the new system, reserved to the States, will nevertheless, as the military officers under the present Confederation, be commissioned by the President of the United States, and attached to the congressional interest. All the late officers of the army who are a very reputable and influential body of men, and who are united by an institution, which gives them ten times the influence, they would otherwise have, will have the same attachment to federal government. How easy then, will it be with such support, for a body of such able men as [871]will compose Congress, to establish the elections of federal representatives at the metropolis as at any other place, in each state, and when this is effected, to collect the congressional or crown officers (as they soon will be called) at that place, and carry the elections for these senators and representatives who shall be in the aristocratical interest of the federal government, leaving out all honest republicans, who shall have been so vulgar as to have paid any regard to the interest of their constituents?"
Newspaper,No,Adelos,,Hampshire Gazette,,2/6/1788,"Mr. Printer, In the present political contest, respecting the establishment of the Federal Constitution, I have been rather a silent spectator—I have heard and read much—said little—The writers on both sides the question, have shewn spirit and learning. I confess the advocates for it have manifested a spirit (some of them at least) rather unbecoming, and somewhat bordering upon persecution: this I hope, however, will not be justified by people in general; but that every one may be allowed to speak his sentiments, and have fair play at disquisition. It is a matter of importance and requires sobriety. In this view of the matter, I beg leave to offer a few remarks for public consideration. [872]I am not about at this time to impugn every part and parcel of the new frame of government; but if I may be allowed the natural, inherent, the grand birthright of all the human race, I will very freely and boldly oppose one article of it,—page 12, beginning of section 9.1 which however strange it may appear, has been but little noticed. It permits, in express terms, of that most cursed of all trades, the African slave-trade. I must confess it will be very wonderful to me, if the Massachusettensians (above all people in [the] world) should hold up their hands to give efficacy to a constitution which admits of slavery; and not only so, but Congress is expressly restricted from making any provision against it, for the term of twenty-one years, let the mischiefs resulting there-from be ever so great. It is strange, I say, if Massachusetts should give countenance to this, after establishing a constitution of their own, fronted with these words, “All men are born free and equal;”2 and in consequence of which have emancipated many wretched Africans, and delivered them from masters more sordid to them (many of them) than they were to the brutal herd. I cannot see but the first moment we adopt the Federal Constitution as it stands, we rase [i.e., raze] our own to the very foundation. We allow that freedom and equity are the natural rights of every man born into the world; but if we vote this, we vote to take away those rights, and to sport ourselves with the liberties of mankind. I wish to know how one man came by his right to the service of another, without his free consent, and a proper recompense when required? Whether we go ourselves to Africa to procure slaves, or employ others to do it for us, or purchase them at any rate of others, it matters not a whit. It is an old saying and a true one, “The partaker is as sad as the thief.” It is well known that this trade is carried on by violence and rapine; nay, murder is not, I presume, out of the question. Who gave mankind a right thus to play the devil with one another? We reprobate the conduct of the Algerines; their conduct truly is highly reprehensible;—they enslave the Americans,3—the Americans enslave the Africans: which is worst? Six of one and half a dozen of the other. Congress may make laws to punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas; but yet we may go to Africa, and lay waste and destroy what we please; captivate thousands of free born men, without the least provocation—bring them to America and doom them to perpetual bondage, and all with impunity: Congress are not to be allowed to prevent it. The thought is truly shocking, and nature shudders at the recollection! Flimsy indeed, is the argument of the Connecticut Landholder, in support of the Constitution, that “slaves are so numerous in the southern states, should an emancipation take place, they will be undone,”—truly [873]wretched enough!4 So then, if by fraud and violence, I have got the possession of my neighbour’s estate, reduced him to misery and slavery, the laws may not restore it to him, the rightful owner again, lest I should be undone. Too weak even for idiotcy itself. I think upon the whole the article ought to be expunged; or that we ought not to vote to give life to a constitution, which at its first breath will be branded with eternal infamy, by having a stamp of slavery and oppression upon it."
Letter,Yes,Silas Lee,George Thatcher,,,2/7/1788,"My Dear Uncle … In my last I gave you a small sketch of the sentiments of the people in these Counties, respecting the new Constitution—as I have never interested myself much in the matter, I could not be very particular s to that—I also suggested a few doubts respecting, perhaps you will call them objections against, the plan—I think the fourth Sect: grants, a dangerous power—& a power too by no means necessary to the establishment of an energetick Government—If the clause was conditional it would serve every purpose, but a destruction of the State legislatures—the powers of the Senate are greater, if I mistake not than the Lord’ of England—have they a power to propose amendments to Money Bills?—A Republican Government is gaurenteed to each State in the Union—But may not Congress establish one republican form, such is they shall chuse, throughout the whole?—also why is it a compact of Individuals, instead of a Confederacy of States? the former suppose one consolidated Government, the latter only a combination of several independent sovereignties for particular national purposes.

Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle,,2/7/1788,"Doth he not speak Parables?       Ezekiel.2 A certain Farmer not long ago, settled on a new piece of land, which he was in hopes, by his industry and the assistance of his healthy boys, to be able to cultivate to advantage. Unfortunately he was of a morose, tyrannical and selfish disposition; and often irritated his boys, by his austerity; and as they grew older, he used them more like slaves than children. They being hardy, resolute, and not easily subjected to rigorous government, and finding that their father was not their natural parent, but only a father in-law;3 and also that he had not so good a title to the farm, as they would have when they came of age, determined with one consent, that if he persisted in his tyranical conduct, they would attempt to oust him and set up for themselves. Accordingly, on a certain day, when the choleric old gentleman, had begun to enforce [877]his unreasonable commands with a cudgel, they manfully returned the blow, and after an obstinate struggle, he was forced to retreat; and with a broken pate, and sore sides, he betook himself muttering and resentful, to his paternal estate on the other side of the water. The lads, being Thirteen in number, and of a sanguine, vigorous and enterprizing turn, concluded they could easily manage their joint interest so as very soon to make their fortunes. They had sense enough to know, that as their united efforts had ejected their father in-law, so their united affections and efforts would be necessary for their future establishment and prosperity. They had only a small cultivated spot on their new farm, upon which they had a crop of wheat, of which they had selected for seed, a choice sheaf apiece, larger or smaller in proportion to the age, ability and industry of each brother. As they had no shelter for the preservation of their grain, it was judged necessary that all their sheaves should be compacted together into one shock. But the difficulty was how to compact them so as that the whole should be secure from injury and depredation. At length, with joint contrivance and industry, they formed a kind of covering with straw and other materials, which they placed over their sheaves to keep them together, and to screen them from storms and from birds of prey. But it was soon found to be inadequate to the purpose. So weak and loose was it in its contexture, that it could neither shelter the sheaves from the weather, nor keep them from falling apart. Nay, it evidently sunk down, so that most of the sheaves stuck out above it; and by unnatural pressure against one another, they began to be intertangled, to lose their fine shape and proportion, and threatened the bursting their bands and becoming like a heap of threshed straw. So that the brothers were all convinced that something more effectual must be done, or all their past labour, and fine prospects of future crops, would be lost; and their grain, appearing like a neglected, broken shock, and free plunder for all, should be pillaged away, not only by birds and beasts of prey, but by rapacious farmers around them. But though the case appeared urgent, it was difficult to find out, or to agree among themselves, what was best to be done. There was a growing uneasiness and anxiety; and especially as blackbirds and vermin had begun to make disorder and waste in many of the sheaves,—some thought it was best for each one to take care of his own bundle separately. Some, through want of spirit and a fraternal affection and generosity, seemed not to care whether any thing was done for mutual advantage. And some were so abject and base, as to wish to go back again to their step father, and ask his pardon, and promise to submit to all his orders and impositions for the future, if he would take their bundles into his custody. But the most of them [878]having cherished their original independent and generous spirit, and being fully persuaded that they had wit and ability enough among themselves, if they would but unitedly exert it, to preserve their own sheaves, without meanly sueing to others for assistance, manfully determined to lay their heads and their hands together, and shew what they could do. Accordingly all but one or two entered into close consultation to strike out some plan for the joint security of their precious grain The youngest Boy, indeed, having been neglected in his education, and kept low company, was ignorant, wilful and knavish; and ungenerously refused to join with his brothers in any well judg’d, interesting expedient.4 But this discouraged not the rest. The most active and penetrating among them at length devised the following as the most probable scheme to answer the purpose, viz. That a handful of the tallest, strongest and straitest of the straws, should be culled out of each bundle, the bigness of the handfuls to be determined by the bigness of their respective bundles; and that these handfuls so selected should by proper interwoven threads and constricting bands, be ingeniously formed into a Cap-Sheaf to unite and cover the whole. Every one saw that this, if faithfully executed, was a judicious expedient; that thirteen sheaves well bound, and set close and upright under such a Cap-Sheaf, would help to keep one another up; and would remain safe and well shaped, uninjured by storms, and undiminished by birds of prey; and moreover would comprize and convey the ideas of unity, security and comely proportion. And that no apprehensions, jealousies, or dissensions might be entertained amongst these brothers, it was provided that each one should have the culling of his own bundle for the forming and repairing the Cap-Sheaf, and might aid with his own ingenuity in the construction of it. But tho’ common sense could not but acknowledge this; and also, that it was much better to spare a handful of grain for the preservation of the rest, than to risk the loss of the whole for want of such a sheaf, yet several were fearful, and some were obstinate Some pretended they had as good run the venture of losing all at once, as to have all the best of it pick’d away by little and little. Some feared the Cap-Sheaf would be made so heavy as to settle their sheaves flat to the ground. Others pretended that the Cap-Sheaf being compose of the tallest and strongest of the straws, might be made so stiff and tight, as to compress and pinch the heads of their sheaves too close; or at least, might enclose them so effectually, as to prevent their inspecting and handling them, or taking them out, whenever they should think fit. In short, notwithstanding the union of interest, honor and safety that demanded the united sentiments, exertions and affections of these thirteen brethren, divers of them objected to the proposed [879]measure. So that they who had the most extended views, and felt the warmest emotions of brotherly kindness as well as of self love, dreaded the consequences of disunion.—The subject had been so long in debate, and was so interesting to this rising family, that it engaged the attention of older farmers though at a distance. Those among them who had a sense of honor and humanity, were grieved at the dissentions of these brethren, and wished they might have wisdom to coalesce, and preserve their precious seed, upon which all their hopes of a succession of encreasing harvests depended. Others that were selfish and unfriendly, endeavoured to blow the coals of strife between these brothers, in hopes they would be obliged to seperate one from another, and become tenants upon their farms, or servants in their families. And particularly their old step father listened with milignant pleasure to every account that was brought him of their quarrels and dangers, and hoped soon to see the time when he should get these rebellious Jacks into his hands again, when he would keep their noses effectually to the grindstone, and make them repent their audacity in resisting his authority. In fine, the most sanguine hopes, that the most benevolent of these brothers, or of their friends, dared to entertain, were, that nine of them would pretty soon be induced to secure their sheaves in the method proposed, and that the rest would see cause after a while to follow their example; except the youngest; and he, they expected, would become a vagabond and a highway-robber, and soon be brought to an inglorious end; and that if any of the scattered straws of his sheaf remained, worth picking up, they would be collected, and tuck’d into some of the other bundles."
Newspaper,No,A Watchman,,Worcester Magazine,,2/7/1788,"For the WORCESTER MAGAZINE. To the CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES. Men, Brethren, and Sisters, Hearken! it is now a critical time with us, and a time in which we ought to be upon our watch, and upon our guard. Now is the time for us to look out; now is the time for us to take care; now is the time for us to see that nothing is done to deprive us of our religious, or our civil liberties. Our government at present is democratical, that is, the power is in the people; we are allowed to choose our rulers, make our own laws, and perform religious worship according to the dictates of our own consciences; and by our constitution a freedom of speech, and the liberty of the press, are allowed to every one of us. But although we are under such an excellent constitution, behold a new one is presented to us for our reception, which appears much like an aristocratical from; and will, if it is established, demolish a part of our democratical government, and deprive us of a part of our liberties. Before we suffer this new constitution to be established, we ought to consider seriously what it contains, and whether it is calculated to promote our felicity? or whether, like a wolfe in sheep’s clothing, it is calculated to vest certain men with more power, deprive us of our liberties, and bring our land into lordships, and lead us into vassalage and slavery, like the poor people in Holland, who, after they had obtained their independency, lost their power, and were not suffered to have any voice in their government, no not so much as to choose their representatives. How often has it been ringing in our ears from every quarter of the United States, that our present constitution is the best that ever was or ever could be established; if that be true, pray what need is there of an alternation—what need have we to alter a constitution that is every way perfect; if we should suffer our democratical government to be demolished, and an aristocratical one established, it is probable that in a few years some designing men will attempt to pull that down, and set up one that is monarchical, and so bring the country under a military government. Permit me then, my beloved brethren and sisters, to point out wherein this new constitution is deficient. 1st. There is no bill of rights in it. 2d. Although different religions are allowed to set in Congress, yet there is no liberty given to the people to perform religious worship according to the dictates of their consciences. 3d. There is a door opened for the Jews, Turks, and Heathen [881]to enter into publick office, and be seated at the head of the government of the United States. 4th. There is nothing said about the people being allowed the freedom of speech and the liberty of the press. 5th. It divides Congress into three branches, as President. Senate, and a house of Representatives, which will be a great clog to business, and a hindrance to the making of laws with expedition and dispatch, 6th. It deprives men that are endowed with the wisdom that is from above, from entering into Congress; unless they have arrived at a certain age, and have abode in the states a certain quantity of time. 7th. It augments the members of Congress, and makes the government more expensive. 8th. It deprives the people of the liberty of choosing their delegates to Congress annually, and of recalling them when they please. 9th. It almost annihilates the state governments, and deprives their legislature of the power of making their own laws. 10th. It makes no provision against the keeping a standing army in a time of peace. 11th. It deprives the people of the power of levying and collecting their own taxes. 12th. It vests Congress with power to tax all the states, to send forth collectors, and enforce the payment of taxes by a standing army. 13th. It vests Congress with power to run the people into debt, by borrowing money of foreign nations, upon the credit of the United States; and it doth not oblige the members of that assembly to render any account of the expenditure of the same, if they shall see fit to secret it. 14th. No provision is made in it against having the civil power subject to the military, nor against having people that do not belong to an army or navy tried and punished by the military laws. 15th. It deprives the people in the several states of the liberty of making their own constitution, and vests it in the hands of Congress. 16th. It deprives the inhabitants of each state of the power of choosing their superiour and inferiour judges. Thus have I exhibited some of the deficiencies in our new Constitution, perhaps more might be mentioned; but although there are some deficiencies, yet there are many excellent things that are worthy of our reception and establishment, providing our constitution is deficient. Some people are averse to a democratical government, because they esteem it to be the most expensive and irregular; but the governments of Connecticut and Rhodeisland have been such from their first settlement: they have chose their own officers, and made and executed their own laws, and where can we find cheaper and more regular governments than they have been? Thus, my beloved friends, have I given you the foregoing hints, that you may be upon your guard, and ward off the impending danger. Keep the power in your own hands, and let nothing be established that may deprive you of your liberties and make you unhappy."
Diary,Yes,John Quincy Adams,,,,2/7/1788,"This day at about noon, the news arrived in this Town, that the federal Constitution, was yesterday, adopted and ratified by a majority of nineteen members in our State convention.—In this Town the Satisfaction is almost universal: for my own part, I have not been pleased with this System, and my acquaintance, have long since branded me with the name of an antifederalist. But I am now converted, though not convinced, my feelings upon the occasion have not been passionate nor violent, and as upon the decision of this question I find myself on the weaker side, I think it my duty to submit without murmuring against what is not to be helped. In our Government, opposition to the acts of a majority of the people is rebellion to all intents and purposes; and I should view a man who would now endeavour to excite commotions against this plan, as no better than an insurgent who took arms last winter against the Courts of Justice.…"

Letter,Yes,Silas Lee,George Thatcher,,,2/14/1788,"As antifederal as you may think me, I can sincerely congratulate you on the adoption of the N. Constitution in this Commonwealth—It has ever been, as it now is, my opinion, that that is the safest of the Alternatives—Notwithstanding I have great doubts whether the Liberties of the people are not exceedingly e[n]dangered by it—and the Idea of an amendment, together with the further consideration that something Must immediately be done, & that this Country can scarcely be in a worse situation, are far the greatest arguments in my mind to Justify its ratification. From what you have heretofore wrote me, I have been led to think that you saw no imperfection at all, in the plan, & that you espoused its adoption, not with the violence & implacability of a partizan, who condemns every man to the stake, or halter, that is not of his colour; that I knew was impossible, but rather, with the resolute warmth of an honest Man, who was possitive that he was right—and I confess to you that I feel not a little flattered to find from your last letter, that my Sentiments have not been wholly opposed to yours—& that you seem to think it wants amendments—which I hope will immediately be taken into Consideration—But I hope the precedent of the late federal Convention will not be followed by the next that may be appointed; viz instead of revising or amending this in certain parts, [1700]which may be found inconvenient, they will not with one Stroke wipe the whole away, as was the fate of the old Confederation, & propose a new one; but on the contrary provide a remedy for the inconveniencies felt, without interfering with or altering the advantages already experienced—But, altho you say, that “it will ever be as easy to alter & amend, as it can be to form another, if not more so,” you seem to think, by what follows, that every General Convention will propose a plan of their own—notwithstanding, I suppose you must mean, their commission impowers them only to amend—This I have ever understood was the fact in the late federal convention But altho compossd of the first characters in the Continent I, by no means, think it the less unwarrantable on that account—when Officers throw aside their commissions, or Servants their orders, then the liberties of the people depend entirely upon the humour of the one, & the property of the Master on the uncertain conduct of the other, which may be good or bad as the disposition of the agent may happen to be—& then indeed all Laws or rules are wholly aflut[.] But as to the Constitution, it is established in this State & I doubt not but it will soon be through out the whole—I shall therefore find no more fault with it, but rather examine & enquire into it for the sake of information—hoping that it will prove to be not only the best in the world, but also that the people will be perfectly happy under it—In a former letter I mentioned Mr Wilson2—I believe I was wrong then, in part at least. At another time I may explain myself—I differ so far from the opinions of your friends with you, respecting the Opposition in this State, that on the contrary, I am surprised at the struggle that was made—I think Most of the Opposers have done honour to their places, both by the ingenuity of some of their arguments, & the liberality of their Conduct after the decission.…"

Letter,Yes,John Quincy Adams,William Cranch,,,2/16/1788,"Mr. Parsons, brought me, a volume of the defence2 &c. with a packet from Europe, and a Letter from you; I had expected them for four or five weeks, and was very fearful they had miscarried. I would caution you not to give any letters nor packets for me to Mr. Parsons, unless it be just before he is coming home, for he is generally so much engaged it business when at Boston, that he would never think of forwarding letters entrusted to him. The great Question it seems is decided, and according to your wishes, you and Freeman3 are both pretty confident, that I should have been converted, had I attended the debates: this I will acknowledge, that had I been a member, it is probable I should have given a federal vote; not from the arguments and characters which favoured that side, but from those which appeared on the other. Not because a Dana, a King, a Parsons, a Bowdoin, a Hancock and a long train of the fathers of their Country supported the Constitution, with all the captivating charms of eloquence, and the weighty influence of conscious integrity, but because, a Willard, a Spring, a Thompson, a Bishop, and a number more who have appeared to wish nothing but a subversion of all government, were the only opposers.—The great points upon which the opposition in my mind was founded, were scarcely mentioned in convention; I must freely acknowledge, that I still lament, the want of an adequate representation of the people, and of rotation in the offices of government: the blending of the legislative and executive powers in the Senate; and the indefinite powers granted to the administrators; but I am convinced that opposition now would be attended with immediate evils, without being productive of any good effects, and you may now consider me as a strong federalist; though I should make a poor disputant in favour of that side.—The convention in New Hampshire are now in session. The appearances are against the Constitution; but the influence of abilities, of property, and of example will probably have the same effect there that they had in our convention, and a small majority may decide in imitation of Massachusetts.…"

Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle,,2/21/1788,"Mess’rs ADAMS & NOURSE, If you can find room in your useful Paper, for the following LETTER, from a Gentleman in Worcester County, to his Friend in Suffolk, you will gratify me,—and I hope, not displease any of your Customers. DEAR SIR, The Federal Constitution, I find, is at length adopted, by the Convention of this Commonwealth.—Shall I congratulate you on this great event? Were my feelings congenial with your’s, I undoubtedly should: Possibly they are so, more fully than you imagine. You know I have had my doubts, difficulties and fears, respecting the system of government; for which you have been a steady and powerful advocate. Many of my fears you have removed, by your kind communications, in private:—Others have been dissipated, by looking over the debates of Convention, which have been given to us in the public prints. Though I cannot say my mind is entirely satisfied, in every point, it is so far, that upon the whole, I rather rejoice than mourn, at the determination of that respectable body. The object in your mind, is now undoubtedly shifted, or rather advanced, from the adoption, to the support of this plan of government, by obtaining a good administration. In this I shall most cordially unite my endeavours with yours: And so I doubt not will multitudes, who were not quite clear as to the propriety of adopting it. I was highly pleased with what, I understand, a number of the minority said, immediately after the question was decided.—This was much to their honor:—Dr. T-yl-r, of D—, I perceive, said “He was fairly beaten, and he was determined to go home, and endeavour to cultivate a spirit of peace and harmony.”1 I hope he will do as he said. I rejoice to find this pacific disposition considerably prevalent in this county—in which there were, I understand, a greater number of NAYS, than in any other;2 I wish it may increase more and more;—My exertions for that purpose, so far as I can make them, without acting out of character, [1706]will not be wanting. I have been greatly pleased, in hearing a number, who were among the opponents, express their hope, that the Constitution would operate for the general good; and their determination, readily to submit to, and support it—and use their influence with their connections and friends to do the same. They remarked, (and I think very justly) that a ready and quiet submission to a majority, in such cases, is the great principle of all republican government, without which it cannot be maintained. I am glad to find that the Delegates from this county, and I trust of all the other counties, acknowledge the debates in the Convention, were conducted with great candor, fairness and impartiality;—That the leading speakers in favour of the Constitution, endeavoured, with all the marks of tenderness, friendship, and brotherly affection, to answer the objections of the opponents, and remove the difficulties from their minds; and that the decision was finally made with great decorum, without any appearance of triumph or exultation, in the majority. I have remarked to several, that the inhabitants of this county can have no pretence for justifying an opposition to the government, under this Constitution, till a full and sufficient experiment is made of its operation. Worcester county, though not possessed of so much property, nor taxed so great a sum, as either Suffolk or Essex, yet had a greater number of Delegates in Convention, than either of them.3 The people were fully represented. And I could also remark, with truth (though I chuse to avoid every thing irritating) that this county has been ever since the war, and now is, much more delinquent in seasonably paying their quota of taxes into the public treasury, than either of the counties I mentioned, or several others; which hath been a hardship on those that have made the most prompt payment; as they have been obliged to pay a part of interest money, which would never have become due, had all the counties paid as seasonably as they. I hope the friends to liberty, as connected with, and founded on good government, (and I know of no other political liberty) in all parts of the State, will use their utmost endeavours, in every wise and prudent way, to quiet and conciliate the minds of those who have not thought so favourably of this system of government—so far at least, as to render them willing to make a fair and full trial of its operation: And I hope they will find the beneficial effects of it much greater than they have been ready to expect; and that the evils which they feared from it were but imaginary. By experiment, the defects of it (and defects there are in every thing produced by human wisdom) will be best discovered; and what articles need alteration and amendment. I have confidence that the amendments proposed by our worthy Governour, will soon be made, and become part of the Constitution. [1707]And I think the door is open to obtain any others, that may be found necessary. This hath reconciled me to the adoption of the plan; and I feel myself more and more happy in the hopeful prospect, that it will be instrumental, under Providence, and in the hands of a good administration, to free us from many of our present embarrassments. It will, I am confident, be as beneficial to the landed interest, as to commerce. I trust it will promote the free circulation of money—and give new life and vigor to every branch of business. Pray write me, how the few in your county, who were opposed to it, now stand affected, since its adoption. I am, dear sir, with affection and esteem, Yours, &c."

Letter,No,John Bacon,Elbridge Gerry,,,2/27/1788,"The letter which you did me the honor to address to me some time before I had the pleasure of seeing you in Boston, has never come into my hands. Soon after I returned from Boston, I called at the Post Office, & was informed that a letter had been lodged there for me; but on examining the Office, it could not be found. It had been seen & noticed by several Persons who were in the Office, the day that I called for it; & by some of them, undoubtedly taken & secreted. Being ignorant of the purport of the letter, T shall not be so likely to get hold of a Clew by which I might possibly be able to detect the person who has been guilty of this base Conduct. The New Constitution, it seems, has been ratified by the Convention of this State. Is it now in such a Situation that no further attempt to prevent its Establishment can, with propriety, be made on the part of this Commonwealth? Might the Legislature, in their present Session, consistantly take up the Matter, & recommend to the Inhabitants of the several Towns, at their next Elections, to authorize their Representatives to reconsider the Doings of the late Convention of this State on the Constitution, & to ratify the same, with such amendments as they may judge necessary? I am, I confess, in doubt, both as to the propriety of a measure like this, & also, as to the prospect of Success, if it should be attempted. I will venture, however, to inclose the form of a Resolve2 which, in my solitary moments, I have drawn for this purpose, & wish to submit the Eligibility of an attempt of this kind to your wise consideration. I feel a considerable degree of anxiety respecting the Government that seems to be on the point of gaining an Establishment, & find the want of a discreet & wellinformed Friend whom I might, in confidence, consult. Should you think fit to communicate the Purport of this Resolve to any judicious Friend, or Member of the Genl Court, you will be pleased to do it with caution, & in confidence. If you should think it best (as you probably will) that no attempt of this kind should be made, I must ask the favor that you would keep the whole, as coming from me, a profound Secret. I perceive that on my leaving Boston, I was immediately represented as having again changed my Sentiments respecting the Constitution. This, like some other Reports, is without the least Foundation in Truth: Whether this was designed to influence any particular Member of the Convention with whom I might be supposed to have some small degree of Interest; or only to represent me as a mere changeling, is immaterial: I find it was urged for the Purposes of both. I wish that an early & prudent attention might be paid to Elections, both in the National & State, Legislative & Executive Departments of Government. I conceive it to be a matter of special Importance, that when we begin to practice on a Constitution like that which is now [1712]before us, we should have Men in the Administration, who, from Principle & Habit, are firmly attached to the Liberties of the People, & the Rights of the particular States.3 Such Presidents [i.e., precedents] may be early made as may be attended with permanent Effects, & serve to establish an Authority next to that which is expressly prescribed in the Constitution itself. I am not able to determine what proportion of the People in this County are in favor of the Constitution, or whether it has now a greater or less number of friends than it had before its Ratification by the Convention of this State. I was sensible, while I was in Boston, that the Opposition suffered exceedingly by being conducted by unskilful hands. I am persuaded that a small number of able Men in the Convention, well skilled in publick Controversy, would have had an easy task to have prevented the Ratification. Be pleased to present my most cordial Salutations to Mrs. Gerry. P.S. Since writing the above, I am happy to find that Col Williams Representative from W. Stockbridge is going to the Genl.

Newspaper,No,A Customer,,Cumberland Gazette,,3/1/1788,"Friend Wait, We are now in a hopeful way. The lower class fall in with the views of some of the better sort who reprebate the old-fashioned ideas of 1775. viz. that the common people were good judges in the affairs of government; and that their time was well spent when it was devoted to the study of politicks and religion-the latter of which was then supposed to be necessary to the well being of civil society. I We leave our share in the general government. to ten men; and our State matters may soon be reduced. As to religion. our great folks are not obliged to make a declaration on that score; and if the lower class. who are desirous to imitate those who move in a higher sphere. should once be made to believe it unfashionable. we may tum our clergy a grazing-and employ our time. that heretofore has been employed in politicks and religion. to the pursuit of wealth. to enable us to pay our debts, and support the dependants on government in the style of the great men of the east. I have one difficulty in my mind respecting our admirable Constitution, which I hope somebody will attempt to remove. Art. 3. sect. I-The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America: he shall hold his office during the term off our years. Here is no declaration that a new one shall be chosen at the expiration of that time. Congress may determine the time of chusing the electors; and the day on which they shall give their votes. But suppose they should think it for the publick good, after the first election, to appoint the first Tuesday of September, in the year two thousand, for the purpose of chusing the second President; and by law empower the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court to act as President until that time. However disagreeable it might be to the majority of the States, I do not see but that they are left without a remedy, provided four States should be satisfied with the measure. The President elected is not to receive any other emolument; yet the Chief Justice is not disqualified as a Judge. Why did our worthy Chief Justice, at Cambridge the year past, in his address to the Grand Jury, call upon them to support that free and excellent Constitution, which it has lost the blood of thousands of our friends and fellow citizens to establish: that Constitution which has carefully separated and distinguished the principal departments of power-that they might never combine against the liberty of the subject:2 if it is not a necessary article in a constitution? If necessary in a State constitution, why not in one for the whole people? Was it not as easy to have said the President should be chosen every fourth year, as to have said the Representatives shall be chosen every second year? The celebrated Mr. King observes that this is not a confederation of States-for the style is in the name of the people: 3 therefore, it appears to me, the rights of the people should be as well guarded, on this point, here, as in the constitution of a State. I send you a few pounds of flax-a most excellent article. It will employ the idle, who may be out of business, to tum it into cloth; and when reduced to rags, it will be useful to make paper for your business. And if in some future day your press should be stopped, it will make small cords to tickle the idle and restless, and to bind the turbulent to their good behaviour.

Other,No,Phanuel Bishop,,,,3/5/1788,"You have undoubtedly seen our governor’s speech, and his encomiums therein on the proposed constitution; to which an answer, or rather echo, was prepared, and reported, to the legislature. The whigs, in the house of representatives were highly exasperated at the measure, and prepared an amendment. This terrified the federalists, as they stile themselves (that is, the gentry who opposed the British government because it was arbitrary, and who now are in favor of one infinitely more so) and produced a proposition from them, “that the matter should subside,” as well the report as the amendment-thus you see that the representatives of the people of this state are not converts of federalism, a term which has the same meaning now which toryism had before the war.” The AMENDMENT mentioned in the above letter. Your Excellency is pleased to inform us, that the convention which was appointed to deliberate upon the constitution and frame of government for the United States of America, agreed upon by the late general convention, have concluded their sessions after having adopted and ratified the proposed plan. We have long been sensible of the imbecility of the confederation of the United States, and of the consequences of that imbecility, and therefore appointed delegates to the late general convention, for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and confirmed by the states, render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union! If they had observed, and acted agreeably to their commission, no difficulty perhaps would have arisen from the numbers of a people spread over a vast extent of territory, containing such a great variety of soils, and under such extremes of climate, and with such different views and habits while they were so well united in that one object, [228page icon]we are fully persuaded that our national existence might in that way have been preserved with unanimity, tranquility and peace. We do not wish to be known to the world under any other appellation than that of the United States. In confederation and union with our sister states, we have happily baffled the intrigues and defeated the force of Great-Britain, have supported the rights of mankind, and secured the freedom and independence of America. While we wish to preserve the union entire, and are fully sensible of the ill consequences of an interruption of it, we are sorry to differ from your Excellency in the mode of effecting the first and avoiding the last.–Every good government should have for its objects defence against external enemies, and the promotion9 of internal tranquility and happiness. While we suspend our opinion of the purity of intention, and of the great zeal for the interest10 and welfare with which the late convention assembled, we are in justice to our constituents constrained to say that the result of their deliberations does not seem well calculated for those valuable purposes. We shall, under this head, only add, that the rights and liberties of a great country should stand on firmer ground than that of mere probability. If the amendments proposed with the ratification of the late convention, had been made a condition of ratification, they would have gone some way, though not fully, to a conciliation of our minds to the system, but your Excellency will permit us to say, that, as they now stand, they neither comport with the dignity or safety of the Commonwealth."
Newspaper,No,David,,Massachusetts Gazette,,3/7/1788,"Mess’rs Adams and Nourse. If your customers pay for folly, and nonsense, they have a right to make their observations upon such productions, as answer no good end, but may be subservient to many base purposes. When number one of the papers signed Numa, appeared in the Independent Chronicle, the general idea was, that some young lad lately from a College, or an Academy, had introduced himself to the world, in a foppish imitation of periodical writers, who have favoured the public with papers in Europe. A great part of that paper was copied from introductory pieces, of that nature, published in England. It was very easy to distinguish between that part which was copied from other authors, and that which was originated by Numa. The language borrowed was soft, flowing and easy, and the ideas perfectly expressed, the sentiments full and entertaining, and the objects pursued in a masterly manner. But in the original of Numa, the language was strained, fettered, and inelegant; the ideas lean and inexpressive, the sentiment [37]flat, insipid, and imperfect, and so many unseperated objects distracted the attention, that the reader could derive no other pleasure than what was gathered in a swamp of incoherent and jarring thoughts. This writer’s pretensions, of being in the cabinets, and closets, of every rank and order of men; his setting himself up as the standard of political rectitude, and his determination to expose all measures, which should be either politically or morally wrong; was so very ridiculous, that the whole literary circle considered it, as the wild vagaries of a school boy, and gave it the contempt it merited. But when in the succeeding papers, he attacked, by vile insinuations, the characters of men whom the people had placed in office, and calumniated those whose virtues and perseverance purchased the revolution, and established the freedom of America: it was readily discerned, that he was no other, than the tool of those, who are the enemies of our free, and happy government. His scandal can however do but little hurt in this state, the people are well aware of the necessity of restoring peace and tranquility, and are perfectly assured, that a number of men, who have pretended to be disgusted at the late unhappy commotions, secretly rejoice at the opportunity of establishing, under pretence of necessity, a tyrannical rule; in the room of our free, and happy constitution. A certain mark by which these are distinguished, is their repeated declarations, that the people have not virtue enough to bear a free government, when in fact nothing has taken place here, but what has happened in every form of government yet established in the world. This writer has been considered as a tool of a disappointed party, and as such, an harmless animal. But the production number five [i.e., seven], seems to indicate him the stingless enemy of his country at large, rather than the weak, and inefficatious partisan to support a particular form of government. What an unnecessary tumult of ill joined, and incoherent ideas, are thrown together in this number, in favour of the report of the convention, which he then knew nothing about. While every one in the community was filled with hope, and expectation, at the then unknown report of that body, this writer is opening wide the jaws of distrust, and jealousy, by calling upon the people to accept it, let it be what it would. And alarming their fears, by trying to persuade them, that their circumstances were such, that they must accept whatever was proposed. When in fact, all we could say, was, that we had reason to expect from the characters which compose the convention, that their system would be quite agreeable to their fellow citizens, and that we had the highest reason to believe that the people would examine it with candor, and [38]wisdom, and adopt it with readiness if it was right. The imprudence of one paragraph, is equalled only by the inelegance of its expression, “I can’t suppress the pain produced by the late authentic information, which the public has received, that one in high office in a neighboring state, has unreservedly declared against the federal convention.” I cannot suppress my inclination to express the pain I feel at such a silly expression, of a very injudicious, imprudent, and dangerous insinuation—Numa no doubt means Governour Clinton, and what he calls “authentic information,” is the dark insinuation of an anonymous party writer like himself, and the insinuation of that writer is as groundless, as those which this foppish partizan has thrown out against other characters, who have by their exertions for the public weal done much for the happiness of the people, and justly possess their confidence. Governor Clinton’s character is so well established, as an early, wise, and intrepid patriot, that the barely publishing him as an enemy to the proceedings of the convention, would make many men of consideration in the United States, hesitate respecting it. But the public may be assured, that his Excellency is far from meriting such abuse, and that this treatment proceeds only, from the firm, and fixed hatred, which a certain Junto in this State, have to every one who was early in the principles of the late revolution. This cabal, under the signature of Numa, Honorious, &c. are trying to disturb the peace of the Commonwealth, and to establish a regal and despotic state, but the people by a proper submission to law and government, will subvert their nafarious plan. These men are chagrined at the return Of peace. They have long been in the sentiment, that we could not live under a free government, and their last chance is, to bring the people to a loss of their confidence, in those who have led them through the revolution, and sat down with them in a land of freedom."

Newspaper,No,"Consider Arms, Malachi Maynard, Samuel Field",,Hampshire Gazette,,4/9/1788,"Mr. Printer, We the Subscribers being of the number, who did not assent to the ratification of the Federal Constitution, under consideration in the late State Convention, held at Boston, to which we were called by the suffrages of the corporations to which we respectively belong—beg leave, through the channel of your paper, to lay before the public in general, and our constituents in particular, the reasons of our dissent, and the principles which governed us in our decision of this important question. Fully convinced, ever since the late revolution, of the necessity of a firm, energetic government, we should have rejoiced in an opportunity to have given our assent to such an one; and should in the present case, most cordially have done it, could we at the same time [have] been happy to have seen the liberties of the people and the rights of mankind properly guarded and secured. We conceive that the very notion of government carries along with it the idea of justice and equity, and that the whole design of instituting government in the world, was to preserve men’s properties from rapine, and their bodies from violence and bloodshed. These propositions being established, we conceive must of necessity produce the following consequence, viz. That every constitution or system, which does not quadrate with this original design, is not government, but in fact a subversion of it. Having premised thus much, we proceed to mention some things in this constitution, to which we object, and to enter into an enquiry, whether, and how far they coincide with those simple and original notions of government beforementioned. In the first place—as direct taxes are to be apportioned according to the numbers in each state, and as Massachusetts has none in it but what are declared freemen, so the whole, blacks as well as whites, must be numbered; this must therefore operate against us, as two fifths of the slaves in the southern states are to be left out of the numeration; consequently, three Massachusetts infants will increase the tax equal to five sturdy, full grown negroes of theirs, who work every day in the [1734]week for their masters, saving the Sabbath, upon which they are allowed lo get something for their own support. We can see no justice in this way of apportioning taxes; neither can we see any good reason why this was consented to on the part of our delegates. We suppose it next to impossible that every individual in this vast continental union, should have his wish with regard to every single a tide, composing a frame of government; and therefore, although we think it more agreeable to the principles of republicanism, that elections should be annual; yet as the elections in our own state government are so, we did not view it so dangerous to the liberties of the people, that we should have rejected the constitution merely on account of the biennial elections of the representatives, had we been sure that the people have any security, even of this; but this we could [not] find. For although it is said, that “the House of Representatives shall be chosen every second year, by the people of the several states,” &c. and that “the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof;” yet all this is wholly superseded by a subsequent provision, which empowers Congress at any time to enact a law, whereby such regulations may be altered, except as to the places of chusing senators. Here we conceive the people may be very materially injured, and in time reduced to a state of as abject vassallage, as any people were under the controul of the most mercenary despot, that ever tarnished the pages of history. The depravity of human nature, illustrated by examples from history, will warrant us to say, it may be possible, if not probable, that the Congress may be composed of men, who will wish to burthen and oppress the people. In such case, will not their inventions be fruitful enough to devise occasions for postponing the elections? And if they can do this once, they can twice—if they can twice they can thrice, so by degrees render themselves absolute and perpetual. Or, if they choose, they have another expedient; they can alter the place of holding elections. They can say, whatever the legislature of this state may order to the contrary, that all the elections of our representatives shall be made at Mechias, or at Williamstown; consequently, nine-tenths of the people will never vote. And if this should be thought a measure favourable to their re-election, or the election of some tool for their mercenary purposes, we doubt not it will be thus ordered. But says the advocates for the constitution, “it is not likely this will ever happen; we are not to expect our rulers will ever proceed to a wanton exercise of the powers given them.” But what reason have we more than past ages, to expect that we shall be blessed with impeccable rulers? we think not any. Although it has been said that every generation grows wiser and wiser, yet we have no reason to think they [1735]grow better and better. And therefore the probability lies upon the dark side. Does not the experience of past ages teach, that men have generally exercised all the powers they had given them, and even have usurped upon them, in order to accomplish their own sinister and avaricious designs, whenever they thought they could do it with impunity? This we presume will not be denied. And it appeared to us that the arguments made use of by the favourers of the constitution, in the late Convention at Boston, proceeded upon the plan of righteousness in those who are to rule over us, by virtue of this new form of government. But these arguments, we confess, could have no weight with us, whilst we judged them to be founded altogether upon a slippery perhaps. We are sensible, that in order to the due administration of government, it is necessary that certain powers should be delegated to the rulers, from the people. At the same time we think they ought carefully to guard against giving so much as will enable those rulers, by that means, at once, or even in process of time, to render themselves absolute and despotic. This we think is the case with the form of government lately submitted to our consideration. We could not, therefore, acting uprightly, consulting our own good and the good of our constituents, give our assent unto it. We could not then, we still cannot see, that because people are many times guilty of crimes, and deserving of punishment, that it from thence follows the authority ought to have power to punish them when they are not guilty, or to punish the innocent with the guilty without discrimination, which amounts to the same thing. But this we think in fact to be the case as to this federal constitution. For the Congress, whether they have provocation or not, can at any time order the elections in any or all the states, to be conducted in such manner as wholly to defeat and render entirely nugatory the intention of those elections, and convert that which was considered and intended to be the palladium of the liberties of the people—the grand bulwark against any invasion upon them, into a formidable engine, by which to overthrow them all, and thus involve them in the depth of misery and distress. But it was pled by some of the ablest advocates of the constitution, that if Congress should exercise such powers to the prejudice of the people (and they did not deny but they could if they should be disposed) they (the people) would not suffer it. They would have recourse to the ultima ratio the dernier resort of the oppressed—the sword. But it appeared to us a piece of superlative incongruity indeed! that the people, whilst in the full and indefeasible possession of their liberties and privileges, should be so very profuse, so very liberal in the disposal of them, as consequently to place themselves in a predicament [1736]miserable to an extreme—so wretched indeed, that they may at once be reduced to the sad alternative of yielding themselves vassals into the hands of a venal and corrupt administration, whose only wish may be to aggrandize themselves and families—to wallow in luxury and every species of discipation, and riot upon the spoils of the community; or take up the sword and involve their country in all the horrors of a civil war—the consequence of which, we think, we may venture to augur will more firmly rivet their shackles, and end in the entailment of vassallage to their posterity. We think this by no means can fall within the description of government beforementioned: Neither can we think these suggestions merely chimerical, or that they proceed from an over heated enthusiasm in favour of republicanism; neither yet from an ill-placed detestation of aristocracy; but from the apparent danger the people are in by establishing this constitution. When we take a forward view of the proposed Congress, seated in the federal city, ten miles square, fortified and replenished with all kinds of military stores, and every implement—with a navy at command on one side, and a land army on the other. We say, when we view them, thus possessed of the sword in one hand and the purse-strings of the people in the other, we cm see no security left for them in the enjoyment of their liberties, but what may proceed from the bare possibility, that this supreme authority of the nation may be possessed of virtue and integrity sufficient to influence them in the administration of equal justice and equity among those whom they shall govern. But why should we voluntarily choose to trust our all upon so precarious a tenure as this? We confess it gives us pain to anticipate the future scene: a scene presenting to view miseries so complicated and extreme, that it may be part of the charms of eloquence to extenuate, or the power of art to remove.1"

Mr. King himself, who was an assistant in forming this constitution, in discoursing upon the slave trade, in the late Convention at Boston, was pleased to design it by this epithet, nefarious, which carries with it the idea of something peculiarly wicked and abominable:2 and indeed we think it deserving of this and every odious epithet which our language affords, descriptive [1737]of the iniquity of it. This being the case, we were naturally led to enquire why we should establish a constitution, which gives licence to a measure of this sort—How is it possible we could do it consistent with our ideas of government? consistent with the principles and documents we endeavour to inculcate upon others? It is a standing law in the kingdom of Heaven, “Do unto others as ye would have others do unto you.”3 This is the royal law—this we often hear inculcated upon others. But had we given our affirmative voice in this case, could we have claimed to ourselves that consistent line of conduct, which marks the path of every honest man? Should we not rather have been guilty of a contumelious repugnancy, to what we profess to believe is equitable and just? Let us for once bring the matter home to ourselves, and summons up our own feelings upon the occasion, and hear the simple sober verdict of our own hearts, were we in the place of those unhappy Africans—this is the test, the proper touch-stone by which to try the matter before us. Where is the man, who under the influence of sober dispassionate reasoning, and not void of natural affection, can lay his hand upon his heart and say, I am willing my sons and my daughters should be torn from me and doomed to perpetual slavery? We presume that man is not to be found amongst us: And yet we think the consequence is fairly drawn, that this is what every man ought to be able to say, who voted for this constitution. But we dare say this will never be the case here, so long as the country has power to repel force by force. Notwithstanding this we will practise this upon those who are destitute of the power of repulsion: from whence we conclude it is not the tincture of a skin, or any disparity of features that are necessarily connected with slavery, and possibly may therefore fall to the lot of some who voted it, to have the same measure measured unto them which they have measured unto others. If we could once make it our own case, we should soon discover what distress & anxiety, what poignant feelings it would produce in our own breasts, to have our infants torn from the bosoms of their tender mothers—indeed our children of all ages, from infancy to manhood, arrested from us by a banditti of lawless ruffians, in defiance of all the laws of humanity, and carried to a country far distant, without any hopes of their return—attended likewise with the cutting reflection, that they were likely to undergo all those indignities, those miseries, which are the usual concomitants of slavery. Indeed when we consider the depredations committed in Africa, the cruelties exercised towards the poor captivated inhabitants of that country on their passage to this—crowded by droves into the holds of ships, suffering what might naturally be expected would result from scanty provisions, and inelastic infectious air, and after their arrival, drove like brutes from market to market, branded on their naked bodies with hot [1738] irons, with the initial letters of their masters names—fed upon the entrails of beasts like swine in the slaughter-yard of a butcher; and many other barbarities, of which we have documents well authenticated: then put to the hardest of labour, and to perform the vilest of drudges—their master (or rather usurpers) by far less kind and benevolent to them, than to their horses and their hounds. We say, when we consider these things (the recollection of which gives us pain) conscience applauds the dicision we have made, and we feel that satisfaction which arises from acting agreeable to its dictates. When we hear those barbarities pled for—When we see them voted for, (as in the late Convention at Boston) when we see them practised by those who denominate themselves Christians, we are presented with something truely heterogeneous—something monstrous indeed! Can we suppose this line of conduct keeps pace with the rule of right? Do such practices coincide with the plain and simple ideas of government beforementioned? By no means. We could wish it might be kept in mind, that the very notion of government is to protect men in the enjoyment of those privileges to which they have a natural, therefore an indefeasible right; and not to be made an engine of rapine, robbery and murder. This is but establishing inequity, by law founded on usurpation. Establishing this constitution is, in our opinion[,] establishing the most ignominious kind of theft, man-stealing, and so heinous and agrivated was this crime considered, by one who cannot err, that under the Jewish theocracy it was punished with death.4 Indeed what can shew men scarcely more hardened, than being guilty of this crime? for there is nothing else they will stick at in order to perpetrate this. The question therefore—Why should we vote for the establishment of this system? recoils upon us armed with treple force—force which sets at defiance, the whole power of sophistry, employed for the defence of those, who by a “cursed thirst for gold,”5 are prompted on to actions, which cast an indelible stain upon the character of the human species—actions at which certain quadrupeds, were they possessed of Organs for the purpose, would discover a BLUSH. But we were told by an honourable gentleman who was one of the framers of this Constitution, that the two souther[n] most states, absolutely refused to confederate at all, except they might be gratified in this article.6 What then? Was this an argument sufficient to induce us to give energy to this article, thus fraught with iniquity? By no means. But we were informed by that gentleman, further that those two states pled, that they had lost much of their property during the late war. Their slaves being either taken from them by the British troops, or they themselves taking the liberty of absconding from them, and therefore [1739]they must import more, in order to make up their losses. To this we say they lost no property, because they never had any in them, however much money they might have paid for them. For we look upon it, every man is the sole proprietor of his own liberty, and no one but himself hath a right to convey it unless by some crime adequate to the punishment, it should be made forfeit, and so by that means becomes the property of government: But this is by no means the case in the present instance. And we cannot suppose a vendee, can acquire property in any thing, which at the time of purchase, he knew the vendor had no right to convey. This is an acknowledgment, we are constrained to make as a tribute due to justice and equity. But suppose they had lost real property; so have we; and indeed where is the man, but will tell us he has been a great looser by means of the war? And shall we from thence argue that we have a right to make inroads upon another nation, pilfer and rob them, in order to compensate ourselves for the losses we have sustained by means of a war, in which they had been utterly neutral? Truly upon this plan of reasoning it is lawful thus to do, and had we voted the constitution as it stands, we must have given countenance to conduct equally criminal, and more so, if possible. Such arguments as the above seem to be calculated and designed for idiotcy. We however acknowledge, we think them rather an affront, even upon that. The hon. Gentleman above named, was asked the question—What would be the consequence, suppose one or two states, upon any principle, should refuse confederating? His answer was—“The consequence is plain and easy—they would be compelled to it; not by force of arms; but all commerce with them would be interdicted; their property would be seized in every port they should enter, and by law made forfeit: and this line of conduct would soon reduce them to order.” This method of procedure perhaps no one would be disposed to reprehend; and if eleven, or even nine states were agreed, could they not, ought they not to take this method, rather than to make a compact with them, by which they give countenance, nay even bind themselves (as the case may be) to aid and assist them in spor[t]ing with the liberties of others, and accumulating to themselves fortunes, by making thousands of their fellow creatures miserable. To animadvert upon the British manœvres at that time, would not fall within the compass of our present design. But that the Africans had a right to depart, we must assert, and are able to prove it from the highest authority perhaps that this Commonwealth does or ever did afford. In a printed pamphlet, published in Boston in the year 1772, said to be the report of a Committee, and unanimously voted by said town, and ordered to be sent to the several towns in the state for their consideration. In said pamphlet we find the following [1740]axiom, which we will quote verbatim,—page 2d—“All men have a right to remain in a state of nature as long as they please, and in case of intolerable oppression, civil or religious, to leave the society they belong to, and enter into another.”7 If it can by any kind of reasoning be made to appear, that this authority is not pertinently adduced in the case before us, then we think it can by the same reasoning be investigated, that black is white and white is black—that oppression and freedom are exactly similar, and benevolence and malignity synonymous terms. The advocates for the constitution seemed to suppose, that this restriction being laid upon Congress only for a term of time, is the “fair dawning of liberty.” That “it was a glorious acquisition towards the final abolition of slavery.”8 But how much more glorious would the acquisition have been, was such abolition to take place the first moment the constitution should be established. If we had said that after the expiration of a certain term the practice should cease, it would have appeared with a better grace; but this is not the case, for even after that, it is wholly optional with the Congress, whether they abolish it or not. And by that time we presume the enslaving the Africans will be accounted by far less an inconsiderable affair than it is at present: therefore conclude from good reasons, that the “nefarious practice” will be continued and increased as the inhabitants of the country shall be found to increase. This practice of enslaving mankind is in direct opposition to a fundamental maxim of truth, on which our state constitution is founded, viz. “All men are born free and equal.”9 This is our motto. We have said it—we cannot go back. Indeed no man can justify himself in enslaving another, unless he can produce a commission under the broad seal of Heaven, purporting a licence therefore from him who created a 1 men, and can therefore dispose of them at his pleasure. We would not be thought to detract from the character of any person, but to us it is somewhat nearly paradoxical, that some of our leading characters in the law department (especially in the western counties) after having (to their honour be it spoken) exerted themselves to promote, and finally to effect the emancipation of slaves, should now turn directly about, and exhibit to the world principles diametrically opposite thereto: that they should now appear such strenuous advocates for the establishment of that diabolical trade of importing the Africans.10 But said some, it is not we who do it—and compared it to entering into an alliance with another nation, for some particular purpose; but we think this by no means a parallel. We are one nation, forming a constitution for the whole, and suppose the states are under obligation, whenever this constitution shall be established, reciprocally [1741]to aid each other in defence and support of every thing to which they are entitled thereby, right or wrong. Perhaps we may never be called upon to take up arms for the defence of the southern states, in prosecuting this abominable traffick. It is true at present there is not much danger to be apprehended, and for this plain reason are those innocent Africans (as to us) pitched upon to drag out their lives in misery and chains. Such is their local situation—their unpolished manners—their inexperience in the art of war, that those invaders of the rights of mankind know they can, at present, perpetrate those enormities with impunity. But let us suppose for once, a thing which is by no means impossible, viz. that those Africans should rise superior to all their local and other disadvantages, and attempt to avenge themselves for the wrongs done them? Or suppose some potent nation should interfere in their behalf, as France in the cause of America, must we not rise and resist them? Would not the Congress immediately call forth the whole force of the country, if needed, to oppose them, and so attempt more closely to rivet their manacles upon them, and in that way perpetuate the miseries of those unhappy people? This we think the natural consequence which will flow from the establishment of this constitution, and that it is not a forced, but a very liberal construction of it. It was said that “the adoption of this Constitution, would be ominous of much good, and betoken the smiles of Heaven upon the country.” But we view the matter in a very different light; we think this lurch for unjust gains, this lust for slavery, portentous of much evil in America, for the cry of innocent blood, which hath been shed in carrying on this execrable commerce, hath undoubtedly reached to the Heavens, to which that cry is always directed, and will draw down upon them vengeance adequate to the enormity of the crime. To what other cause, than a full conviction, of the moral evil in this practice, together with some fearful forebodings of punishment therefor arising in the minds of the Congress in the year 1774, can it be imputed, that drew from them at that time, (at least an implied) confession of guilt, and a solemn, explicit promise of reformation? This is a fact, but lest it should be disputed, we think it most safe for ourselves to lay before our readers, an extract from a certain pamphlet, entitled “Extracts from the votes and proceedings of the American Continental Congress, held at Philadelphia, on the 5th of September, 1774, &c.” In the 22d page of this same pamphlet, we find the following paragraph, viz. “Second. That we will neither import, nor purchase any slave imported, after the first day of December next; after which time we will wholly discontinue the slave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels nor [1742]sell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it.”11 The inconsistency of opposing slavery, which they thought designed for themselves, and by clandestine means, procuring others to enslave at the same time—it is very natural to suppose would stare them in the face, and at all times guard them against breaking their resolution. Hence it appears to us unaccountable strange, that any person who signed the above resolve, should sign the federal constitution. For do they not hold up to view principles diametrically opposite? Can we suppose that what was morally evil in the year 1774, has become in the year 1788, morally good? Or shall we change evil into good and good into evil, as often as we find it will serve a turn? We cannot but say the conduct of those who associated in the year 1774 in the manner above, and now appear advocates for this new constitution, is highly inconsistent, although we find such conduct has the celebrated names of a Washington and an Adams to grace it. And this may serve as a reason why we could not be wrought upon by another argument, which was made use of in the Convention in favour of the constitution, viz. the weight of names—a solid argument with some people who belonged to the Convention, and would have induced them to comply with measures of almost any kind. It was urged that the gentlemen who composed the federal Convention, were men of the greatest abilities, integrity and erudition, and had been the greatest contenders for freedom. We suppose it to be true, and that they have exemplified it, by the manner, in which they have earnestly dogmatized for liberty—But notwithstanding we could not view this argument, as advancing any where towards infallibility—because long before we entered upon the business of the Convention, we were by some means or other possessed with a notion (and we think from good authority) that “great men are not always wise.”12 And to be sure the weight of a name adduced to give efficacy to a measure where liberty is in dispute, cannot be so likely to have its intended effect, when the person designed by that name, at the same time he is brandishing his sword, in the behalf of freedom for himself—is likewise tyranizing over two or three hundred miserable Africans, as free born as himself. In fine we view this constitution as a curious piece of political mechanism, fabricated in such manner as may finally despoil the people of ail their privileges; and we are fully satisfied, that had the same system been offered to the people in the time of the contest with Great-Britain, the person offering the same would not have met the approbation of those who now appear the most strenuous advocates for it. We cannot slip this opportunity of manifesting our disgust at the unfair methods which were taken in order to obtain a vote in this state, which perhaps [1743]was the means of producing the small majority of nineteen, out of nearly three hundred and sixty members. What those methods were is well known. It is past dispute that the opposers of the constitution were, in sundry instances, treated in a manner utterly inconsistent with that respect which is due to every freeborn citizen of the commonwealth, especially when acting in the capacity of a representative. Notwithstanding what has been said, we would not have it understood, that we mean to be disturbers of the peace, should the states receive the constitution; but on the contrary, declare it our intention, as we think it our duty, to be subject to “the powers that be,”13 wherever our lot may be cast.

Newspaper,No,,,American Herald,,4/18/1788,"From a CORRESPONDENT. On Saturday the 29th of March last (which was just at the close of the session) a Resolve came down from the Senate, to the House of Representatives, for publishing, at the Expence of the Government, and under the patronage of the Legislature, an ADDRESS to the People from the late Convention in this Commonwealth.—As this Address was supposed to be an attempt to reconcile the People of this Commonwealth to the Tory proceedings of their late Delegates, the vote of the Senate was non-concurred by a vast majority, and with the most patriotic contempt and indignation, fully expressive of the sense of the People, with regard to the System which the Tories have so artfully fabricated and procured to be accepted in this and a few other States."
Newspaper,No,Elbridge Gerry,,American Herald,Landholder,4/18/1788,"To the PUBLIC. An elegant writer, under the signature of “A LANDHOLDER,’ having, in a series of publications, with a modesty and delicacy peculiar to himself, undertaken to instruct members of legislatures, executives, and conventions, in their duty respecting the new constitution, is, in stating facts, unfortunate, in being repeatedly detected in errors; but his perseverance therein does honor “to his magnanimity,’ and reminds me of Doctor Sangerado (in Gil Bias) who being advised to alter his practice, as it was founded on false principles and destructive to his patients, firmly determined to pursue it, because he had written a book in support of it.1 Had our learned author the modern Sangerado, confined himself to facts and to reasoning on the Constitution, he might have continued to write without interruption from its opposers, ’till by instructing others, he had obtained that instruction which he seems to need, or a temporary relief from that incurable malady, the cacoethes scribendi;2 but his frequent [1752]misrepresentations having exposed him to suspicions that as a disciple of Mandeville,3 he is an advocate for vice, or, that to correct his curiosity, some humourist has palmed on him a spurious history of the proceedings of the federal convention, and exhibited his credulity as a subject of ridicule, it is proper to set him right in facts, which, in almost every instance, he has mis[s]tated. In a late address to the honorable Luther Martin, Esq. the Landholder has asserted, that Mr. Gerry “uniformly opposed Mr. Martin’s principles;” but this is a circumstance wholly unknown to Mr. Gerry, until he was informed of it by the Connecticut Landholder; indeed Mr. Gerry, from his first acquaintance with Mr. Martin, has “uniformly” had a friendship for him. This writer has also asserted, “that the day Mr. Martin took his seat in convention, without requesting information, or to be let into the reasons of the adoption of what he might not approve, he opened against them in a speech which held during two days.”—But the facts are, that Mr. Martin had been a considerable time in convention before he spoke; that when he entered into the debates, he appeared not to need “information,” as he was fully possessed of the subject; and that his speech, if published, would do him great honor. Another assertion of this famous writer, is, that Mr. Gerry in “a sarcastical reply, admired the strength of Mr. Martin’s lungs, and his profound knowledge in the first principles of government;” that “this reply” “left him a prey to the most humiliating reflections; but these did not teach him to bound his future speeches by the lines of moderation; for the very next day he exhibited, without a blush, another specimen of eternal volubility.”—This is so remote from truth, that no such reply was made by Mr. Gerry to Mr. Martin, or to any member of the convention; on the contrary, Mr. Martin, on the first day he spoke, about the time of adjournment, signified to the convention that the heat of the season4 and his indisposition prevented his proceeding, and the house adjourned without further debate, or a reply to Mr. Martin from any member whatever. Again, the Landholder has asserted that Mr. Martin voted “an appeal should lay to the supreme judiciary of the United States for the correction of all errors both in law and fact,” and “agreed to the clause that declares nine States to be sufficient to put the government in motion;” and in a note says, “Mr. Gerry agreed with Mr. Martin on these questions.” Whether there is any truth in these assertions as they relate to Mr. Martin, he can best determine, but as they respect Mr. Gerry, they reverse the facts; for he not only voted against the first proposition (which is not stated by the Landholder, with the accuracy requisite for a writer [1753]on government) but contended for jury trials in civil cases, and declared his opinion, that a federal judiciary with the powers abovementioned, would be as oppressive and dangerous, as the establishment of a Star Chamber.5—And as to the clause that “declares nine States to be sufficient to put die government in motion,” Mr. Gerry was so much opposed to it, as to vote against it, in the first instance, and afterwards to move for a reconsideration of it.6 The Landholder having in a former publication asserted “that Mr. Gerry introduced a motion, respecting the redemption of old continental money,” and the publick having been informed by a paragraph in the Massachusetts Centinel, No. 32 of vol. 8, as well as by the honorable Mr. Martin, that neither Mr. Gerry, or any other member had introduced such a proposition,7 the Landholder now says, that “out of 126 days, Mr. Martin attended only 66,” and then enquires “Whether it is to be presumed, that Mr. Martin could have been minutely informed, of all that happened in convention, and committees of convention, during the sixty days of his absence?” and “Why is it that we do not see Mr. M’Henry’s verification of his assertion, who was of the committee for considering a provision for the debts of the Union?” But if these enquiries were intended for subterfuges, unfortunately for the Landholder, they will not avail him: for, had Mr. Martin not been present at the debates on this subject, the fact is, that Mr. Gerry was not on a committee with Mr. M’Henry,8 or with any other person, for considering a provision for the debts of the union, or any provision that related to the subject of old continental money; neither did he make any proposition, in convention, committee, or on any occasion, to any member of convention or other person, respecting the redemption of such money; and the assertions of the Landholder to the contrary, are altogether destitute of the shadow of truth. The Landholder, addressing Mr. Martin, further says, “Your reply to my second charge against Mr. Gerry, may be soon dismissed: compare his letter to the legislature of his state, with your defence, and you will find, that you have put into his mouth, objections9 different from any thing it contains, so that if your representation be true, his must be false.” The objections referred to. are those mentioned by Mr. Martin, as being made by Mr. Gerry, against the supreme power of Congress over the militia. Mr. Gerry, in his letter to the legislature, states as an objection, “That some of the powers of the federal legislature are ambiguous and others, (meaning the unlimited power of Congress, to keep up a standing army in time of peace, and their entire controul of the militia) are indefinite and dangerous.”10 Against both these did Mr. Gerry warmly contend, and why his representations must be false, if Mr. Martin’s are [1754]true, which particularized what Mr. Gerry’s stated generally, can only be discovered by such a profound reasoner, as the Connecticut Landholder. The vanity of this writer, in supposing that his charges would be the subject of constitutional investigation, can only be equalled by his impertinence, in interferring with the politics of other States, or by his ignorance, in supposing a state convention could take cognizance of such matters as he calls charges, and that Mr. Gerry required a formal defence, or the assistance of his colleagues, to defeat the unprovoked and libellous attacks of the Landholder, or of any other unprincipled reviler.11 The Landholder says, “That Mr. Martin thought the deputy attorney general of the United States, for the state of Maryland, destined for a different character, and that inspired him with the hope, that he might derive from a desperate opposition, what he saw no prospect of gaining by a contrary conduct: but the Landholder ventures to predict, that though Mr. Martin was to double his efforts, he would fail in his object.” By this, we may form some estimate of the patriotism of the Landholder, for, whilst he so readily resolves Mr. Martin’s conduct into a manœuvre for office, he gives too much reason to suppose, that he himself has no idea of any other motive in conducting politicks. But how can the Landholder ascertain, that “Mr. Martin thought” the office mentioned “destined for a different character?” Was the Landholder present at the distination?” if so, it was natural for him, knowing there was a combination against Mr. Martin, (however remote this gentleman was from discovering it) to suppose his accidental opposition to the complotters, proceeded from a discovery of the plot.—Surely, the Landholder must have some reason for his conjecture respecting the motives of Mr. Martin’s conduct, or be subject to the charge of publishing calumny, knowing it to be such. If then, this great Statesman was in a secret, which has been long impenetrable, he is now entitled to the honor of giving the public the most important information they have received, concerning, the origin of the new constitution: and having candidly informed them who is not, he ought to inform who is to fill that office, and all others of the new federal government.—It may then, in some measure be ascertained, what individuals have supported the constitution on principles of patriotism, and who under this guise have been only squabbling for office. Perhaps we shall find, that the Landholder is to have the contract for supplying the standing army under the new government, and that many others, who have recurred to abuse on this occasion, have some such happy prospects: indeed the Landholder puts it beyond doubt, if we can believe him, that it was determined in the privy council of the federal convention, that however Mr. Martin might advocate the new constitution, he should not have the office mentioned: for if this was not the case, [1755]how can the Landholder so roundly assert, that Mr. Martin could have “no prospect by a contrary conduct of gaining the office, and so remarkably sanguine is the Landholder, that the members of the privy council would be senators of the new Congress, in which case the elections, would undoubtedly be made according to the conventional list of nominations, as that he ventures to predict, tho’ Mr. Martin was to double his efforts, he would fail in his object.” Thus, whilst this blazing star of federalism is taking great pains to hold up Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason, as having held private meetings, “to aggrandize Old Massachusetts, and the ancient Dominion,” he has confessed enough to shew that his private meetings were solely to aggrandize himself."
Letter,No,Nathan Dane,Samuel Adams,,,5/10/1788,"Yesterday were sent to me inclosed–the inclosed pamphlet and printed letter, with a request to convey them to you, which I do myself the honor to transmit accordingly2–So far as my information extends the sentiments expressed by this writer, very generally meet the approbation of those who aim at Just and uncorrupt Government on republican principles–nor do I perceive any thing in this publication in the least inconsistent with the determination of the Massa. Convention3—a determination, in my opinion, by far the wisest & best that has been made on the Subject–for tho the situation of the Country made it prudent to adopt the Constitution, and put it into operation; yet, clear I am, that we ought not to relax a moment in our attention and vigilance for further guarding and checking the exercise of powers given by the Constitution, and for securing the liberties of America, and an honest administration of Government on known and certain principles–My fears and apprehensions do not arise altogether from a consideration of the faults in the new Constitution; but, in a considerable measure, from a full persuasion that we have many men, and able ones too, in this Country who have a disposition to make a bad use of any government; and who, if not well checked and restrained by the forms of the Government, will, so far as they can have influence produce a wicked and corrupt administration–and you may, Sir, be assured that the Zealous advocates for the adoption of this Constitution, and who are pretty numerous, artful and active, do not intend that any amendments shall be adopted, even after the Constitution shall be put into operation, if they can any way prevent it–at least they will oppose all amendments which, I believe, the republican and honest part of the Community will contend for–however, I think the true Federalists, or [1094]true friends of a genuine federal republic, are extending their influence and connections very considerably; and tho a large proportion of them considering our situation agree to adopt the system as presented, they are determined with candor and firmness, to endeavour to establish in these States governments on principles of freedom and equality–whether the friends of honest measures–or the friends of influence and corruption will succeed time only can determine–Sure I am, the former will have the support and advice of your Self and many others who have Steered the political Ship through the late Storm– Eight States have now determined relative to the Constitution proposed4–I can give you no certain information respecting the other five–our accounts respecting the Sentiments of the men elected for the State Conventions are various–but, on the whole, I am inclined to believe they will adopt with recommending amendments as in Massa.–in this State Virga. & N.C. the numbers for and agt. are pretty equal, as well as abilities–Your friend Mr. Lee I understand, declined going to the State Convention, principally, on account of the unhealthiness of the place where the Convention is to meet5— I mentioned to you in my last the application of Kentucky for an admission into the union6–I am just informed a gentleman has arrived in this place from Vermont, to make enquiries, &c respecting her admission into the union I understand the State has appointed a Committee and given them power to apply to Congress whenever they shall see a fair opportunity for again bringing under consideration the independance and admission of that State into the union7–I have been wishing for sometime that this Subject might again be brought into view–for I am well persuaded if these States do no[t] unite in their infancy, and cement the union, they will not do it hereafter–"

Newspaper,No,Phileleutheros,,Hampshire Gazette,,5/21/1788,"Quid miseros toties in aperta Pericula Gives, prosius.  Virgil.17 I have somewhat to say in regard to a piece under the signature of Philanthrop, inserted in the Hampshire Gazette of April 23, intended as a an answer to the three gentlemen, who have lately published their reasons of dissent from the Federal Constitution—Herein I shall study brevity. It would seem Philanthrop had been for some time in hard labour, and for all that appears to the contrary, his travail is likely to continue; for it seems he has not yet brought forth; and from his complaints, there is no prospect of a speedy delivery; and therefore, according to the common course of things, his dissolution must soon ensue, unless some skilful operator should step in and facilitate the birth. But to drop the metaphor—Philanthrop seems to be perplexed, not being able to spy out the cause of the publication of those three gentlemen. And it would seem, he has been as hard put to it to obviate their objections, as to investigate their designs. It matters not, that I know of, to Philanthrop, what their intention was. It is evident (if we take his own words for it) that he is by no means assured they had a bad one; for says he, “I am at a loss to conjecture what motives occasioned their publication.” Therefore one would think that candour, he recommends to the gentlemen, would have induced him to suppose they had nothing very atrocious in view. In considering this piece, I shall (setting a side sophistry) do pretty much as Philanthrop has done, in animadverting upon the objections. I shall not confine myself to order—I think he did not—and if it should so happen, I find any thing I cannot confute, I shall follow his example and say nothing about it. He says, “he hopes if charity obliges them to bless the negroes, it will not lead them to curse the Convention”—this is evidently intended as a sarcasm upon the gentlemen, for vindicating the injured rights of the Africans. Why is it thus? Is it because their colour is not so fashionable in this country as in Africa? Or that their features are not supposed [1747]to be so beautifully arranged as those of the Americans, and therefore not to be treated with that humanity which it is generally thought belongs to white people? Or does Philanthrop suppose, with some scoffers at sacred history, that those Africans did not proceed from the loins of the same parent with himself, and so on that score to be treated like brutes? He seems to charge them with cursing the Convention, only because they said that body voted for those barbarities which are exercised towards the Africans. Does this amount to a curse? can rehersing a plain matter of fact, concerning any man or body of men, by good logic, be construed into a curse? Did not the Convention vote, that the Congress should not have it in their power to prohibit the slave-trade until the year eighteen hundred and eight? Were they not sensible, therefore, that this trade would be carried on, with all those barbarities annexed to it? Did they not very generally confess that it was a most wicked piece of business? Where then is the great crime in saying such barbarities were voted for? If it is so, let Philanthrop point out the criminality of it, and no doubt he will obtain credence. If he make a charge he ought certainly to adduce some proof to support it. He must be possessed of some entirely new constructed spy-glass, else he never could have spied out curses where there were none. As little ground had he to dream, from any which dropped from the gentlemen, that they had a desire to return back to Great-Britain, as he had to tax them with cursing the Convention. Two constitutions were offered to the people of Massachusetts before one could obtain.18 18 Must we infer from thence, that those who opposed the first, did it with a view of becoming subject to Great-Britain! Let him answer, if he please. I wish, seeing Philanthrop thought fit to take the matter up, that he had made use of less false reasoning—I will give an instance of it. He says, “While under Great-Britain, we heard nothing from the gentlemen, because that nation more than any under heaven, carried on that trade:” and “that whenever a neighbour had imported a slave, their duty was either to drive him out of the country or to quit it themselves.” It would not, one would think, require a degree of discernment far beyond mediocrity, to discover the falacy of this argument. Will the gentleman pretend there is no difference between a man’s being born under a government, in the framing of which, consequently he could have no hand, and in making one himself? If a man in a state of nature assists in forming a constitution, which gives countenance to iniquity and all kinds of cruelty, does he not by his own act incur guilt to his conscience? But if he is born under such a government, where is the guilt? Neither hath he any right to take upon himself the office of an [1748]executioner, and so undertake to punish those who are guilty, as Philanthrop would suppose—all he can have any right to is to remonstrate and exhort. He indeed may share in the calamities which may fall upon the community in consequence thereof; but he has this consolation, that those calamities are not derived through his means, and therefore he cannot share in the guilt. When a man is called to establish a frame of government, it ought to be such an one as his conscience will justify, or he must give his voice against it. I must say the whole Philanthrop has said on this subject is falacious, from the foundation to the top-stone. His first position seems calculated to deceive the people, whether designedly or not, I do not say—the purport of which is evidently this, that by civil connections people cannot become partakers of each others sins. What is the import of “civil connections?” Let them import what they will, it is evident Philanthrop would have us think, that in establishing this constitution, we have no more connection in the wickedness which the southern states may commit, with our hearty and free consent and engagements to support them in, than we should be with any one nation under heaven in their inequities, provided we had connected with them for the sake of their trade, &c. But these are not parallel—I wish Philanthrop had ingenuity enough to confess it. It is idle for him to pretend, that establishing this constitution is no more than barely establishing certain civil connections with the southern states; was this the case I would agree with him. I am sensible America may enter into a treaty and connect with Spain for certain purposes, and still not become partakers in the iniquity of the inquisition. But if America and Spain were about to form themselves into one politic national body, and America should in that case pledge to Spain their lives and fortunes for the support of the inquisition, ((a) cousin german, to the slave-trade) I should certainly suppose, upon good grounds, they would become partakers of the sin, connected with the inquisition. But lest I should be too lengthy, I shall wave what I have to say further upon Philanthrop’s piece, until another opportunity, only adding my wish, that if he writes again, his sentiments may better agree with his signature.

Newspaper,No,Phileleutheros,,Hampshire Gazette,,6/4/1788,"Quid miseros Mies in aperta pericula cives prosicis?  Virgil.19 I have but a word to say at this time to Philanthrop—It would seem by his discourse that he would not be thought a friend to the cruelties [1749]exercised in carrying on the Slave-Trade—but yet rather than lose his darling constitution, he would have that trade carried on—Here I am reminded of some conversation to which I was lately a witness. A gentleman lately conversing upon this matter said he disliked [the?] Slave-Trade, but he would not have the Constitution set aside on that account—he was asked the question whether, if he had a son a slave in Georgia, he would not overset the Constitution if he could? his reply was “Indeed I would”—This I doubt not is the case with Philanthrop, and every other advocate of the Constitution—I could wish him to reconcile this with humanity—perhaps Philanthrop wishes to reap the benefits arising from the Slave-Trade and let the southern States bear the iniquity—I once heard of a certain man who sent a horse to market by his neighbour—the horse was sold and the returns made, which were so much more than the owner expected or thought he was worth, he had doubt upon his mind whether he ought to receive the whole proceeds—he called a council of neighbours to determine the matter—the result upon the whole was, seeing the horse was sold and the pay made, he who sent him to market should keep the amount for which he was sold—and he who sold him, should bear all the sin—this is the only way I can conceive of, for Philanthrop to get out—and a pretty miserable get out too, if I rightly judge of the matter—If we cannot connect with the southern states without giving countenance to blood and carnage, and all kinds of fraud and injustice, I say let them go—Often do we see unhappy convicts led forth to execution for only taking the property of another—The Congress by the new Constitution are to make laws for the punishment of piracy and murder upon the high seas—But all this seems only to respect white people—the Africans may be pirated, hacked and tortured, and all with impunity. The killing a negroe in the southern states is no more accounted of, than the killing a dog—this is a fact. “Is there not?[”] sure there is, “some chosen curse, “Some hidden thunder in the stores of heaven, “Red with uncommon wrath, to blast the men.” “Who sport with lives and drain out human blood.20"
Newspaper,No,An Antifederalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,6/18/1788,"Mr. Russell, In looking over your Centinel of last Saturday, I observed an “Advertisement extra.” directed to the antifederalists,1 as they are called. I have long wished to see this foolish distinction, which operates only as a bone of contention, or root of bitterness, obliterated and forgotten. In a free republican government, where, as the worthy Dr. Price justly observes, “The people are not subjects, but confederates; and the rulers are not masters, but servants,”2 it appears to me, that when any question with respect to government, is a matter of publick, or political disquisition, that each free-born citizen ought to come forward, with that freedom of speech, with that plainness, openness and candour, which is (I had almost said) peculiar to republicans; and project their scheems, offer their plans, or propose their systems, alterations, additions, or amendments, or whatever they think proper, so long as the great question is in agitation; but whenever it has been fully discussed, candidly heard and debated, and finally determined upon, by a MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, every disputant upon the subject whether an objector or a projector, ought to dispossess himself of all prepossession in favour of his own particular system, and freely and chearfully subscribe to the grand ultimatum, the vox populi: and upon this principle, and no other, can we ever be a free, a happy, and an independent people, under any government whatever. Were we even to have a perfect, system ushered into the world from the thunders of Mount Sinai, so long as we are rangling among ourselves and bickering at one another, we shall forever remain a contemptible and an unhappy people. Let us now examine the mighty difference between what is vulgarly called a federalist and an antifederalist. Is it like the difference between a whig and a tory—the one striving to establish British, and the other a republican government? Certainly not. I take it we are all aiming at one and the same thing; and the only difference seems to be this, the one was for swallowing down the new Constitution as it was: The other was is for trying at least, to make it a little better; and the difference in opinion with respect to the expediency or inexpediency of making the attempt, seems to constitute the essential difference between them. What a mighty bubble—sufficient to split the nation into parties, fill the world full of yeas and nays, and form prejudices which will be the work of an age to remove. I think it is allowed by all parties that the antifederalists when they found themselves in the minority conducted with a great deal of moderation and candour, as they almost unanimously agreed to return home and endeavour to satisfy and unite the people, in order to give fair play to the new Constitution; and for that purpose even suppressed the publication of their objections to it, drawn up by way of protest. And I think it was conceded to be the opinion of those in the majority, that had they have been in the minority, they should not have exhibited the magnanimity, which the then minority did upon the occasion. The truth as I conceive, is, that we are all aiming at one and the same object; and are now nearly united in the means of obtaining that object: Why then should we encourage, or give countenance to any thing which does not tend to enlighten or unite us, but rather to prejudice and divide us? For my own part, I freely confess, that I have had my doubts and fears respecting the new Constitution; and I still have those doubts and fears; and am not in the least disconcerted at being called an antifederalist; nor are my own personal feelings in the least injured at any little puns, or squibs, which are very often flung out against them as such; though at the same time, I am fully convinced that any thing of the kind which seems calculated to prejudice the mind, serves only to keep up a party spirit, and has a very unhappy effect upon the great body of the people. I therefore most ardently hope, that we shall in future, for the grand and laudable purpose of uniting the interests and affections of the people, carefully avoid every thing which looks like party; and all chearfully unite in the great object of making a fair experiment of the NEW CONSTITUTION! (With deference to the opinion of our correspondent, we humbly conceive that has sentiments and his signature do not agree.—An antifederalist is an enemy to a federal government.—A person may be an anti-constitutionalist, [1763]and yet be a federalist.—The lashes hinted at, are given to those who are lovers of anarchy and confusion—who are really antifederalists—not those who have “doubts and fears” respecting the Constitution.)"
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,6/26/1788,"“There seems to be a general infatuation here among the magi; the vulgar have caught it, so that there is no reasoning with them on the subject, though of the greatest importance. Ask any of them, high or low, whether they have any ill apprehensions from the adoption of the new system, they answer, without hesitation, yes; but they say, Congress will certainly make the proposed alterations. Ministers, lawyers, and merchants, made a large proportion of our convention, so that it is no great wonder that the people at large are so many of them deluded; yet, I believe, could the voice of the people in general be taken, a very large majority would be found in opposition to the proposed plan. Of this I am convinced from the frequent conversations I have had with farmers, &c.”"
Letter,Yes,Elbridge Gerry,James Warren,,,6/28/1788,"The convention of New-York will, I am well informed, annex a bill of rights to a conditional ratification, which will remove all our objections, and it is believed Virginia will do the same. Patrick Henry has been brilliant in that convention, and very severe on—2 who is reprobated for his duplicity and versatility. I know not what judgment to form with respect to the final event, but trust in Providence for protection from the thraldom, which may be apprehended, unless the new constitution shall be modified and amended.…"
Letter,No,Nathan Dane,Melancton Smith,,,7/3/1788,"In my last letter2 I briefly gave my opinion on the questions you Stated to me,—now being more at leisure & Sensible that the peculiar Situation of our Government at this time is a matter of common concern and highly interesting to us all; and that we have the Same object in view, the peaceable establishment of a general Government on genuine federal and republican principles, I shall in this be more particular, and submit to your consideration several observations with that candor and frankness with which we have always communicated our sentiments to each other relative to the important subject in question— The Constitution of the United States is now established by the people of ten States, and a day of course must soon be fixed, when all proceedings under the Confederation shall cease—The line of conduct which shall now be pursued by the three States which have not as yet ratified is become particularly and deeply interesting to them and to the whole Confederacy—As things are now circumstanced will it not be clearly for their interest and happiness, as well as for the interest and happiness of all the union to adopt the Constitution proposing such amendments as they may think essential—the Situation of the States is now critical—as the Constitution is already established there can be no previous amendments; and a State which has not ratified, and wishes to be in the union, appears to have but this alternative before her;—either to accede with recommending certain alterations, or to make them a condition of her Accession; and the probable consequence of either Step must be considered—I take it for granted that New York and the other two States wish to form a part of an American Confederacy—the readiness with which they Joined in the revolution, and acceded to the articles of Confederation; their open and general professions, and their past exertions to the support of the union Justify the idea opinion—In all our late political discussions, a Separation of the States, or Separate Confederacies, have Scarcely, to my knowledge, [1255]been Seriously mentioned—Admitting that Rhode Island, New York, and North Carolina all withhold their assent to the Constitution, and propose similar amendments, their situation is such, far removed from each other, and surrounded by ratifying States, that they never can think of confederating among themselves—Each one of them must be considered as Standing alone—but we have no reason to suppose that any one of those States has a wish to Stand alone, in Case she can Confederate on principles agreeable to her—If I understand the politics of these three States, they are strongly attached to governments founded in freedom and compact, and possess a Just aversion to those which are the result of force and violance—they will, therefore, be the last States which will adopt measures tending to foment parties, and give passion an ascendancy over reason, or to hazard Steps that may, in the end, lead to a civil war, and consequently to the Government of the prevailing party established by the longest Sword—It is not to be pretended that the ratifying States will have any Just cause to make war upon any non ratifying State, merely because she does not accede to a national compact, where she has a right to act according to her discretion—nor ought we to presume that hostilities will be commenced by any party without some plausible or Just provocation—But the ratifying and non ratifying States will immediately have opposite Interests, which, in the nature of things, they will pursue—the longer they shall remain Separate the more their affections and friendship for each other will decrease—and counteracting laws and a disposition for coersive measures will take place—the affairs of the Country will have a propensity to hostilities, extremities and a thousand accidents may give rise to hostilities—The question in the ratifying States being Settled, it is probable the parties in them will gradually unite—In the States where the question shall remain unsettled, and the contest continue between the parties in them, as it undoubtedly will, in what manner they shall Join the union, they will grow more hostile to each other; and from what appears to be their present temper and situation, and if we reason from experience and from the character of men we must conclude, it is at least highly probable, that they will have recourse to arms, or to contentions extremely injurious to their common Interest, at no very distant period And what must be the issue of force, or of such contentions between the parties in any State is not difficult to foresee—If the other States should not interfere, those parties must decide their contest by themselves—If the party called federal shall prevail, they bring the State into the union unconditionally, or establish a State Government of their own, probably, on their own principles—If the other party shall prevail they will keep the State out of the union, unless the federal [1256]Constitution, which can hardly be presumed, shall in the mean time be made agreeable to them, and they will of necessity add a degree of severity to their laws and measures very incompatible with those principles of freedom they now contend for—this presents a disagreeable Scene in either event—But should the other States interfere, or a civil war by any accident become general between the advocates and opposers of the Constitution, throughout the United States, which is the probable consequence of any hostile beginnings, what must be the issue? our people tho enlightened are high Spirited—one party, when both are nearly ruined, may prevail, not in accommodating and fixing a government in freedom and compact, but in force and violance,—and may we not expect a more severe high toned partial system established to secure the victorious party, at least a system more despotic than the old one we lay aside, or the one we are adopting—Were there any great number of men heart[i]ly attached to the Confederation, their success might establish it—but this in its present form seems to have but few or no advocates—Were there any great number of men attached to it with certain defined alterations in it, their success might establish it when so altered—but we have not agreed in those alterations—and if we may Judge from experience, and what appears to be the public opinion, it is more difficult to mould the Confederation to the wishes of the people than the Constitution—the Community in fact consists of two parties, the advocates, who are for establishing the Constitution in its present form, and the opposers, who generally if I understand them consider it as a tolerable basis, but as an imperfect and unguarded system unless amended—Were the advocates well attached to the system their success might establish it but this is not the Case—we know that many of them and those too, who would have the most influence, from their abilities, address, and activity, in producing a Government, never will agree to a system so favourable to liberty and republicanism even as the one proposed, if by any means they can get one more favourable to themselves, and unfavourable to the body of the people—If the other party those who wish to have the system but amended, succeed, and they were agreed in the amendments their success might establish the plan so amended—but no set of amendments have been agreed upon, and different ones have been proposed by different Conventions—You will, therefore, I am confident, agree with me that the friends of liberty and of Governments founded in compact cannot reasonably expect any good consequences from force and violance—the very means are hostile to the end proposed—Our object is to improve the plan proposed: to Strengthen and secure its democratic features; to add checks and guards to it; to secure equal liberty by [1257]proper Stipulations to prevent any undue exercise of power, and to establish beyond the power of faction to alter, a genuine federal republic to effect this great and desirable object the peace of the Country must be preserved, candor cherished, information extended and the doors of accommodation constantly kept open—the votes of the people will I think avail them much more in establishing a government favourable to them—than any violent or forceable proceedings—It is to be considered that five States have adopted the Constitution without proposing any amendments—we have seen the amendments proposed in the Conventions of four States—and certain it is there appears to be too little in reality proposed to be gained by the amendments to Justify parties in those States carrying matters to extremities—Nor will any one two, or three States ever expect the others to meet them in amendments, but on the principles of accommodation—whatever amendments any State may propose, I am persuaded you are too well acquainted with men, not to be sensible that passion opinion, and self will must have a constant influence in their conduct relative to them, that when terms are rigidly insisted on by one party, they are generally opposed by terms rigidly insisted on by the other It cannot be proper for any State positively to say to the others, that unless they precisely agree to the alterations she proposes she will not accede to the Union—this would be rather dictating—a State may take a question upon the Constitution simply as it stands and express its sense of it in its present form—she may then annex recommended amendments and adopt it with them, or make them the Condition of her accession to the Union, I flatter myself, after a State has expressed her Sense upon the simple proposition you will prefer the mode of adopting with recommendatory amendments annexed—the new system must soon go into operation and some of the most important laws be made in the first Congress, and essential amendments be recommended by it—the State that adopts this mode comes into the Union armed with the declared Sentiments of her people, and will immediately have a voice in the federal Councils—she there will avail herself of all her influence, and of the advantages of accommodating principles in bringing the other States to accord with her Sentiments—whereas if she adopts conditionally She will not have a voice in those Councils during the most interesting period—party Spirit will, probably, reign in her bosom, and ill will constantly gain ground between her and the other States—and it is in my mind almost an absolute certainty that she must forever remain out of the Union, or relinquish some of her conditions—It cannot be presumed that any two of the three States will precisely agree in the same Alterations, and should they do it, it is not probable that [1258]all the States will agree exactly to them—there are many and able advocates for valuable amendments, and a good system of laws in every State and may they not prevail should all the States meet in the first Congress but should some of them Stand out, and those in which those amendments and laws have the most friends—the federal republicans or men who wish to cement the union of the States on republican principles will be divided, and have but a part of their Strength in Congress where they ought to have the whole—When measures of any sort become necessary in a Community, it is generally wise to take a part in them, and to bring them as near to our opinions as we can in the first instance, and I have ever thought since a federal Convention was agreed on that Rhode Island and certain individuals who were appointed to that Convention, missed it exceedingly in not attending it—they might clearly, had they attended, have engrafted many of the principles and checks they now contend for, into the System—and have given it those features and securities which as it now appears, would meet the approbation of the people in General—they saw a Constitution of some kind was to be made, and before it had taken a fixed direction was the time for exertions—You as well as others know it to be a fact that some parts of the Constitution most complained of, were obtained with much address and after repeated trials, and which never could have been carried had the States and members, I refer to, attended the federal Convention—for any State now to stand out and oppose appears to me to be but a repetition of the same error—I might add many more observations but I think I need not dwell longer on these points—Even when a few states had adopted without any alterations, the ground was materially changed; and now it is totally shifted—tho I retain my opinion respecting the feeble features, the extensive powers, and defective parts of the System, yet circumstanced as we are, I confess, I feel no impropriety in urging the three States to accede—men in all the States who wish to establish a free, equal, and efficient government, to the exclusion of anarchy, corruption, faction, and oppression ought in my opinion to unite in their exertions in making the best of the Constitution now established, to preserve inviolate the liberties of America, and to promote the happiness of the people by Just and equal laws and an equitable administration; to add constitutional security to those liberties on every proper occasion are still the objects of all good men—this now appears to be the way to disappoint those men who discover a disposition to make a bad use of a Constitution in many parts not well guarded, and to use its powers to corrupt and selfish purposes—a good Constitution is capable of affording much security to the rights of the people, and ought to be aimed at with [1259]unremitted attention—But ought we to expect any Constitution under which the people may, with Safety, relax in any considerable degree in their attention to public measures?—can they be secure under any Constitution unless attentive themselves, and unless some of their able leaders are their real freinds and their faithful guardians Tho I think our people have examined the system in question with candor and freedom and discovered a strong attachment to liberty—Yet I would by no means so far rely upon their exertions and vigilance as to lose sight of those Constitutional securities which may be obtained by time and experience—while we veiw the conduct of rulers with candor, we ought to watch their movements with an Eagle’s eye, and guard and secure the temple of freedom with unceasing attention— To conclude ought we not now to give additional weight to the plea in favor of the Constitution drawn from the peculiarity of our situation, and which when less urgent and pressing appears again and again to have saved the system? and tho the system may be abused by bad men, ought we not to recollect that the road to lasting fame in this Country has generally been Justice, and Integrity, prudence and moderation, political information and industry & that there is more than an equal chance that this will continue to be the case? attempts to palm upon our people vice for virtue, the mere shew of talents for real abilities, and the arts and puffs of party for a well earned reputation have generally failed—and what is wanting but to excite the attention of this intelligent people to render such attempts always unsuccessful? all these and many other considerations ought to have their Just weight in deciding the great question before us—"
