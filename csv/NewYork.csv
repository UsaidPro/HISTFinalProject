Newspaper,No,A Republican,,New York Journal,Alexander Hamilton,9/6/1787,"“New ways he must attempt, his grov’ling name To raise aloft, and wing his flight to fame.” Dryden.2 [17 Mr. Greenleaf, In Mr. Child’s Daily Advertiser, of the 21st of July, there appeared certain animadversions, on sentiments said to be expressed by his excellency the governour, respecting the Federal Convention.—On the first impressions made by that extraordinary publication, it was the wish of some of my fellow-citizens, that the governour would have made a reply to it; but, on a little reflection, it became the general opinion, that it would be highly improper, in the first magistrate of a respectable state, to enter the list in a newspaper with an anonymous scribler; and it cannot but afford pleasure to find, that it has accordingly been treated by him with silent and merited contempt. It may not, however, be amiss for a private citizen, who feels himself deeply interested in the honour and welfare of the state, to make a few remarks on that production, and to unmask the motives from which it originated. I think proper to premise, that I have but a slight personal acquaintance with the governour, and by no means such an intimacy, as would lead me to a knowledge of his opinion on public measures; whether he entertains the sentiments which that writer alledges, or, whether he ever delivered them in the manner asserted, I am not able to determine, and therefore shall neither attempt to justify or condemn them: I cannot, however, refrain from observing, that it is very extraordinary, that expressions, said to be used in a public company, and currently reported and believed, should never (as far as I have been able to learn) have reached the ear of a single citizen, before they appeared in the Daily Advertiser. The ostensible design of that writer, is, to obviate any wrong impressions, which the conduct he ascribes to the governor, might make upon the public mind.—Let us then enquire, whether his actions correspond with his professions. It must be admitted, that, to justify the publication, the writer ought to have had the most conclusive evidence, that his excellency had (as is asserted) “in public company, and without reserve,” expressed the sentiments ascribed to him, or, at least that it was “currently reported and generally believed” that he had; because, the only evil that could possibly result, must arise from the promulgation of those sentiments; for if they were not known, they could not influence. If the writer then proceeded on misinformation, he occasioned the very evil which he pretends, he was labouring to prevent. That the writer had no such testimony, will appear from his own words, for after stating the facts, he adds, “upon this conduct of his excellency, if he is not misrepresented, the following reflections will naturally occur to every considerate and impartial man.”—Here he very strongly implies a [18]doubt of the truth of the facts, on which he founds his production, while he admits, at the same time, that there could be no real use in his observations, since they would naturally, and without his suggesting them, have occurred to every “considerate and impartial man;” it must consequently appear, that this rude attack, which, by the author’s own admission, could have no other object but to secure the opinion of the prejudiced and inconsiderate, was not the offspring of patriotism. Lest I should be misunderstood, it is here necessary to observe, that I by no means assent to the reasoning of the writer, admitting it to be inferred from uncontrovertible facts; I deny that it is unwarrantable and culpable, in any citizen of a free state, [(]much less in a man, who is from office, one of the guardians of our liberties) freely and unreservedly to express his sentiments on public measures, however serious the posture of our national affairs may be; on the contrary, it is his essential duty; and the more critical our situation, the more loudly he is called upon to perform it, and to approve or disapprove, as he may think the public good directs. Should ever this inherent right be destroyed, it is easy to foresee, that a tyranny must, sooner or later, be the inevitable consequence.—Every attempt then to call it in question, I consider as high treason against the majesty of the people. In governments, conducted by intrigue and deception, and where ignorance is their chief support, candour will be arraigned as a vice, and reservedness construed into wisdom.—We ought to esteem it one of our greatest blessings, that the administration of our government does not depend upon such shallow and feeble artifices. There is something extremely novel and singular in the manner, the performance under consideration is introduced, which cannot have escaped notice, and which must lead to a discovery of the spirit that dictated it.—It is founded on a report, of the truth of which, the writer himself expresses his doubts: is not this a refinement upon the system of slander? by adopting this new-invented mode of detraction, the reputation of any man, or family, may be wounded; nothing more is necessary than to have a malicious report circulated, which it will be easy to effect, by characters unworthy of notice, and then insert it in a newspaper, with an if it is not a misrepresentation, and deduce the most injurious traductions; and such is the depravity of human nature, that where party-spirit prevails, these productions will be read with pleasure, and command the applause of the malignant mind. It might have been wise in the author, to have reflected, that however elated with his situation, connections and prospects, they do not exempt him from the ungenerous attack. [19] An eminent author has predicted, that the opulent and ambitious, would never rest contented with the equality established by our democratic forms of government. This was the case in the once free states of Athens and of Rome; the wealthy were continually harrassing and injuring the poor;—the eloquent were frequently luring them to destruction, by their pernicious orations. The ambitious were always at work to circumvent, and deprive them of their freedom. And they, unhappy people, were finally plunged into slavery. That this prediction, is already in some measure realized, must be obvious to every man of the least discernment; (it cannot admit of a doubt, that a certain lordly faction exists in this state, composed of men, possessed of an insatiable thirst for dominion, and who, having forfeited the confidence of their fellow-citizens, and being defeated in their hopes of rising into power, have, for sometime past, employed themselves with unremitted industry, to embarrass every public measure; they reprobate our laws, censure our rulers, and decry our government, thereby to induce the necessity of a change, that they may establish a system more favorable to their aristocratic views, in which, honors and distinction shall not depend upon the opinion and suffrages of the people: every drone, every desparate debtor, and every other worthless character, though a despot in principle, even though he has drenched his hands in the blood of his fellow-citizens, that enlist under their banners, are received with applause, and dubbed patriots and federal men: no measure, which low cunning can devise, or wicked exertion effect, is omitted to ensure the attainment of their wishes; every virtuous man, who dares to stand in the way of their ambitious and arbitrary projects, becomes the victim of their keenest resentment, and is devoted to destruction—hence we find our newspapers daily disgraced with calumny, personal scurrility and falsehood)3—and hence we can trace the motives which influenced this writer. I shall conclude with a few lines from the works of the celebrated Churchill, and leave the application to the reader.4 “Smit with the love of honor, or the pence, O’er-run with wit, and destitute of sense, Legions of factious authors throng at once; Fool beckons fool, and dunce awakens dunce. To Hamilton’s the ready lies repair; Ne’er was lie made which was not welcome there. Thence, on maturer judgment’s anvil wrought. The polish’d falsehoods into public brought; [20] Quick circulating slanders mirth afford, And reputation bleeds in ev’ry word.”"
Newspaper,No,An Old Soldier,,Lansingburgh Northern Centinel,,9/10/1787,"Messrs. Printers, That every person who has been any way active in opposing British tyranny, and establishing the freedom, independence, and liberty of the rising EMPIRE of AMERICA,—has secret enemies, I believe is not doubted:—⟨That there are scattered throughout the United States, private emissaries of Britain, in order to sow the seeds of division and discontent among the people, is generally acknowledged:—And Britain has not yet learnt to relinquish their favorite idea [24]of subduing and reducing to abject slavery the free born sons of Columbia; they yet hope, by our folly and want of union among ourselves, to have an opportunity of subjugating us to their tyrannical sway.—A proof of this I observed in your Centinel, No. 16. in an “Impromptu, on reading in a late Centinel of Gov. Clinton’s insurgency and anti-federalism,” wherein the chief magistrate of this state is charged, by some incendiary, with an intention of treason against the United States; consequently to subvert a government he has uniformly, from the commencement of the late war, endeavoured, by every exertion in his power, to establish.—In the most gloomy hours of our warfare, who more readily drew his sword in our defence?—Who was more unwearied in his endeavours to defeat the vain attempts of our enemies to subdue us. Every one who knows his excellency’s character, and is in any way acquainted with his conduct, must be convinced that he has rendered this country great and essential services, both in his civil and military capacities; and I think it the height of ingratitude to villify a character, which ought to be esteemed, and even revered, for his services.—if he is guilty of the charge exhibited in the Centinel, or any other against the people, let the author step forth, as a freeman, and boldly make them good;—if he is guilty by our laws, let him suffer;—if innocent, and still the faithful servant of the public we have ever found him—for God’s sake let us not traduce a character so valuable to us, but by every means in our power, support him in all measures tending to the general good of our country, and let us ever detest those vile incendiaries, who (under British influence) secretly endeavour to sow the seeds of division, discontent and distrust among us.⟩ Confidence in our rulers will make us a great and happy people; a want of it will be our ruin. Our magistrates are not elected for life—we can change them when they act inconsistent with our welfare; but let us weigh and examine well their conduct before we dismiss them, least we repent our change, on proving those who are untried. Lansingborough, Sept. 7, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Rusticus,,New York Journal,,9/13/1787,"Mr. Greenlaf, I cannot but express my indignation at the many illiberal publications, which constantly crowd our newspapers, on the subject of politics. [25 It seems, by these publications, to be highly criminal, especially at this particular period, for any man to differ in opinion from a certain Aristocratic junto, who appear determined, by their writings, to silence, and traduce every person who will not subscribe to every part of their political creed. In a free country, as this is, every man has an indubitable right to think for himself, and to express his approbation or disapprobation of public measures, when ever he supposes them consistent or inconsistent with the interest and happiness of the people. If this is not the case, then have we been fighting for a shadow, and lavishing our blood and treasure to very little purpose. We are frequently informed by this junto, or their adherents, that the present Convention, in Philadelphia, is composed of the wisest and best characters in the United States, and that it is next to high treason to lisp a suspicion, that such a band of patriots can possibly recommend any system, or measure, inconsistent with the liberty, interest, and happiness, of those whom they represent. I am very sensible that there are many such characters in that honorable assembly as these writers have mentioned; but at the same time, it is well known, that there are too many of a very different character; perfect Bashaws! (saving a want of power) who would trample on the most sacred rights of the people, without the least reluctance or remorse; men who are possessed of the highest opinion of their own superlative, excellence, and importance; and who have worked themselves into a belief, that Heaven hath formed the bulk of mankind, to be mere slaves and vassals, to men of their superior genius, birth, and fortune. The greatest part of the publications alluded to, are artfully calculated to prepare the minds of the people, implicitly to receive any form of government that may be offered them. If this is not the design, why anticipate? If the Convention recommend such measures as are not inconsistent with the union, but those that will promote the general interest of the confederation, and secure the essential rights of the people, every good and virtuous citizen will not only subscribe to them, but use all his influence; nay, strain every nerve to carry them into effect. A paragraph has been introduced, as an article of intelligence, into the Daily Advertiser, and the papers published in this city, which was said to have been received from one of the counties in Pennsylvania, asserting, that the good people of that state are ready to receive, and implicitly acquiesce, in any kind of government that may be offered them by the Convention.2—This is paying but a poor compliment indeed, either to their understanding, or patriotism; and although it is [26]asserted with so much confidence, I have too good an opinion of them, and the rest of my fellow-citizens, on the continent, to suppose, that such an enlightened people, who made so many strenuous exertions during the late war, to free themselves from the tyranny of Britain, can possibly be sunk into such a state of supineness, and so regardless of the essential interests of themselves, and their posterity, as to receive any form of government, that will not effectually secure their just rights and privileges, let it be recommended by any man, or, body of men, however wise, learned, or dignified. Queens-County, September 10, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Anti-Defamationis,,New York Journal,,9/20/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf. With great indignation I have observed several publications that have lately appeared, reflecting, in a most illiberal manner, on the Governor of this state, on account of some accidental expressions, concerning the Convention at Philadelphia; particularly one under the signature of Aristides, in the Daily Advertiser, No. 794. [30 For my part, I am not personally acquainted with the Governor, or with Col. Hamilton, and of course cannot be influenced by any undue partiality to either, but I cannot help thinking that the former (even admitting the assertions against him to be strictly true) has been very ill used. I must beg leave to ask Aristides the following questions: 1st. Why should the Governor, or any other man, in a free state, be precluded from the privilege of speaking his sentiments in a matter of general concern? 2d. Why should the Governor, or any other man, be reprobated for differing in sentiment from a majority in Congress, or legislature of the state? It is foreign to my purpose, at this time, to enter into a particular discussion, concerning the propriety of the appointment of the Convention at Philadelphia; but was I fully persuaded that their appointment was ill judged, and that much evil instead of good would result from their deliberations, I should conceive myself highly criminal in not communicating my ideas, although they might differ from the prevailing opinion. The free citizens of this continent will never consent to have a constitution crammed down their throats. They have an undoubted right to examine before they accede, and to deny if they do not approve. Although much is to be expected from the wisdom of the Convention in forming the constitution worthy of being received; it is still to be remembered, that the wisest men have often been guilty of very capital errors, and that, “notwithstanding the various forms of government hitherto recommended to the observance of men, very few are rendered better.[”] If, therefore, our worthy Governor, or any other man, conceives, that by attempting a cure, the malady will be increased, it becomes his duty, as far as in him lies, to stem the tide of congressional, legislatorial, or popular prejudice. But the design of Aristides and his colleague, in thus endeavouring, by unjust stigmas and innuendoes, to cast an odium on our Governor, is too obvious to be concealed. I must tell him plainly, that his trick wont take. The people are not so easily gulled. Let him forward his squibs to a certain northern county, where they may be useful to his friends at some future day; but here, and in other parts of the state, where the people have too much wisdom and spirit to be imposed upon, or browbeaten, they will only serve to bring the author, and his connections, into contempt."
Newspaper,No,Inspector,,New York Journal,Alexander Hamilton,9/20/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, I have in general observed, that the most sensible men are usually modest and reserved, and that a man of consummate impudence, with but a moderate share of understanding, moves in the world with the greatest eclat; but although the world may some times over-rate a shallow capacity, it is often-times undeceived by a man’s vanity leading him a step too far in his ridiculous sallies. A man’s knowledge is frequently over-rated in vulgar estimation in consequence of his having a memory good enough to retain a number of harmonious words which he can retail out at pleasure.—I know a negro who cannot read, and yet can deliver an extempore rhapsody that will captivate weak minds, and give not offence, even to the ears of intelligent men.1 I have also known an upstart attorney, palm himself upon a great and good man, for a youth of extraordinary genius, and under the shadow of such a patronage, make himself at once known and respected; but being sifted and bolted to the brann, he was at length found to be a superficial, self-conceited coxcomb, and was of course turned off, and disregarded by his patron.2 I have known a blockhead publish pamphlets with borrowed phrases and arguments, by which he acquired a reputation he never was entitled to.3 I have also known a man publish pieces of his own composition, [32]which, on examination, I have found to be mere froth, calculated only to bewilder the understanding. I have a son, who is a lad of tolerable capacity, and great shrewdness. This boy, who is about 12 years old, reads the Newspapers to me, every morning; I have taught this young shaver to turn all the frothy publications he meets with, into plain English, and, as a specimen of his improvement, I shall give you his interpretation of a piece which appeared a few days ago in the Daily Advertiser, written in the Creolian taste, by Tom S**t, a mustee, viz.= “Mungo here, Mungo there, Mungo every where, What a terrible life am I led.” Padlock.4 “My dear masters, I am indeed leading a very hard life in your service; you are driving me from post to pillar, without paying me for my trouble, and I could earn ten times as much by working at home. Consider the great sacrifices I have made for you; by birth a subject of his Danish Majesty;5 I quitted my native soil in the Torrid Zone, and called myself a North American for your sakes.—I have since, not only ranted for you, and jockeyed for you, but even vouchsafed to give my august name to Phocion, a patriotic essay, manufactured by W. S. Esquire,6 and sent from England just after the evacuation, under cover to Chrononhotontologos, the king’s printer:7 you have therefore scarcely done me justice, in simply giving me your suffrages, when I stood in need of them, to pave the way for my future agrandizement. I must however remember with gratitude, that when my ambition led me to become an honorary member of the whig Society,8 I was not disappointed. My daddy, who was present to make interest for me, can evidence with how much chearfulness I was voted in. “The important services I have rendered you, deserve much more than you will ever be able to pay me. I shall however be satisfied, with your compliance with one moderate request, which is, that you will be kind enough to discharge your old faithful steward George (who is grown so saucy, as to speak his mind without fearing any body) and put me, or my immaculate daddy, in his place. “I am sorry you oblige me to speak so plainly, but I am constrained to do it, since your contempt and little notice taken of any late anonymous advertisement, convinces me, that you will not take a broad hint.”   TOM S**T. I have not leisure, at present, sir, to animadvert on the above curious performance, but shall conclude with a maxim of a great Philosopher which you will know how to apply. [33] Those actions which are denominated virtuous, have not any absolute and independent, but a relative beauty; and the source from which they derive their lustre, is the intention which guided them: if well intended, whether they produce good, or evil, they are equally virtuous: the producing good or evil are the accidents; the intention to produce good, is the essence of virtue."
Letter,Yes,Elting & Varick,Peter Van Gaasbeek,,,9/25/1787,"… The New Constitution is the Topick of the day and seems aproved of by many.

Letter,Yes,,,Independent Gazetteer,,9/26/1787,"Extract of a letter from a Member of Congress. dated New-York, September 23, 1787. “… There will be some difficulty in getting it adopted in New-York—the government has already discovered strong marks of disapprobation, and its adherents are constantly employed in disseminating opinions unfavorable to its reception—but all their attempts will be unavailing, as the body of the people will clearly view their own interests, as intimately connected with the establishment of this new government.…”"
Newspaper,No,Cato,,New York Journal,,9/27/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York The Convention, who sat at Philadelphia, have at last delivered to Congress that system of general government, which they have declared best calculated to promote your safety and happiness as citizens of the United States. This system, though not handed to you formally by the authority of government, has obtained an introduction through divers channels: and the minds of you all, to whose observation it has come, have no doubt been contemplating it; and alternate joy, hope, or fear have preponderated, as it conformed to, or differed from, your various ideas of just government. Government, to an American, is the science of his political safety—this then is a moment to you the most important—and that in various points—to your reputation as members of a great nation—to your immediate safety, and to that of your posterity. In your private concerns and affairs of life you deliberate with caution, and act with prudence; [60]your public concerns require a caution and prudence, in a ratio, suited to the difference and dignity of the subject. The disposal of your reputation, and of your lives and property, is more momentous than a contract for a farm, or the sale of a bale of goods; in the former, if you are negligent or inattentive, the ambitious and despotic will entrap you in their toils, and bind you with the cord of power from which you, and your posterity, may never be freed; and if the possibility should exist, it carries along with it consequences that will make your community totter to its center: in the latter, it is a mere loss of a little property, which more circumspection, or assiduity, may repair. Without directly engaging as an advocate for this new form of national government, or as an opponent—let me conjure you to consider this a very important crisis of your safety and character—You have already, in common with the rest of your countrymen, the citizens of the other states, given to the world astonishing evidences of your greatness—you have fought under peculiar circumstances, and was successful against a powerful nation on a speculative question—you have established an original compact between you and your governors, a fact heretofore unknown in the formation of the governments of the world—your experience has informed you, that there are defects in the fœderal system, and, to the astonishment of mankind, your legislatures have concerted measures for an alteration, with as much ease as an individual would make a disposition of his ordinary domestic affairs: this alteration now lies before you, for your consideration; but beware how you determine—do not, because you admit that something must be done, adopt any thing—teach the members of that convention, that you are capable of a supervision of their conduct. The same medium that gave you this system, if it is erroneous, while the door is now open, can make amendments, or give you another, if it is required.—Your fate, and that of your posterity, depends on your present conduct—do not give the latter reason to curse you, nor yourselves cause of reprehension; as individuals you are ambitious of leaving behind you a good name, and it is the reflection, that you have done right in this life, that blunts the sharpness of death; the same principles would be a consolation to you, as patriots, in the hour of dissolution, that you would leave to your children a fair political inheritance, untouched by the vultures of power, which you had acquired by an unshaken perseverance in the cause of liberty—but how miserable the alternative—you would deprecate the ruin you had brought on yourselves—be the curse of posterity, and the scorn and scoff of nations. Deliberate, therefore, on this new national government with coolness; analize it with criticism; and reflect on it with candour: if you find [61]that the influence of a powerful few, or the exercise of a standing army, will always he directed and exerted for your welfare alone, and not to the agrandizement of themselves, and that it will secure to you and your posterity happiness at home, and national dignity and respect from abroad, adopt it—if it will not, reject it with indignation—better to be where you are, for the present, than insecure forever afterwards. Turn your eyes to the United Netherlands, at this moment, and view their situation; compare it with what yours May be, under a government substantially similar to theirs.2 Beware of those who wish to influence your passions, and to make you dupes to their resentments and little interests—personal invectives can never persuade, but they always fix prejudices which candor might have removed—those who deal in them have not your happiness at heart. Attach yourselves to measures, not to men. This form of government is handed to you by the recommendations of a man who merits the confidence of the public;3 but you ought to recollect, that the wisest and best of men may err, and their errors, if adopted, May be fatal to the community; therefore, in principles of politics, as well as in religious faith, every man ought to think for himself. Hereafter, when it will be necessary, I shall make such observations, on this new constitution, as will tend to promote your welfare, and be justified by reason and truth. Sept. 26, 1787."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Morning Post,,9/28/1787,"Nothing (says a correspondent) is so essential to the happiness of a people, as the possession of a free government. Without this the most fertile country and the mildest climates, become scenes of misery and desolation; but with it, the most rugged regions of the earth are crowned with cheerfulness and plenty. This is one of those important truths of which all men seem to be sufficiently convinced; and yet very few nations have taken care to secure to themselves the inestimable blessing. In all ages, the bulk of mankind have been consigned to slavery and wretchedness. The reason of this is but too obvious. What concerns all men alike, is too often neglected by all; but the private interest of a few, selfish and ambitious individuals, is pursued with unremitted ardour. The wealthy and powerful combine together to make a property of their fellow citizens; and few governments have ever existed, in which a conspiracy has not been formed against the liberties of the people."

Newspaper,No,Cato,,New York Journal,Caesar,10/11/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. “Remember, O my friends! the lows, the rights. The generous plan of power deliver’d down. By your renown’d Forefathers; So dearly bought, the price of so much blood! O let it never perish in your hands! But piously transmit it to your children.”1 The object of my last address to you was to engage your dispassionate consideration of the new Federal government; to caution you against precipitancy in the adoption of it; to recommend a correction of its errors, if it contained any; to hint to you the danger of an easy perversion of some of its powers; to solicit you to separate yourselves from party, and to be independent of and uninfluenced by any in your principles of politics: and, that address was closed with a promise of future observations on the same subject which should be justified by reason [80]and truth. Here I intended to have rested the introduction, but a writer under the signature of CÆSAR, in Mr. Childs’s paper of the 1st instant, who treats you with passion, insult, and threat[,] has anticipated those observations which would otherwise have remained in silence until a future period. It would be criminal in me to hesitate a moment to appear as your advocate in so interesting a cause, and to resist the influence of such doctrines as this Caesar holds.—I shall take no other cognizance of his remarks on the questionable shape of my future, or the equivocal appearance of my past reflections, than to declare, that in my past I did not mean to be misunderstood (for Caesar himself declares, that it is obviously the language of distrust) and that in my future there will not be the semblance of doubt. But, what is the language of Caesar—he redicules your prerogative, power, and majesty—he talks of this proferred constitution as the tender mercy of a benevolent sovereign to deluded subjects, or, as his tyrant name-sake, of his proferred grace to the virtuous Cato:—he shuts the door of free deliberation and discussion, and declares, that you must receive this government in manner and form as it is proferred—that you cannot revise nor amend it, and lastly, to close the scene, he insinuates, that it will be more healthy for you that the American Fabius2 should be induced to accept of the presidency of this new government than that, in case you do not acquiesce, he should be solicited to command an army to impose it on you. Is not your indignation roused at this absolute, imperious stile?—For what did you open the veins of your citizens and expend their treasure?—For what did you throw off the yoke of Britain and call yourselves independent?—Was it from a disposition fond of change, or to procure new masters?—if those were your motives, you have your reward before you—go,—retire into silent obscurity, and kiss the rod that scourges you—bury the prospects you had in store, that you and your posterity would participate in the blessings of freedom, and the employments of your country—let the rich and insolent alone be your rulers—perhaps you are designed by providence as an emphatic evidence of the mutability of human affairs, to have the shew of happiness only, that your misery may seem the sharper, and if so, you must submit. But, if you had nobler views, and you are not designed by heaven as an example—are you now to be derided and insulted?—is the power of thinking, on the only subject important to you, to be taken away? and if per chance you should happen to dissent from Caesar, are you to have Caesar’s principles crammed down your throats with an army?—God forbid! In democratic republics the people collectively are considered as the sovereign—all legislative, judicial, and executive power, is inherent in and derived from them. As a people, your power and authority have [81]sanctioned and established the present government—your executive, legislative, and judicial acknowledge it by their public acts—you are again solicited to sanction and establish the future one—yet this Caesar mocks your dignity and laughs at the majesty of the people. Caesar, with his usual dogmatism, enquires, if I had talents to throw light on the subject of legislation, why did I not offer them when the Convention was in session?—he is answered in a moment—I thought with him and you, that the wisdom of America, in that Convention, was drawn as it were to a Focus—I placed an unbounded confidence in some of the characters who were members of it, from the services they had rendered their country, without adverting to the ambitious and interested views of others. I was willingly led to expect a model of perfection and security that would have astonished the world. Therefore, to have offered observation, on the subject of legislation, under these impressions, would have discovered no less arrogance than Caesar. The Convention too, when in session, shut their doors to the observations of the community, and their members were under an obligation of secrecy—Nothing transpired—to have suggested remarks on unknown and anticipated principles would have been like a man groping in the dark, and folly in the extreme. I confess, however, I have been disappointed, and Caesar is candid enough to make the same declaration, for he thinks it might have been more perfect. But to call in dispute, at this time, and in the manner Caesar does, the right of free deliberation on this subject, is like a man’s propounding a question to another, and telling him, at the same time, that if he does not answer agreeable to the opinion of the propounder, he will exert force to make him of the same sentiment:—to exemplify this, it will be necessary to give you a short history of the rise and progress of the Convention, and the conduct of congress thereon. The states in Congress suggested, that the articles of confederation had provided for making alterations in the confederation—that there were defects therein, and as a mean to remedy which, a Convention of delegates, appointed by the different states, was resolved expedient to be held for the sole and express purpose of revising it, and reporting to Congress and the different legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as should (when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by the several states) render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government.3 This resolution is sent to the different states, and the legislature of this state, with others, appoint, in conformity thereto, delegates for the purpose, and in the words mentioned in that resolve, as by the resolution of Congress, and the concurrent resolutions of the senate and assembly of this state, subjoined, will appear.4 [82]For the sole and express purpose aforesaid a Convention of delegates is formed at Philadelphia:—what have they done? have they revised the confederation, and has Congress agreed to their report?—neither is the fact.—This Convention have exceeded the authority given to them, and have transmitted to Congress a new political fabric, essentially and fundamentally distinct and different from it, in which the different states do not retain separately their sovereignty and independency, united by a confederated league—but one entire sovereignty—a consolidation of them into one government—in which new provisions and powers are not made and vested in Congress, but in an assembly, senate, and president, who are not known in the articles of confederation.—Congress, without agreeing to, or approving of, this system proferred by the Convention, have sent it to the different legislatures, not for their confirmation, but to submit it to the people; not in conformity to their own resolution, but in conformity to the resolution of the Convention made and provided in that case. Was it then, from the face of the foregoing facts, the intention of Congress, and of this and the other states, that the essence of our present national government should be annihilated, or that it should be retained and only had an increase of substantial necessary power? Congress, sensible of this latter principle, and that the Convention had taken on themselves a power which neither they nor the other states had a right to delegate to them, and that they could not agree to, and approve of this consolidated system, nor the states confirm it—have been silent on its character; and though many have dwelt on their unanimity, it is no less than the unanimity of opinion that it originated in an assumption of power, which your voice alone can sanctify. This new government, therefore, founded in usurpation, is referred to your opinion as the origin of power not heretofore delegated, and, to this end, the exercise of the prerogative of free examination is essentially necessary; and yet you are unhesitatingly to acquiesce, and if you do not, the American Fabius, if we may believe Caesar, is to command an army to impose it. It is not my view to rouse your passions, I only wish to excite you to, and assist you in, a cool and deliberate discussion of the subject, to urge you to behave like sensible freemen. Think, speak, act, and assert your opinions and rights—let the same good sense govern you with respect to the adoption of a future system for the administration of your public affairs that influenced you in the formation of the present.—Hereafter I do not intend to be diverted by either Caesar, or any other—My object is to take up this new form of national government—compare it with the experience and the opinions of the most sensible and approved political authors—and to shew, that its principles, and the exercise of them, will be dangerous to your liberty and happiness."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Morning Post,,10/11/1787,"⟨On the 17th ult. the Federal Convention which met in Philadelphia in May last, adjourned. A correspondent, who has read the proceedings of the Convention at Philadelphia, begs leave to observe, that to him the seeds of Jealousy and Discord appear thickly sown through the whole of them; and indeed, that the very letter from the President of the Convention, introducing their proceedings to Congress, argues the difficulties, notwithstanding all their labours, that their Constitution must encounter, and doubts of its meeting with full approbation.⟩ The following extracts from it he ⟨quotes as⟩ proofs: “It is obviously impracticable in the ⟨fede⟩ral government of the States, to secure all ⟨rights⟩ of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals entering into society, must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present occasion, this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several states as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests. “That it will meet the full and entire approbation of every state is not perhaps to be expected. &c. &c.”2 The above mentioned letter, our correspondent asserts, is sufficient of itself, to stifle this brat in the moment of its birth. Of all governments, the Americans detest a military one the most, and this is so nearly allied to it, and so likely in a short time to become an absolute one, that, they will be very cautious indeed how they adopt it. And it cannot but strike the most cursory observer, in the plan proposed for electing a President, how the military have secured the election of their favourite Chief,3 should such an election take place, which our correspondent supposes never will. Like Friar Bacon, he observes, they have toiled till they are weary, and have now left their servants to watch the [84]BRAZEN HEAD, while they sleep;4 like his it will be laughed at, and, when that Time, that is, (when French Councils are not altogether absolute among them) is past, it will tumble to pieces, and—cætera desunt.5"

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,10/18/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. When the public is called to investigate and decide upon a question in which not only the present members of the community are deeply interested, but upon which the happiness and misery of generations yet unborn is in great measure suspended, the benevolent mind cannot help feeling itself peculiarly interested in the result. In this situation, I trust the feeble efforts of an individual, to lead the minds of the people to a wise and prudent determination, cannot fail of being acceptable to the candid and dispassionate part of the community. Encouraged by this consideration. I have been induced to offer my thoughts upon the present important crisis of our public affairs. Perhaps this country never saw so critical a period in their political concerns. We have felt the feebleness of the ties by which these United States are held together, and the want of sufficient energy in our present confederation, to manage, in some instances, our general concerns. Various expedients have been proposed to remedy these evils, but none have succeeded. At length a Convention of the states has been assembled, they have formed a constitution which will now, probably, be submitted to the people to ratify or reject, who are the fountain of all power, to whom alone it of right belongs to make or unmake constitutions, or forms of government, at their pleasure. The most important question that was ever proposed to your decision, or to the decision of any people under heaven, is before you, and you are to decide upon it by men of your own election, chosen specially for this purpose. If the constitution, offered to your acceptance, be a wise one, calculated to preserve the invaluable blessings of liberty, to secure the inestimable rights of mankind, and promote human happiness, then, if you accept it, you will lay a lasting foundation of happiness for millions yet unborn; generations to come will rise up and call you blessed.2 You may rejoice in the prospects of this vast extended continent becoming filled with freemen, who will assert the dignity of human nature. You may solace yourselves with the idea, that society, in this favoured land, will fast advance to the highest point of perfection; the human mind will expand in knowledge and virtue, and the golden age be, in some measure, realised. But if, on the other hand, this form of government contains principles that will lead to the subversion of liberty—if it tends to establish a despotism, or, what is worse, a tyrannic aristocracy; then, if you adopt it, this only remaining assylum for liberty will be shut up, and posterity will execrate your memory.3 [106] Momentous then is the question you have to determine, and you are called upon by every motive which should influence a noble and virtuous mind, to examine it well, and to make up a wise judgment. It is insisted, indeed, that this constitution must be received, be it ever so imperfect. If it has its defects, it is said, they can be best amended when they are experienced. But remember, when the people once part with power, they can seldom or never resume it again but by force. Many instances can be produced in which the people have voluntarily increased the powers of their rulers; but few, if any, in which rulers have willingly abridged their authority. This is a sufficient reason to induce you to be careful, in the first instance, how you deposit the powers of government. With these few introductory remarks, I shall proceed to a consideration of this constitution. The first question that presents itself on the subject is, whether a confederated government be the best for the United States or not? Or in other words, whether the thirteen United States should be reduced to one great republic, governed by one legislature, and under the direction of one executive and judicial; or whether they should continue thirteen confederated republics, under the direction and controul of a supreme federal head for certain defined national purposes only?4 This enquiry is important, because, although the government reported by the convention does not go to a perfect and entire consolidation, yet it approaches so near to it, that it must, if executed, certainly and infallibly terminate in it. This government is to possess absolute and uncontroulable power, legislative, executive and judicial, with respect to every object to which it extends for by, the last clause of section 8th, article 1st, it is declared “that the Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution, in the government of the United States; or in any department or office thereof.” And by the 6th article, it is declared “that this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and the treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution, or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” It appears from these articles that there is no need of any intervention of the state governments, between the Congress and the people, to execute any one power vested in the general government, and that the constitution and laws of every state are nullified and declared void, so far as they are or shall be [107]inconsistent with this constitution, or the laws made in pursuance of it, or with treaties made under the authority of the United States.—The government then, so far as it extends, is a complete one, and not a confederation. It is as much one complete government as that of New-York or Massachusetts, has as absolute and perfect powers to make and execute all laws, to appoint officers, institute courts, declare offences, and annex penalties, with respect to every object to which it extends, as any other in the world. So far therefore as its powers reach, all ideas of confederation are given up and lost. It is true this government is limited to certain objects, or to speak more properly, some small degree of power is still left to the states, but a little attention to the powers vested in the general government, will convince every candid man, that if it is capable of being executed, all that is reserved for the individual states must very soon be annihilated, except so far as they are barely necessary to the organization of the general government. The powers of the general legislature extend to every case that is of the least importance—there is nothing valuable to human nature, nothing dear to freemen, but what is within its power. It has authority to make laws which will affect the lives, the liberty, and property of every man in the United States; nor can the constitution or laws of any state, in any way prevent or impede the full and complete execution of every power given. The legislative power is competent to lay taxes, duties, imposts, and excises;—there is no limitation to this power, unless it be said that the clause which directs the use to which those taxes, and duties shall be applied, may be said to be a limitation: but this is no restriction of the power at all, for by this clause they are to be applied to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but the legislature have authority to contract debts at their discretion; they are the sole judges of what is necessary to provide for the common defence, and they only are to determine what is for the general welfare: this power therefore is neither more nor less, than a power to lay and collect taxes, imposts, and excises, at their pleasure; not only the power to lay taxes unlimited, as to the amount they may require, but it is perfect and absolute to raise them in any mode they please. No state legislature, or any power in the state governments, have any more to do in carrying this into effect, than the authority of one state has to do with that of another. In the business therefore of laying and collecting taxes, the idea of confederation is totally lost, and that of one entire republic is embraced. It is proper here to remark, that the authority to lay and collect taxes is the most important of any power that can be granted; it connects with it almost all other powers, or at least will in process of time draw all other after it; it is the great mean [108]of protection, security, and defence, in a good government, and the great engine of oppression and tyranny in a bad one. This cannot fail of being the case, if we consider the contracted limits which are set by this constitution, to the late governments, on this article of raising money. No state can emit paper money—lay any duties, or imposts, on imports, or exports, but by consent of the Congress; and then the net produce shall be for the benefit of the United States: the only mean therefore left, for any state to support its government and discharge its debts, is by direct taxation; and the United States have also power to lay and collect taxes, in any way they please. Every one who has thought on the subject, must be convinced that but small sums of money can be collected in any country, by direct taxes, when the federal government begins to exercise the right of taxation in all its parts, the legislatures of the several states will find it impossible to raise monies to support their governments. Without money they cannot be supported, and they must dwindle away, and, as before observed, their powers absorbed in that of the general government. It might be here shewn, that the power in the federal legislative, to raise and support armies at pleasure, as well in peace as in war, and their controul over the militia, tend, not only to a consolidation of the government, but the destruction of liberty.—I shall not, however, dwell upon these, as a few observations upon the judicial power of this government, in addition to the preceding, will fully evince the truth of the position. The judicial power of the United States is to be vested in a supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The powers of these courts are very extensive; their jurisdiction comprehends all civil causes, except such as arise between citizens of the same state; and it extends to all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution. One inferior court must be established, I presume, in each state, at least, with the necessary executive officers appendant thereto. It is easy to see, that in the common course of things, these courts will eclipse the dignity, and take away from the respectability, of the state courts. These courts will be, in themselves, totally independent of the states, deriving their authority from the United States, and receiving from them fixed salaries; and in the course of human events it is to be expected, that they will swallow up all the powers of the courts in the respective states. How far the clause in the 8th section of the 1st article may operate to do away all idea of confederated states, and to effect an entire consolidation of the whole into one general government, it is impossible to say. The powers given by this article are very general and comprehensive, [109]and it may receive a construction to justify the passing almost any law. A power to make all laws, which shall be necessary and proper, for carrying into execution, all powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, is a power very comprehensive and definite, and may, for ought I know, be exercised in such manner as entirely to abolish the state legislatures. Suppose the legislature of a state should pass a law to raise money to support their government and pay the state debt, may the Congress repeal this law, because it may prevent the collection of a tax which they may think proper and necessary to lay, to provide for the general welfare of the United States? For all laws made, in pursuance of this constitution, are the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of the different states to the contrary notwithstanding.—By such a law, the government of a particular state might be overturned at one stroke, and thereby be deprived of every means of its support. It is not meant, by stating this case, to insinuate that the constitution would warrant a law of this kind; or unnecessarily to alarm the fears of the people, by suggesting, that the federal legislature would be more likely to pass the limits assigned them by the constitution, than that of an individual state, further than they are less responsible to the people. But what is meant is, that the legislature of the United States are vested with the great and uncontroulable powers, of laying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; of regulating trade, raising and supporting armies, organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, instituting courts, and other general powers. And are by this clause invested with the power of making all laws, proper and necessary, for carrying all these into execution; and they may so exercise this power as entirely to annihilate all the state governments, and reduce this country to one single government. And if they may do it, it is pretty certain they will; for it will be found that the power retained by individual states, small as it is, will be a clog upon the wheels of the government of the United States; the latter therefore will be naturally inclined to remove it out of the way. Besides, it is a truth confirmed by the unerring experience of ages, that every man, and every body of men, invested with power, are ever disposed to increase it, and to acquire a superiority over every thing that stands in their way. This disposition, which is implanted in human nature, will operate in the federal legislature to lessen and ultimately to subvert the state authority, and having such advantages, will most certainly succeed, if the federal government succeeds at all. It must be very evident then, that what this constitution wants of being a complete consolidation of the several parts of the union into one complete [110]government, possessed of perfect legislative, judicial, and executive powers, to all intents and purposes, it will necessarily acquire in its exercise and operation. Let us now proceed to enquire, as I at first proposed, whether it be best the thirteen United States should be reduced to one great republic, or not? It is here taken for granted, that all agree in this, that whatever government we adopt, it ought to be a free one; that it should be so framed as to secure the liberty of the citizens of America, and such an one as to admit of a full, fair, and equal representation of the people. The question then will be, whether a government thus constituted, and founded on such principles, is practicable, and can be exercised over the whole United States, reduced into one state? If respect is to be paid to the opinion of the greatest and wisest men who have ever thought or wrote on the science of government, we shall be constrained to conclude, that a free republic cannot succeed over a country of such immense extent, containing such a number of inhabitants, and these encreasing in such rapid progression as that of the whole United States. Among the many illustrious authorities which might be produced to this point, I shall content myself with quoting only two. The one is the baron de Montesquieu, spirit of laws, chap. xvi. vol. 1. “It is natural to a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist. In a large republic there are men of large fortunes, and consequently of less moderation; there are trusts too great to be placed in any single subject; he has interest of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy, great and glorious, by oppressing his fellow citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country. In a large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents. In a small one, the interest of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses are of less extent, and of course are less protected.”5 Of the same opinion is the marquis Beccarari.6 History furnishes no example of a free republic, any thing like the extent of the United States. The Grecian republics were of small extent; so also was that of the Romans. Both of these, it is true, in process of time, extended their conquests over large territories of country; and the consequence was, that their governments were changed from that of free governments to those of the most tyrannical that ever existed in the world. Not only the opinion of the greatest men, and the experience of mankind, are against the idea of an extensive republic, but a variety of reasons may be drawn from the reason and nature of things, against it. [111]In every government, the will of the sovereign is the law. In despotic governments, the supreme authority being lodged in one, his will is law, and can be as easily expressed to a large extensive territory as to a small one. In a pure democracy the people are the sovereign, and their will is declared by themselves; for this purpose they must all come together to deliberate, and decide. This kind of government cannot be exercised, therefore, over a country of any considerable extent; it must be confined to a single city, or at least limited to such bounds as that the people can conveniently assemble, be able to debate, understand the subject submitted to them, and declare their opinion concerning it. In a free republic, although all laws are derived from the consent of the people, yet the people do not declare their consent by themselves in person, but by representatives, chosen by them, who are supposed to know the minds of their constituents, and to be possessed of integrity to declare this mind. In every free government, the people must give their assent to the laws by which they are governed. This is the true criterion between a free government and an arbitrary one. The former are ruled by the will of the whole, expressed in any manner they may agree upon; the latter by the will of one, or a few. If the people are to give their assent to the laws, by persons chosen and appointed by them, the manner of the choice and the number chosen, must be such, as to possess, be disposed, and consequently qualified to declare the sentiments of the people; for if they do not know, or are not disposed to speak the sentiments of the people, the people do not govern, but the sovereignty is in a few. Now, in a large extended country, it is impossible to have a representation, possessing the sentiments, and of integrity, to declare the minds of the people, without having it so numerous and unwieldly, as to be subject in great measure to the inconveniency of a democratic government. The territory of the United States is of vast extent; it now contains near three millions of souls, and is capable of containing much more than ten times that number. Is it practicable for a country, so large and so numerous as they will soon become, to elect a representation, that will speak their sentiments, without their becoming so numerous as to be incapable of transacting public business? It certainly is not. In a republic, the manners, sentiments, and interests of the people should be similar. If this be not the case, there will be a constant clashing of opinions; and the representatives of one part will be continually striving against those of the other. This will retard the operations of government, and prevent such conclusions as will promote the public good. If we apply this remark to the condition of the United States, we [112]shall be convinced that it forbids that we should be one government. The United States includes a variety of climates. The productions of the different parts of the union are very variant, and their interests, of consequence, diverse. Their manners and habits differ as much as their climates and productions; and their sentiments are by no means coincident. The laws and customs of the several states are, in many respects, very diverse, and in some opposite; each would be in favor of its own interests and customs, and, of consequence, a legislature, formed of representatives from the respective parts, would not only be too numerous to act with any care or decision, but would be composed of such heterogenous and discordant principles, as would constantly be contending with each other. The laws cannot be executed in a republic, of an extent equal to that of the United States, with promptitude. The magistrates in every government must be supported in the execution of the laws, either by an armed force, maintained at the public expence for that purpose; or by the people turning out to aid the magistrate upon his command, in case of resistance. In despotic governments, as well as in all the monarchies of Europe, standing armies are kept up to execute the commands of the prince or the magistrate, and are employed for this purpose when occasion requires: But they have always proved the destruction of liberty, and is abhorrent to the spirit of a free republic. In England, where they depend upon the parliament for their annual support, they have always been complained of as oppressive and unconstitutional, and are seldom employed in executing of the laws; never except on extraordinary occasions, and then under the direction of a civil magistrate. A free republic will never keep a standing army to execute its laws. It must depend upon the support of its citizens. But when a government is to receive its support from the aid of the citizens, it must be so constructed as to have the confidence, respect, and affection of the people. Men who, upon the call of the magistrate, offer themselves to execute the laws, are influenced to do it either by affection to the government, or from fear; where a standing army is at hand to punish offenders, every man is actuated by the latter principle, and therefore, when the magistrate calls, will obey: but, where this is not the case, the government must rest for its support upon the confidence and respect which the people have for their government and laws. The body of the people being attached, the government will always be sufficient to support and execute its laws, and to operate upon the fears of any faction which may be opposed to it, not only to prevent an opposition to the execution of the laws themselves, but also to compel the most of them [113]to aid the magistrate; but the people will not be likely to have such confidence in their rulers, in a republic so extensive as the United States, as necessary for these purposes. The confidence which the people have in their rulers, in a free republic, arises from their knowing them, from their being responsible to them for their conduct, and from the power they have of displacing them when they misbehave: but in a republic of the extent of this continent, the people in general would be acquainted with very few of their rulers: the people at large would know little of their proceedings, and it would be extremely difficult to change them. The people in Georgia and New-Hampshire would not know one another’s mind, and therefore could not act in concert to enable them to effect a general change of representatives. The different parts of so extensive a country could not possibly be made acquainted with the conduct of their representatives, nor be informed of the reasons upon which measures were founded. The consequence will be, they will have no confidence in their legislature, suspect them of ambitious views, be jealous of every measure they adopt, and will not support the laws they pass. Hence the government will be nerveless and inefficient, and no way will be left to render it otherwise, but by establishing an armed force to execute the laws at the point of the bayonet—a government of all others the most to be dreaded. In a republic of such vast extent as the United-States, the legislature cannot attend to the various concerns and wants of its different parts. It cannot be sufficiently numerous to be acquainted with the local condition and wants of the different districts, and if it could, it is impossible it should have sufficient time to attend to and provide for all the variety of cases of this nature, that would be continually arising. In so extensive a republic, the great officers of government would soon become above the controul of the people, and abuse their power to the purpose of aggrandizing themselves, and oppressing them. The trust committed to the executive offices, in a country of the extent of the United-States, must be various and of magnitude. The command of all the troops and navy of the republic, the appointment of officers, the power of pardoning offences, the collecting of all the public revenues, and the power of expending them, with a number of other powers, must be lodged and exercised in every state, in the hands of a few. When these are attended with great honor and emolument, as they always will be in large states, so as greatly to interest men to pursue them, and to be proper objects for ambitious and designing men, such men will be ever restless in their pursuit after them. They will use the power, when they have acquired it, to the purposes of gratifying their own interest and ambition, and it is scarcely possible, in a very large [114]republic, to call them to account for their misconduct, or to prevent their abuse of power. These are some of the reasons by which it appears, that a free republic cannot long subsist over a country of the great extent of these states. If then this new constitution is calculated to consolidate the thirteen states into one, as it evidently is, it ought not to be adopted. Though I am of opinion, that it is a sufficient objection to this government, to reject it, that it creates the whole union into one government, [un]der the form of a republic, yet if this objection was obviated, there are exceptions to it, which are so material and fundamental, that they ought to determine every man, who is a friend to the liberty and happiness of mankind, not to adopt it. ⟨I beg the candid and dispassionate attention of my countrymen while I state these objections—they are such as have obtruded themselves upon my mind upon a careful attention to the matter, and such as I sincerely believe are well founded. There are many objections, of small moment, of which I shall take no notice—perfection is not to be expected in any thing that is the production of man—and if I did not in my conscience believe that this scheme was defective in the fundamental principles—in the foundation upon which a free and equal government must rest—I would hold my peace.⟩7"

Therefore government (by such frail and imperfect creatures as men) is impossible without continual danger to liberty. Yet we find that men in all ages, and nations have shewn an astonishing credulity, in their faithless fellow-creatures; they have hoped against hope; they have believed against the sight of their own eyes.”    BURGH.3 The discussion, heretofore in favour of the requisitions of Congress of the third of February, 1781, and the 18th April, 1783,(a) for vesting that honorable body with an impost of 5 per cent. &c.4 (and that called for in 1782)(b) “of one dollar for every hundred acres of land, and a pole tax of one dollar, on all freemen and slaves: and an excise of one eighth of a dollar upon all distilled spiritious liquors,” have appeared under the favourable aspect, of a mere regulation, necessary and proper for the satisfaction of the public creditors, and the support of national faith; as if by investing Congress with a revenue, to be collected by officers in their own appointment, and laws of their own making; the public creditors would be the sooner paid, and the national faith the better preserved: but in its progression, it has received another form, we are now soon (perhaps too soon; for we have got into a way of doing business, either in secret or in haste) to be called upon, to change the very principles of our(c) government; contrary to the opinion of the best authors, and to adopt that reported by the Convention, lately assembled at Philadelphia; in which the thirteen states are to be consolidated, so as to become one republic, of upwards of four thousand(d) miles in circumference; Congress invested with legislative and judicial powers, and with it decide whether we shall establish a strong executive; as well as give up an actual for a vertual representation. The Dutch have tried both: by the one they have entirely lost the right of representation;(e) by the other, they have embarrassed themselves with a Stadtholder(f) (a strong executive) whose tyranny within the space of forty years, has become so intolerable, that the inhabitants to get rid of him, are at this day on the brink of ruin. (a) See the journals of Congress (b) See the circular letters signed Robert Morris, dated the 27th February, and 29th September, 1782.5 (c) “Polibius having traced government up to its very origin, explains the principles by which different governments arose [117]to the summit of their power, and grandeur; and proves, that they sunk to ruin, by a more or less rapid progress, in proportion as they receded more or less from the first principles on which they were originally founded.”   MONTAGUE.6 “When the efficacy of government, goes from where the constitution has placed it, into hands which have no right to it, that state is far gone to ruin.”   BURGH.7 (d) “Political societies (says the Marquis De Baccaria) have their limits circumscribed, which they cannot exceed without disturbing their œconomy. An overgrown republic, can only be saved from despotism, by subdividing it into a number of confederated republics.”8 “It is natural for a republic (says Montesquieu) to have only a small territory; otherwise it cannot long subsist. In a large republic, there are men of large fortunes, and consequently of less moderation: there are trusts too great to be placed in any single subject; he has interest of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy, great, and glorious, by oppressing his fellow citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country. In a large republic, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; it is subordinate to exceptions, and depends on accidents: in a small one, the interests of the public is easier perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses have a less extent, and of course are less protected.”9 (e) “The magistrates of a certain city in Holland, so ordered the business, that the people in a general assembly gave up the right of election, since which time, the senators have filled up all in their own body; and this example has been followed by all the other towns in the provinces.” See Bowen’s system of geography, 547–549. 27 universal history 342–343.1 (f) “This affair [i.e., office] in a manner supercedes the constitution. The stadtholder is president of the states of every province, and such is his power, and influence, that he can change the deputies, magistrates, and officers, in every province or city: by this he has the moulding of the assembly of the states general, though he has no voice in it; in short, though he has not the title, he has more real power and authority than some kings.”   Guthrie 481.11"
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,10/18/1787,"How comes it, Mr. Printer, that the goddess Liberty, lately so much adored in the United States, should now be reprobated under the name of Anarchy? Suppose that we were to treat this fair lady Liberty as the Poet advises to treat another lady of much less consequence, “Be to her faults a little blind, Be to her virtue very kind.” Perhaps this moderation of temper may arrest the haste with which some people would force the new constitution upon us, without suffering [119]amendments to be made or offered, although amendments may be necessary to secure our liberties from weak or wicked rulers."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,10/25/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. In the close of my last introductory address,1 I told you, that my object in future would be to take up this new form of national government, to compare it with the experience and opinions of the most sensible and approved political authors, and to show you that its principles, and the exercise of them will be dangerous to your liberty and happiness. Although I am conscious that this is an arduous undertaking, yet I will perform it to the best of my ability. The freedom, equality, and independence which you enjoyed by nature, induced you to consent to a political power. The same principles led you to examine the errors and vices of a British superintendence, to divest yourselves of it, and to reassume a new political shape. It is acknowledged that there are defects in this, and another is tendered to you for acceptance; the great question then, that arises on this new political principle, is, whether it will answer the ends for which it is said to be offered to you, and for which all men engage in political society, to wit, the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties, and estate.2 The recital, or premises on which this new form of government is erected, declares a consolidation or union of all the thirteen parts, or states, into one great whole, under the firm of the United States, for all the various and important purposes therein set forth.—But whoever seriously considers the immense extent of territory comprehended within the limits of the United States, together with the variety of its climates, productions, and commerce, the difference of extent, and number of inhabitants in all; the dissimilitude of interest, morals, and policies, in almost every one, will receive it as an intuitive truth, that a consolidated republican form of government therein, can never form a perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to you and your posterity, for to these objects it must be directed: this unkindred legislature therefore, composed of interests opposite and dissimilar in their nature, will in its exercise, emphatically be, like a house divided against itself.3 The governments of Europe have taken their limits and form from adventitious circumstances, and nothing can be argued on the motive of agreement from them; but these adventitious political principles, have nevertheless produced effects that have attracted the attention of philosophy, which has established axioms in the science of politics therefrom, as irrefragable as any in Euclid. It is natural, says Montesquieu, to a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist: in a large one, there are men of large fortunes, and consequently of less [127]moderation; there are too great deposits to intrust in the hands of a single subject, an ambitious person soon becomes sensible that he may be happy, great, and glorious by oppressing his fellow citizens, and that he might raise himself to grandeur, on the ruins of his country. In large republics, the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views; in a small one the interest of the public is easily perceived, better understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses have a less extent, and of course are less protected—he also shews you, that the duration of the republic of Sparta, was owing to its having continued with the same extent of territory after all its wars; and that the ambition of Athens and Lacedemon to command and direct the union, lost them their liberties, and gave them a monarchy.4 From this picture, what can you promise yourselves, on the score of consolidation of the United States, into one government—impracticability in the just exercise of it—your freedom insecure—even this form of government limited in its continuance—the employments of your country disposed of to the opulent, to whose contumely you will continually be an object—you must risque much, by indispensibly placing trusts of the greatest magnitude, into the hands of individuals, whose ambition for power, and agrandisement, will oppress and grind you—where, from the vast extent of your territory, and the complication of interests, the science of government will become intricate and perplexed, and too misterious for you to understand, and observe; and by which you are to be conducted into a monarchy, either limited or despotic; the latter, Mr. Locke remarks, is a government derived from neither nature, nor compact. Political liberty, the great Montesquieu again observes, consists in security, or at least in the opinion we have of security;6 and this security therefore, or the opinion, is best obtained in moderate governments, where the mildness of the laws, and the equality of the manners, beget a confidence in the people, which produces this security, or the opinion. This moderation in governments, depends in a great measure on their limits, connected with their political distribution. The extent of many of the states in the Union, is at this time, almost too great for the superintendence of a republican form of government, and must one day or other, revolve into more vigorous ones, or by separation be reduced into smaller, and more useful, as well as moderate ones. You have already observed the feeble efforts of Massachusetts against their insurgents;7 with what difficulty did they quell that insurrection; and is not the province of main at this moment, on the eve of separation from her. The reason of these things is, that, for the security of the property of the community, in which expressive term Mr. Lock makes life, liberty, and estate, to consist8—the wheels of a free [128]republic are necessarily slow in their operation; hence in large free republics, the evil sometimes is not only begun, but almost completed, before they are in a situation to turn the current into a contrary progression: the extremes are also too remote from the usual seat of government, and the laws therefore too feeble to afford protection to all its parts, and insure domestic tranquility without the aid of another principle. If, therefore, this state, and that of N. Carolina, had an army under their controul, they never would have lost Vermont, and Frankland, nor the state of Massachusetts suffer an insurrection, or the dismemberment of her fairest district, but the exercise of a principle which would have prevented these things, if we may believe the experience of ages, would have ended in the destruction of their liberties. Will this consolidated republic, if established, in its exercise beget such confidence and compliance, among the citizens of these states, as to do without the aid of a standing army—I deny that it will.—The mal-contents in each state, who will not be a few, nor the least important, will be exciting factions against it—the fear of a dismemberment of some of its parts, and the necessity to enforce the execution of revenue laws (a fruitful source of oppression) on the extremes and in the other districts of the government, will incidentally, and necessarily require a permanent force, to be kept on foot—will not political security, and even the opinion of it, be extinguished? can mildness and moderation exist in a government, where the primary incident in its exercise must be force? will not violence destroy confidence, and can equality subsist, where the extent, policy, and practice of it, will naturally lead to make odious distinctions among citizens? The people, who may compose this national legislature from the southern states, in which, from the mildness of the climate, the fertility of the soil, and the value of its productions, wealth is rapidly acquired, and where the same causes naturally lead to luxury, dissipation, and a passion for aristocratic, distinctions; where slavery is encouraged, and liberty of course, less respected, and protected; who know not what it is to acquire property by their own toil, nor to economise with the savings of industry—will these men therefore be as tenacious of the liberties and interests of the more northern states, where freedom, independence, industry, equality, and frugality, are natural to the climate and soil, as men who are your own citizens, legislating in your own state, under your inspection, and whose manners, and fortunes, bear a more equal resemblance to your own? It may be suggested, in answer to this, that whoever is a citizen of one state, is a citizen of each, and that therefore he will be as interested in the happiness and interest of all, as the one he is delegated from; [129]but the argument is fallacious, and, whoever has attended to the history of mankind, and the principles which bind them together as parents, citizens, or men, will readily perceive it. These principles are, in their exercise, like a pebble cast on the calm surface of a river, the circles begin in the center, and are small, active, and forcible, but as they depart from that point, they lose their force, and vanish into calmness. ⟨The strongest principle of union resides within our domestic walls. The ties of the parent exceed that of any other; as we depart from home, the next general principle of union is amongst citizens of the same state, where acquaintance, habits, and fortunes, nourish affection, and attachment; enlarge the circle still further, &, as citizens of different states, though we acknowledge the same national denomination, we lose the ties of acquaintance, habits, and fortunes, and thus, by degrees, we lessen in our attachments, till, at length, we no more than acknowledge a sameness of species.⟩9 Is it therefore, from certainty like this, reasonable to believe, that inhabitants of Georgia, or New-Hampshire, will have the same obligations towards you as your own, and preside over your lives, liberties, and property, with the same care and attachment? Intuitive reason, answers in the negative. In the course of my examination of the principles of consolidation of the states into one general government, many other reasons against it have occurred, but I flatter myself, from those herein offered to your consideration, I have convinced you that it is both presumptious and impracticable consistent with your safety. To detain you with further remarks, would be useless—I shall however, continue in my following numbers, to anilise this new government, pursuant to my promise."
Newspaper,No,A Republican,,New York Journal,,10/25/1787,"SIR, In Mr. Child’s Daily Advertiser of the 13th inst. a publication appeared, which is said to be a speech delivered by you to the citizens of Philadelphia, and intended to explain and elucidate the principles and arrangements of the constitution formed by the Federal Convention for the United States, and submitted to public consideration.—When this performance was announced, as the first authoritative explanation of that system, it was read with avidity—by its advocates, because they were prejudiced in its favor, and possessed the fullest confidence (from your supposed abilities) that the objections raised against it would be refuted—by its opponents, because they were anxious to know what could be alledged in its favor—the former are disappointed and mortified—the latter ridicule the feeble attempt, as leading only to a discovery of the source from which the defects originated; for, from the text and comment it would appear, that you had a principal agency in the business.—Your address is confined to the citizens of a partial district, but the subject affects the happiness of America; it is therefore open to the examination of every citizen, and I shall make no apology for troubling you with the following animadversions. [131 You have prefaced your refutation (as you term it) of the charges alledged against this new system, by a discrimination between the state constitutions and the one under consideration. To prevent mistakes, I shall take the liberty to recite it in your own words—“When the people established the powers of legislation under their separate governments, they invested their representatives with every right and authority which they did not in explicit terms reserve; and therefore upon every question respecting the jurisdiction of the house of assembly, if the frame of government is silent, the jurisdiction is efficient and complete. But in delegating federal powers, another criterion was necessarily introduced, and the congressional authority is to be collected not from tacit implication, but from the positive grant expressed in the instrument of union. Hence, you add, it is evident, that in the former case every thing which is not reserved is given, but in the latter, the reverse of the proposition prevails, and every thing which is not given is reserved.” As it is upon the truth of this distinction, which carries with it, at first blush, a degree of plausability, that you rest the defence of this constitution, in omitting a bill of rights, and particularly a stipulation for the security of the freedom of the press, it is proper that it should be carefully examined. Is there any thing in the nature of the two cases that will justify this discrimination? Do they not both depend on compact, and receive their sanction from the people, as the source and origin of all political power? Can the reasonable mind conceive of a compact granting what is not expressed in it, incident to, and necessary to the execution of the power given, or implied under the general terms in which they are expressed? certainly not; and the contrary would suppose, that the power was derived from the rulers, and not from the people—but in both cases the powers conferred will be considered as efficient, as far as the nature of the compact extends. It clearly follows then, that the criterion, you mention, was not necessarily, or naturally, introduced, and it only remains to examine, whether it depends upon stipulation. In forming our present confederation, it was declared, “that each state shall retain its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by that confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.”1 This declaration would have been idle and useless, if the position, you state, was founded in fact—Is there any such stipulation to be found in this new constitution? there is not—But let us investigate this subject a little farther—let us compare it with the sense of the framers, as expressed in the instrument itself—this, perhaps, is the truest test. There are extensive powers of legislation granted to this new government—it would be [132]needless, in me, to enumerate them; but there are also several exceptions made against the exercise of certain powers.—Now, according to your doctrine, unless these powers which are excepted were expressly granted; the exceptions would be “superfluous and absurd.” For brevity sake, I shall instance one of those exceptions only. “It is provided, that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.” Is this power expressly given to Congress by the new constitution? if it is not, then the exception must be to guard against an incidental or implied power.—And hence it clearly follows, that the framers of this new government, so far from adopting your construction, as to the origination of congressional power, adopted the very principle that you have laid down with respect to the individual states. But in order the more fully to evince the fallacy of your observations, I must claim the liberty of quoting some other parts of your address.—You observe, “If indeed a power, similar to that which has been granted for the regulation of commerce, had been granted, to regulate literary publications, it would have been as necessary to stipulate, that the liberty of the press should be preserved inviolate, as that the impost should be general in its operation.” But you assert as a fact, “That the proposed system possesses no influence whatever upon the press;” and thence infer, “That it would have been merely nugatory to have introduced a formal declaration upon the subject; nay, that very declaration might be construed to imply, that some degree of power was given, since it was undertaken to define its extent.” Now it will be proper to enquire, whether the fact, from which you have drawn you inferences, is well founded. Does this constitution possess, as you assert, no influence whatever upon the press? Is there not a provision in it, “to secure for a limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” I do not mean to call in question the propriety of this provision, but I would ask, whether under it the press may not be considered subject to the influence and controul of this government?—Will it be denied that this power includes in it (in some measure) that of regulating literary publications? certainly it cannot, unless we suppose what would be very absurd, “that authors, who are to be secured the exclusive right of their writings, are at the same time to be deprived of the use of the press.” This then, being the case, it clearly follows, and you have admitted it, that, a stipulation for preserving inviolate the liberty of the press was necessary and proper.—And hence too it evidently appears, that the silence, which is observed on this interesting subject, was not occasioned by the extremely delicate consideration to which you attribute it. To what cause then is the omission, and your attempts to deceive your [133]fellow citizens, to be ascribed?—The press is the scourge of tyrants and the grand paladium of liberty. I shall reserve the remarks I intend to make on the remainder of your speech for future letters, but before I close the present, permit me to ask. whether the formal declaration, that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, is to be construed to imply, that some degree of power is given to introduce a nobility? and whether America (as it would appear you are deep in her councils) among the other great blessings she may derive from the adoption of this new constitution, may expect (by the permission of Congress) to be favored with a foreign or self-created nobility. New-York, October 19, 1787."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Packet,,10/26/1787,"A correspondent observes, that the wisdom of the late Federal Convention is not doubted—but they may have erred. It is to be wished their report may have a wise and temperate discussion, and if it will not bear a severe trial, that it may not be adopted. A revolution every seven years must be very expensive and dangerous, and deprive us of the benefits we might derive from even an imperfect constitution."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,11/1/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. I flatter myself that my last address established this position, that to reduce the Thirteen States into one government, would prove the destruction of your liberties. But lest this truth should be doubted by some, I will now proceed to consider its merits. Though it should be admitted, that the argument against reducing all the states into one consolidated government, are not sufficient fully to establish this point; yet they will, at least, justify this conclusion, that in forming a constitution for such a country, great care should be taken to limit and define its powers, adjust its parts, and guard against an abuse of authority. How far attention has been paid to these objects, shall be the subject of future enquiry. When a building is to be erected which is intended to stand for ages, the foundation should be firmly laid. The constitution proposed to your acceptance, is designed not for yourselves alone, but for generations yet unborn. The principles, therefore, upon which the social compact is founded, ought to have been clearly and precisely stated, and the most express and full declaration of rights to have been made—But on this subject there is almost an entire silence. If we may collect the sentiments of the people of America, from their own most solemn declarations, they hold this truth as self evident, that all men are by nature free. No one man, therefore, or any class of men, have a right, by the law of nature, or of God, to assume or exercise authority over their fellows. The origin of society then is to be sought, not in any natural right which one man has to exercise authority over another, but in the united consent of those who associate. The mutual wants of men, at first dictated the propriety of forming societies; and when they were established, protection and defence pointed out the necessity of instituting government. In a state of nature every individual pursues his own interest; in this pursuit it frequently happened, that the possessions or enjoyments of one were sacrificed to the views and [155]designs of another; thus the weak were a prey to the strong, the simple and unwary were subject to impositions from those who were more crafty and designing. In this state of things, every individual was insecure; common interest therefore directed, that government should be established, in which the force of the whole community should be collected, and under such directions, as to protect and defend every one who composed it. The common good, therefore, is the end of civil government, and common consent, the foundation on which it is established. To effect this end, it was necessary that a certain portion of natural liberty should be surrendered, in order, that what remained should be preserved: how great a proportion of natural freedom is necessary to be yielded by individuals, when they submit to government, I shall not now enquire. So much, however, must be given up, as will be sufficient to enable those, to whom the administration of the government is committed, to establish laws for the promoting the happiness of the community, and to carry those laws into effect. But it is not necessary, for this purpose, that individuals should relinquish all their natural rights. Some are of such a nature that they cannot be surrendered. Of this kind are the rights of conscience, the right of enjoying and defending life, &c. Others are not necessary to be resigned, in order to attain the end for which government is instituted, these therefore ought not to be given up. To surrender them, would counteract the very end of government, to wit, the common good. From these observations it appears, that in forming a government on its true principles, the foundation should be laid in the manner I before stated, by expressly reserving to the people such of their essential natural rights, as are not necessary to be parted with. The same reasons which at first induced mankind to associate and institute government, will operate to influence them to observe this precaution. If they had been disposed to conform themselves to the rule of immutable righteousness, government would not have been requisite. It was because one part exercised fraud, oppression, and violence on the other, that men came together, and agreed that certain rules should be formed, to regulate the conduct of all, and the power of the whole community lodged in the hands of rulers to enforce an obedience to them. But rulers have the same propensities as other men; they are as likely to use the power with which they are vested for private purposes, and to the injury and oppression of those over whom they are placed, as individuals in a state of nature are to injure and oppress one another. It is therefore as proper that bounds should be set to their authority, as that government should have at first been instituted to restrain private injuries. [156 This principle, which seems so evidently founded in the reason and nature of things, is confirmed by universal experience. Those who have governed, have been found in all ages ever active to enlarge their powers and abridge the public liberty. This has induced the people in all countries, where any sense of freedom remained, to fix barriers against the encroachments of their rulers. The country from which we have derived our origin, is an eminent example of this. Their magna charta and bill of rights have long been the boast, as well as the security, of that nation. I need say no more, I presume, to an American, than, that this principle is a fundamental one, in all the constitutions of our own states; there is not one of them but what is either founded on a declaration or bill of rights, or has certain express reservation of rights interwoven in the body of them. From this it appears, that at a time when the pults of liberty beat high, and when an appeal was made to the people to form constitutions for the government of themselves, it was their universal sense, that such declarations should make a part of their frames of government. It is therefore the more astonishing, that this grand security, to the rights of the people, is not to be found in this constitution. It has been said, in answer to this objection, that such declaration of rights, however requisite they might be in the constitutions of the states, are not necessary in the general constitution, because, “in the former case, every thing which is not reserved is given, but in the latter the reverse of the proposition prevails, and every thing which is not given is reserved.”1 It requires but little attention to discover, that this mode of reasoning is rather specious than solid. The powers, rights, and authority, granted to the general government by this constitution, are as complete, with respect to every object to which they extend, as that of any state government—It reaches to every thing which concerns human happiness—Life, liberty, and property, are under its controul. There is the same reason, therefore, that the exercise of power, in this case, should be restrained within proper limits, as in that of the state governments. To set this matter in a clear light, permit me to instance some of the articles of the bills of rights of the individual states, and apply them to the case in question. For the security of life, in criminal prosecutions, the bills of rights of most of the states have declared, that no man shall be held to answer for a crime until he is made fully acquainted with the charge brought against him; he shall not be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself—The witnesses against him shall be brought face to face, and he shall be fully heard by himself or counsel. That it is essential to the security of life and liberty, that trial of facts be in the vicinity [157]where they happen. Are not provisions of this kind as necessary in the general government, as in that of a particular state? The powers vested in the new Congress extend in many cases to life; they are authorised to provide for the punishment of a variety of capital crimes, and no restraint is laid upon them in its exercise, save only, that “the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed.” No man is secure of a trial in the county where he is charged to have committed a crime; he may be brought from Niagara to New-York, or carried from Kentucky to Richmond for trial for an offence, supposed to be committed. What security is there, that a man shall be furnished with a full and plain description of the charges against him? That he shall be allowed to produce all proof he can in his favor? That he shall see the witnesses against him face to face, or that he shall be fully heard in his own defence by himself or counsel? For the security of liberty it has been declared, “that excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted—That all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or seize any person, his papers or property, are grievous and oppressive.”2 These provisions are as necessary under the general government as under that of the individual states; for the power of the former is as complete to the purpose of requiring bail, imposing fines, inflicting punishments, granting search warrants, and seizing persons, papers, or property, in certain cases, as the other.For the purpose of securing the property of the citizens, it is declared by all the states, “that in all controversies at law, respecting property, the ancient mode of trial by jury is one of the best securities of the rights of the people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable.”3 Does not the same necessity exist of reserving this right, under this national compact, as in that of the states? Yet nothing is said respecting it. In the bills of rights of the states it is declared, that a well regulated militia is the proper and natural defence of a free government4—That as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous, they are not to be kept up,5 and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and controuled by the civil power.6 The same security is as necessary in this constitution, and much more so; for the general government will have the sole power to raise and to pay armies, and are under no controul in the exercise of it; yet nothing of this is to be found in this new system. I might proceed to instance a number of other rights, which were as necessary to be reserved, such as, that elections should be free, that [158]the liberty of the press should be held sacred; but the instances adduced, are sufficient to prove, that this argument is without foundation.—Besides, it is evident, that the reason here assigned was not the true one, why the framers of this constitution omitted a bill of rights; if it had been, they would not have made certain reservations, while they totally omitted others of more importance. We find they have, in the 9th section of the 1st article, declared, that the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of rebellion—that no bill of attainder, or expost facto law, shall be passed—that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States, &c. If every thing which is not given is reserved, what propriety is there in these exceptions? Does this constitution any where grant the power of suspending the habeas corpus, to make expost facto laws, pass bills of attainder, or grant titles of nobility? It certainly does not in express terms. The only answer that can be given is, that these are implied in the general powers granted. With equal truth it may be said, that all the powers, which the bills of rights, guard against the abuse of, are contained or implied in the general ones granted by this constitution. So far it is from being true, that a bill of rights is less necessary in the general constitution than in those of the states, the contrary is evidently the fact.—This system, if it is possible for the people of America to accede to it, will be an original compact; and being the last, will, in the nature of things, vacate every former agreement inconsistent with it. For it being a plan of government received and ratified by the whole people, all other forms, which are in existence at the time of its adoption, must yield to it. This is expressed in positive and unequivocal terms, in the 6th article, “That this constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution, or laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding.7 “The senators and representatives before-mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States, and of the several states, shall be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this constitution.” It is therefore not only necessarily implied thereby, but positively expressed, that the different state constitutions are repealed and entirely done away, so far as they are inconsistent with this, with the laws which shall be made in pursuance thereof, or with treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States; of what [159]avail will the constitutions of the respective states be to preserve the rights of its citizens? should they be plead, the answer would be, the constitution of the United States, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, is the supreme law, and all legislatures and judicial officers, whether of the general or state governments, are bound by oath to support it. No priviledge, reserved by the bills of rights, or secured by the state governments, can limit the power granted by this, or restrain any laws made in pursuance of it. It stands therefore on its own bottom, and must receive a construction by itself without any reference to any other—And hence it was of the highest importance, that the most precise and express declarations and reservations of rights should have been made. This will appear the more necessary, when it is considered, that not only the constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof, but all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, are the supreme law of the land, and supersede the constitutions of all the states. The power to make treaties, is vested in the president, by and with the advice and consent of two thirds of the senate. I do not find any limitation, or restriction, to the exercise of this power. The most important article in any constitution may therefore be repealed, even without a legislative act. Ought not a government, vested with such extensive and indefinite authority, to have been restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly ought. So clear a point is this, that I cannot help suspecting, that persons who attempt to persuade people, that such reservations were less necessary under this constitution than under those of the states, are wilfully endeavouring to deceive, and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/1/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, A speech made to the citizens of Philadelphia, and said to be by Mr. WILSON, appears to me to abound with sophistry, so dangerous, as to require refutation. If we adopt the new Constitution, let us at least understand it. Whether it deserves adoption or not, we can only determine by a full examination of it, so as clearly to discern what it is that we are so loudly, I had almost said, indecently called upon to receive. Such an examination is the object of the papers which I am to entreat you to lay before the public, in answer to Mr. Wilson, and under the signature of—Cincinnatus. SIR, You have had the graciousness. Sir, to come forward as the defender and panegyrist of the plan of a new Constitution, of which you was one of the framers. If the defence you have thought proper to set up, and the explanations you have been pleased to give, should be found, upon a full and fair examination, to be fallacious or inadequate; I am not without hope, that candor, of which no gentleman talks more, will render you a convert to the opinion, that some material parts of the proposed Constitution are so constructed—that a monstrous aristocracy springing from it, must necessarily swallow up the democratic rights of the union, and sacrifice the liberties of the people to the power and domination of a few. If your defence of this new plan of power, has, as you say, been matured by four months constant meditation upon it, and is yet so very weak, as I trust will appear, men will begin to think, that—the thing [162]itself is indefensible. Upon a subject so momentous, the public has a right to the sentiments of every individual that will reason: I therefore do not think any apology necessary for appearing in print; and I hope to avoid, at least, the indiscriminate censure which you have, with so much candor and liberality, thrown on those who will not worship your idol—“that they are industriously endeavouring to prevent and destroy it, by insidious and clandestine attempts.” Give me leave just to suggest, that perhaps these clandestine attempts might have been owing to the terror of your mob, which so nobly endeavoured to prevent all freedom of action and of speech.1 The reptile Doctor, who was employed to blow the trumpet of persecution, would have answered the public reasoning of an opponent, by hounding on him the rage of a deluded populace.2 It was to such men, and under such impressions, that you made the speech which I am now to examine; no wonder then that it was received with loud and unanimous testamonies of their approbation. They were vociferating through you the panegyric of their own intemperate opinions. Your first attempt is to apologize for so very obvious a defect as—the omission of a declaration of rights. This apology consists in a very ingenious discovery; that in the state constitutions, whatever is not reserved is given; but in the congressional constitution, whatever is not given, is reserved. This has more the quaintness of a conundrum, than the dignity of an argument. The conventions that made the state and the general constitutions, sprang from the same source, were delegated for the same purpose—that is, for framing rules by which we should be governed, and ascertaining those powers which it was necessary to vest in our rulers. Where then is this distinction to be found, but in your assumption? Is it in the powers given to the members of convention? no—Is it in the constitution? not a word of it:—And yet on this play of words, this dictum of yours, this distinction without a difference, you would persuade us to rest our most essential rights. I trust, however, that the good sense of this free people cannot be so easily imposed on by professional figments. The confederation, in its very outset, declares—that what is not expressly given, is reserved.3 This constitution makes no such reservation. The presumption therefore is, that the framers of the proposed constitution, did not mean to subject it to the same exception. You instance, Sir, the liberty of the press; which you would persuade us, is in no danger, though not secured, because there is no express power granted to regulate literary publications. But you surely know, Sir, that where general powers are expressly granted, the particular [163]ones comprehended within them, must also be granted. For instance, the proposed Congress are empowered—to define and punish offences against the law of nations—mark well, Sir, if you please—to define and punish. Will you, will any one say, can any one even think that does not comprehend a power to define and declare all publications from the press against the conduct of government, in making treaties, or in any other foreign transactions, an offence against the law of nations? If there should ever be an influential president, or arbitrary senate, who do not choose that their transactions with foreign powers should be discussed or examined in the public prints, they will easily find pretexts to prevail upon the other branch to concur with them, in restraining what it may please them to call—the licentiousness of the press. And this may be, even without the concurrence of the representatives of the people; because the president and senate are empowered to make treaties, and these treaties are declared the supreme law of the land. What use they will make of this power, is not now the question. Certain it is, that such power is given, and that power is not restrained by any declaration—that the liberty of the press, which even you term, the sacred palladium of national freedom, shall be forever free and inviolable. I have proved that the power of restraining the press, is necessarily involved in the unlimited power of defining offences, or of making treaties, which are to be the supreme law of the land. You acknowledge, that it is not expressly excepted, and consequently it is at the mercy of the powers to be created by this constitution. Let us suppose then, that what has happened, may happen again: That a patriotic printer, like Peter Zenger, should incur the resentment of our new rulers, by publishing to the world, transactions which they wish to conceal. If he should be prosecuted, if his judges should be as desirous of punishing him, at all events, as the judges were to punish Peter Zenger, what would his innocence or his virtue avail him? This constitution is so admirably framed for tyranny, that, by clear construction, the judges might put the verdict of a jury out of the question. Among the cases in which the court is to have appellate jurisdiction, are—controversies, to which the United States are a party:—In this appellate jurisdiction, the judges are to determine, both law and fact. That is, the court is both judge and jury. The attorney general then would have only to move a question of law in the court below, to ground an appeal to the supreme judicature, and the printer would be delivered up to the mercy of his judges. Peter Zenger’s case will teach us, what mercy he might expect. Thus, if the president, vice-president, [164]or any officer, or favorite of state, should be censured in print, he might effectually deprive the printer, or author, of his trial by jury, and subject him to something, that will probably very much resemble the—Star Chamber of former times.4 The freedom of the press, the sacred palladium of public liberty, would be pulled down;—all useful knowledge on the conduct of government would be withheld from the people—the press would become subservient to the purposes of bad and arbitrary rulers, and imposition, not information, would be its object. The printers would do well, to publish the proceedings of the judges, in Peter Zenger’s case—they would do well to publish lord Mansfield’s conduct in, the King against Woodfall;—that the public mind may be property warned of the consequences of agreeing to a constitution, which provides no security for the freedom of the press, and leaves it controversial at least—whether in matter of libels against any of our intended rulers; the printer would even have the security of trial by jury. Yet it was the jury only, that saved Zenger, it was a jury only, that saved Woodfall, it can only be a jury that will save any future printer from the fangs of power.5 Had you, Mr. Wilson, who are so unmerciful against what you are pleased to call, the disingenuous conduct of those who dislike the constitution; had you been ingenuous enough to have stated this fairly to our fellow citizens; had you said to them—gentlemen, it is true, that the freedom of the press is not provided for; it is true, that it may be restrained at pleasure, by our proposed rulers; it is true, that a printer sued for a libel, would not be tried by a jury; all this is true, nay, worse than this is also true; but then it is all necessary to what I think, the best form of government that has ever been offered the world. To have stated these truths, would at least have been acting like an honest man; and if it did not procure you such unanimous testimonies of approbation, what you would have received, would have been merited. But you choose to shew our fellow citizens, nothing but what would flatter and mislead them. You exhibited, that by a rush-light only, which, to dissipate its darkness, required the full force of the meridian sun. When the people are fully apprized of the chains you have prepared for them, if they choose to put them on, you have nothing to answer for. If they choose to be tenants at will of their liberties, by the new constitution; instead of having their freehold in them, secured by a declaration of rights; I can only lament it. There was a time, when our fellow citizens were told, in the words of Sir Edward Coke—For a man to be tenant at will of his liberty, I can never agree to it—Etiam si Dominus non sit molestus, tamen miserremum est, posse, se vebit—Though a despot may not act tyrannically; yet it is dreadful to [165]think, that if he will, he may. Perhaps you may also remember, Sir, that our fellow citizens were then warned against those—“smooth words, with which the most dreadful designs may be glossed over.” You have given us a lively comment on your own text. You have varnished over the iron trap that is prepared, and bated with some illustrious names, to catch the liberties of the people."
Newspaper,No,Timoleon,,New York Journal,,11/1/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, I was lately invited to pass the evening with a club of grave and sensible men, who are in the practice of assembling weekly to converse on public affairs; and having been previously made acquainted, by my introducing friend, with the characters, situations, and circumstances of the persons who composed this club, I found that they were not officers of the present government, and that there was little probability of any among them becoming suitors (or seekers, as now called) for place, or employment under the new Constitution, if it should succeed. I judged from their contented and independent characters, that they had no view to place of finance, of judge, or attorney-general, or tax collectors, or any other office of emolument, which so often drives men to prostitute their abilities for the support of bad measures, from expectation of great profit. I accepted, with pleasure, an opportunity of hearing the sentiments of such respectable characters, on so interesting a subject as public affairs, especially at this crisis, when the minds of men are on one side violently agitated and active; on the other, and the greater part, a sleepy indolence and inattention seems to prevail. As I expected, so it happened, [167]that, the conversation turned upon the new Constitution offered by the late Convention. After some judicious reflections on this subject, which tended to shew the necessity of the most plain and unequivocal language in the all important business of constituting government, which necessarily conveying great powers, is always liable (from the natural tendency of power to corrupt the human heart and deprave the head) to great abuse; by perverse and subtle arguments calculated to extend dominion over all things and all men. One of the club supposed the following case:—A gentleman in the line of his profession is appointed a judge of the supreme court under the new Constitution, and the rulers, finding that the rights of conscience and the freedom of the press were exercised in such a manner, by preaching and printing as to be troublesome to the new government—which event would probably happen, if the rulers finding themselves possessed of great power, should so use it as to oppress and injure the community.—In this state of things the judge is called upon, in the line of his profession, to give his opinion—whether the new Constitution admitted of a legislative act to suppress the rights of conscience, and violate the liberty of the press? The answer of the learned judge is conceived in didactic mode, and expressed in learned phrase; thus,—In the 8th section of the first article of the new Constitution, the Congress have power given to lay and collect taxes for the general welfare of the United States. By this power, the right of taxing is co-extensive with the general welfare, and the general welfare is as unlimitted as actions and things are that may disturb or benefit that general welfare. A right being given to tax for the general welfare, necessarily includes the right of judging what is for the general welfare, and a right of judging what is for the general welfare, as necessarily includes a power of protecting, defending, and promoting it by all such laws and means as are fitted to that end; for, qui dat finem dat media ad finem necessaria, who gives the end gives the means necessary to obtain the end. The Constitution must be so construed as not to involve an absurdity, which would clearly follow from allowing the end and denying the means. A right of taxing for the general welfare being the highest and most important mode of providing for it, cannot be supposed to exclude inferior modes of effecting the same purpose, because the rule of law is, that, omne majus continet in se minus.1 From hence it clearly results, that, if preachers and printers are troublesome to the new government; and that in the opinion of its rulers, it shall be for the general welfare to restrain or suppress both the one and the other, it may be done consistently with the new Constitution. And that this was the opinion of the community when they consented [168]to it, is evident from this consideration; that although the all comprehending power of the new legislature is fixed, by its acts being made the supreme law of the land, any thing in the Constitutions or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding: Yet no express declaration in favor of the rights of conscience or liberty of the press is to be found in the new Constitution, as we see was carefully done in the Constitutions of the states composing this union—Shewing clearly, that what was then thought necessary to be specially reserved from the pleasure of power, is now designed to be yielded to its will. A grave old gentleman of the club, who had sat with his head reclined on his hand, listening in pensive mood to the argument of the judge, said, “I verily believe, that neither the logic or the law of that opinion will be hereafter doubted by the professors of power, who, through the history of human nature, have been for enlarging the sphere of their authority. And thus the dearest rights of men and the best security of civil liberty may be sacrificed by the sophism of a lawyer, who, Carneades like, can to day shew that to be necessary, before the people, which to-morrow he can likewise shew to be unnecessary and useless—For which reason the sagacious Cato advised, that such a man should immediately be sent from the city, as a person dangerous to the morals of the people and to society.”2 The old gentleman continued, “I now plainly see the necessity of express declarations and reservations in favor of the great, unalienable rights of mankind, to prevent the oppressive and wicked extention of power to the ruin of human liberty. For the opinion above stated, absolutely refutes the sophistry of ‘that being retained which is not given,’ where the words conveying power admit of the most extensive construction that language can reach to, or the mind conceive, as is the case in this new Constitution. By which we have already seen how logically it may be proved, that both religion and the press can be made to bend before the views of power. With as little ceremony, and similar constructive doctrine, the inestimable trial by jury can likewise be depraved and destroyed—because the Constitution in the 2d section of the 3d article, by expressly assuming the trial by jury in criminal cases, and being silent about it in civil causes, evidently declares it to be unnecessary in the latter. And more strongly so, by giving the supreme court jurisdiction in appeals, ‘both as to law and fact’. If to this be added, that the trial by jury in criminal cases is only stipulated to be ‘in the state,’ not in the county where the crime is supposed to have been committed; one excellent part of the jury trial, from the vicinage, or at least from the county, is even in criminal cases rendered precarious, and at the mercy of rulers under the new Constitution.—Yet the danger to liberty, peace, and property, from restraining [169]and injuring this excellent mode of trial, will clearly appear from the following observations of the learned Dr. Blackstone, in his commentaries on the laws of England, Art. Jury Trial Book 3. chap. 33.—‘The establishment of jury trial was always so highly esteemed and valued by the people, that no conquest, no change of government, could ever prevail to abolish it. In magna charta it is more than once insisted upon as the principal bulwark of our liberties—And this is a species of knowledge most absolutely necessary for every gentleman; as well, because he may be frequently called upon to determine in this capacity the rights of others, his fellow subjects; as, because his own properly, his liberty, and his life, depend upon maintaining in its legal force the trial by jury—In settling and adjusting a question of fact, when intrusted to any single magistrate, partiality and injustice have an ample field to range in; either by boldly asserting that to be proved which is not so, or by more artfully suppressing some circumstances, stretching and warping others, and distinguishing away the remainder. Here therefore a competent number of sensible and upright jurymen, chosen from among those of the middle rank, will be found the best investigators of truth, and the surest guardians of public justice. For the most powerful individual in the state will be cautious of committing any flagrant invasion of anothers right, when he knows that the fact of his oppression must be examined and decided by twelve indifferent men, not appointed until the hour of trial; and that when once the fact is ascertained, the law must, of course, redress it. This, therefore, preserves in the hands of the people that share, which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens. Every new tribunal, erected for the decision of facts, without the intervention of a jury (whether composed of justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, judges of a court of conscience, or any other standing magistrates) is a step towards establishing aristocracy, the most oppressive of absolute governments. And in every country as the trial by jury has been gradually disused, so the great have increased in power, until the state has been torn to pieces by rival factions, and oligarchy in effect has been established, though under the shadow of regal government; unless where the miserable people have taken shelter under absolute monarchy, as the lighter evil of the two. And, particularly, it is worthy of observation, that in Sweden the trial by jury, that bulwark of liberty, continued long in its full force, but is now fallen into disuse; and that there, though the regal power is in no country so closely limitted, yet the liberties of the commons are extinguished, and the government is degenerated into a mere aristocracy. It is therefore upon the whole, a duty which every man owes to his country, his friends, his posterity, and himself to maintain, to [170]the utmost of his power, this valuable trial by jury in all its rights.’[”]3 Thus far the learned Dr. Blackstone.—“Could the Doctor, if he were here, at this moment, continued the old gentleman, have condemned those parts of the new Constitution in stronger terms, which give the supreme court jurisdiction both as to law and fact; and which have weakened the jury trial in criminal cases, and which have discountenanced it in all civil causes? At first I wondered at the complaint that some people made of this new Constitution, because it led to the government of a few; but it is fairly to be concluded, from this injury to the trial by jury, that some who framed this new system, saw with Dr. Blackstone, how operative jury trial was in preventing the tyranny of the great ones, and therefore frowned upon it, as this new Constitution does. But we may hope that our fellow citizens will not approve of this new plan of government, before they have well considered it, and that they will insist on such amendments to it, as will secure from violation the just rights and liberty of the people.” The club listened, with great attention, to the worthy old gentleman, and joined him in hearty wishes, that the people may be upon their guard, and not suffer themselves to be deprived of liberty, under the notion of strong federal government—because the design of all government should be the happiness of the people, and it is not necessary for the purpose of securing happiness, that power should be given rulers to destroy happiness. I was an attentive hearer, Mr. Greenleaf, of what passed in this honest club, and I have given it to you as nearly as my memory (which is not a bad one) enables me to do. I confess to you, that I felt my mind much informed upon this all important business, the new Constitution, which, when first I saw it, and hastily read it, I found my imagination quickly taken with the good parts of it, and so passed over those great and fundamental errors, which, if agreed to, must inevitably convert the people of this free country into hewers of wood and drawers of water4 for the few great ones, into whose hands all power will be thereby unwarily delivered. New-York, October 24, 1787."
Letter,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,11/7/1787,"Extract of a letter from N. York, Nov. 4. “It is astonishing with what a high hand matters are carried in Massachusetts, relative to the adoption of the New Constitution. Freedom of enquiry, particularly among the Bostonians, seems to be put entirely out of countenance.2 John Adam’s Chickens (commonly called the Well Born) are already, in imagination, completely mounted upon the shoulders of the populace.3—Some nations have been cheated out of their freedom by a long concatenation of subtilty and deceit; there are, in [186]this country, too many that would carry the same point by downright impudence and effrontery: ‘Who first the generous steed opprest Not kneeling did salute the beast; But with high courage, life, and force Approaching, tam’d the unruly horse.’ “The clergy, I find, are, generally, very busy in proving by their present (as well as by some past) conduct, that politics and theology are by no means incompatible. I had hitherto imagined, this order of men were paid and maintained by the people to keep them in mind of their duty to God and their neighbours. But, it seems, they have a sufficiency of leisure upon their hands to fix, at least, one eye pretty steadily upon the political affairs of the world we are in.”4"
Newspaper,No,Brutus Junior,,New York Journal,,11/8/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, I have read with a degree of attention several publications which have lately appeared in favour of the new Constitution; and as far as I am able to discern—the arguments (if they can be so termed) of most weight, which are urged in its favour may be reduced to the two following: 1st. That the men who formed it, were wise and experienced; that they were an illustrious band of patriots, and had the happiness of their country at heart; that they were four months deliberating on the subject, and therefore, it must be a perfect system. 2d. That if the system be not received, this country will be without any government, and of consequence, will be reduced to a state of anarchy and confusion, and involved in bloodshed and carnage; and in the end, a government will be imposed upon us, not the result of reason and reflection, but of force and usurpation. As I do not find that either Cato or the Centinel, Brutus, or the Old Whig,1 or any other writer against this constitution, have undertaken a particular refutation of this new species of reasoning, I take the liberty of offering to the public, through the channel of your paper, the few following animadversions on the subject; and the rather, because I have discovered, that some of my fellow citizens have been imposed upon by it. With respect to the first, it will be readily perceived, that it precludes all investigation of the merits of the proposed constitution, and leads to an adoption of the plan, without enquiring whether it be good or bad. For if we are to infer the perfection of this system from the characters and abilities of the men who formed it, we may as well determine to accept it without any enquiry as with.—A number of persons in this as well as the other states, have, upon this principle, determined to submit to it without even reading or knowing its contents. But supposing the premisses from which this conclusion is drawn, to be just, it then becomes essential, in order to give validity to the argument, to enquire into the characters of those who composed this [192]body, that we may determine whether we can be justified in placing such unbounded confidence in them. It is an invidious task, to call in question the characters of individuals, especially of such as are placed in illustrious stations. But when we are required implicitly to submit our opinions to those of others, from a consideration that they are so wise and good as not to be liable to err, and that too in an affair which involves in it the happiness of ourselves and our posterity; every honest man will justify a decent investigation of characters in plain language. It is readily admitted, that many individuals who composed this body, were men of the first talents and integrity in the union. It is at the same time, well known to every man, who is but moderately acquainted with the characters of the members, that many of them are possessed of high aristocratic ideas, and the most sovereign contempt of the common people; that not a few were strongly disposed in favour of monarchy; that there were some of no small talents and of great influence, of consummate cunning, and masters of intrigue, whom the war found poor, or in embarrassed circumstances, and left with princely fortunes, acquired in public employment, who are at this day to account for many thousands of public money; that there were others who were young, ardent, and ambitious, who wished for a government corresponding with their feelings, while they were destitute of that experience which is the surest guide in political researches; that there were not a few who were gaping for posts of honour and emolument; these we find exulting in the idea of a change, which will divert places of honour, influence and emolument, into a different channel, where the confidence of the people, will not be necessary to their acquirement. It is not to be wondered at, that an assembly thus composed should produce a system liable to well founded objections, and which will require very essential alterations. We are told by one of themselves (Mr. Wilson of Philadelphia) the plan was matter of accommodation; and it is not unreasonable to suppose, that in this accommodation, principles might be introduced which would render the liberties of the people very insecure.2 I confess I think it of no importance, what are the characters of the framers of this government, and therefore should not have called them in question, if they had not been so often urged in print, and in conversation, in its favour. It ought to rest on its own intrinsic merit. If it is good, it is capable of being vindicated; if it is bad, it ought not to be supported. It is degrading to a freeman, and humiliating to a rational one, to pin his faith on the sleeve of any man, or body of men, in an affair of such momentous importance. [193 In answer to the second argument, I deny that we are in immediate danger of anarchy and commotions. Nothing but the passions of wicked and ambitious men, will put us in the least danger on this head: those who are anxious to precipitate a measure, will always tell us that the present is the critical moment; now is the time, the crisis is arrived, and the present minute must be seized. Tyrants have always made use of this plea; but nothing in our circumstances can justify it. The country is in profound peace, and we are not threatened by invasion from any quarter: the governments of the respective states are in the full exercise of their powers; and the lives, the liberty, and property of individuals are protected: all present exigencies are answered by them. It is true, the regulation of trade and a competent provision for the payment of the interest of the public debt is wanting; but no immediate commotion will arise from these; time may be taken for calm discussion and deliberate conclusions. Individuals are just recovering from the losses and embarrassments sustained by the late war; industry and frugality are taking their station, and banishing from the community, idleness and prodigality. Individuals are lessening their private debts, and several millions of the public debt is discharged by the sale of the western territory.3 There is no reason, therefore, why we should precipitately and rashly adopt a system, which is imperfect or insecure; we may securely deliberate and propose amendments and alterations. I know it is said we cannot change for the worse; but if we act the part of wise men, we shall take care that we change for the better: It will be labour lost, if after all our pains we are in no better circumstances than we were before. If any tumults arise, they will be justly chargeable on those artful and ambitious men, who are determined to cram this government down the throats of the people, before they have time deliberately to examine it. All the measures of the leaders of this faction have tended to this point. In Congress they attempted to obtain a resolution to approve the constitution, without going into an examination of it.4 In Pennsylvania, the chiefs of the party, who themselves were of the convention, that framed this system, within a few days after it dissolved, and before Congress had considered it, indecently brought forward a motion in their general assembly for recommending a convention; when a number of respectable men of that legislature, withdrew from the house, refusing to sanction with their presence, a measure so flagrantly improper, they procured a mob to carry a sufficient number of them by force to the house, to enable them to proceed on the business.5 In Boston, the printers have refused to print against this plan, and have been countenanced in it.6 In Connecticut, papers have been [194]handed about for the people to sign, to support it, and the names of those who decline signing it, have been taken down in what was called, a black list, to intimidate them into a compliance, and this before the people had time to read and understand the meaning of the constitution.7 Many of the members of the convention, who were charged with other public business, have abandoned their duty, and hastened to their states to precipitate an adoption of the measure. The most unwearied pains has been taken, to persuade the legislatures to recommend conventions to be elected to meet at early periods, before an opportunity could be had to examine the constitution proposed; every art has been used to exasperate the people against those, who made objections to the plan. They have been told that the opposition is chiefly made by state officers, who expect to lose their places by the change,8 though the propagators of this falsehood, know, that very few of the state offices will be vacated by the new constitution, and are well apprized, that should it take place, it will give birth to a vast number of more lucrative and permanent appointments, which its principal advocates in every state are warmly in the pursuit of. Is it not extraordinary, that those men who are predicting, that a rejection of this constitution will lead to every evil, which anarchy and confusion can produce, should at the same moment embrace and pursue with unabating industry, every measure in their power, to rouse the passions, and thereby preclude calm and dispassionate enquiry. It would be wise in them, however, to reflect in season that, should public commotion take place, they will not only be answerable for the consequences, and the blood that may be shed, but that on such an event, it is more than probable the people will discern the advocates for their liberties, from those who are aiming to enslave them, and that each will receive their just deserts."
Newspaper,No,A Son of Liberty,,New York Journal,A Slave,11/8/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, Having observed in your paper of the 25th ult. that a writer under the signature of A Slave, has pointed out a number of advantages or blessings, which, he says, will result from an adoption of the new government, proposed by the Convention:—I have taken the liberty to request, that you will give the following a place in your next paper, it being an enumeration of a few of the curses which will be entailed on the people of America, by this preposterous and newfangled system, if they are ever so infatuated as to receive it. 1st. A standing army, that bane to freedom, and support of tyrants, and their pampered minions; by which almost all the nations of Europe and Asia, have been enslaved. [135] 2d. An arbitrary capitation or poll tax, by which the poor, in general, will pay more than the rich, as they have, commonly, more children, than their wealthy dissipated neighbours. 3d. A suppression of trial by a jury of your peers, in all civil cases, and even in criminal cases, the loss of the trial in the vicinage, where the fact and the credibility of your witnesses are known, and where you can command their attendance without insupportable expence, or inconveniences. 4th. Men of all ranks and conditions, subject to have their houses searched by officers, acting under the sanction of general warrants, their private papers seized, and themselves dragged to prison, under various pretences, whenever the fear of their lordly masters shall suggest, that they are plotting mischief against their arbitrary conduct. 5th. Excise laws established, by which our bed chambers will be subjected to be searched by brutal tools of power, under pretence, that they contain contraband or smuggled merchandize, and the most delicate part of our families, liable to every species of rude or indecent treatment, without the least prospect, or shadow of redress, from those by whom they are commissioned. 6th. The Liberty of the Press (that grand palladium of our liberties) totally suppressed, with a view to prevent a communication of sentiment throughout the states. This restraint is designedly intended to give our new masters an opportunity to rivet our fetters the more effectually.(a) 7th. A swarm of greedy officers appointed, such as are not known at present in the United States, who will riot and fatten on the spoils of the people, and eat up their substance. 8th. The militia of New-Hampshire, or Massachusetts, dragged to Georgia or South-Carolina, to assist in quelling an insurrection of Negroes in those states; and those of Georgia, to another distant quarter, to subdue their fellow citizens, who dare to rise against the despotism of government. 9th. The citizens of the state of New-Hampshire or Georgia, obliged to attend a trial (on an appeal) at the seat of government, which will, probably, be at the distance of at least five hundred miles from the residence of one of the parties, by which means, the expence of suits will become so enormous as to render justice unattainable but by the rich. 10th. The states perpetually involved in the wars of Europe, to gratify the ambitious views of their ambitious rulers, by which the country will be continually drained of its men and money. 11th. The citizens constantly subjected to the insults of military collectors, who will, by the magnetism of that most powerful of all attractives, [136]the bayonet extract from their pockets (without their consent) the exorbitant taxes imposed on them by their haughty lords and masters, for the purpose of keeping them under, and breaking their spirits, to prevent revolt. 12th. Monopolies in trade, granted to the favourites of government, by which the spirit, of adventure will be destroyed, and the citizens subjected to the extortion of those companies who will have an exclusive right, to engross the different branches of commerce. 13th. An odious and detestable Stamp act, imposing duties on every instrument of writing, used in the courts of law and equity, by which the avenues to justice will, in a great measure, be barred, as it will enhance the expences on a suit, and deter men from pursuing the means requisite to obtain their right.—Stamp duties also, imposed on every commercial instrument of writing—on literary productions, and particularly, on news papers, which of course, will be a great discouragement to trade; an obstruction to useful knowledge in arts, sciences agriculture, and manufactures, and a prevention of political information throughout the states. Add to the above enumeration, the severest and most intolerable of all curses—that of being enslaved by men of our own creation (as to power) and for whose aggrandizement, many of us have fought and bled. Men who will, perhaps, construe our most innocent remarks and animadversions on their conduct, treason, misprision of treason, or high crimes and misdemeanours, which may be punished with unusual severity; we shall then be in a most forlorn and hopeless situation indeed. (a) The Abbé Mably, one of the most sensible writers on government says, that the most despotic monarch in any nation whatever, if he had as many troops as the ability of the nation could support, would not long hold the reins of government, if the press was not shackled to prevent political disquisition. Orange-County, November 4, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Cato,,New York Journal,,11/8/1787,"To the Citizens Of the State of New-York Admitting, however, that the vast extent of America, together with the various other reasons which I offered you in my last number,1 against the practicability of the just exercise of the new government are insufficient to convince you; still it is an undeniable truth, that its several parts are either possessed of principles, which you have heretofore considered as ruinous, and that others are omitted which you have established as fundamental to your political security, and must in their operation. I will venture to assert—fetter your tongues and minds, enchain your bodies, and ultimately extinguish all that is great and noble in man. In pursuance of my plan, I shall begin with observations on the executive branch of this new system; and though it is not the first in order, as arranged therein, yet being the chief, is perhaps entitled by the rules of rank to the first consideration. The executive power as described in the 2d article, consists of a president and vice-president, who are to hold their offices during the term of four years; the same article has marked the manner and time of their election, and established the qualifications of the president; it also provides against the removal, death, or inability of the president and vice-president—regulates the salary of the president, delineates his duties and powers; and lastly, declares the causes for which the president and vice-president shall be removed from office. [196] Notwithstanding the great learning and abilities of the gentlemen who composed the convention, it may be here remarked with deference, that the construction of the first paragraph of the first section of the second article, is vague and inexplicit, and leaves the mind in doubt, as to the election of a president and vice-president, after the expiration of the election for the first term of four years—in every other case, the election of these great officers is expressly provided for; but there is no explicit provision for their election in case of the expiration of their offices, subsequent to the election which is to set this political machine in motion—no certain and express terms as in your state constitution, that statedly once in every four years, and as often as these offices shall become vacant, by expiration or otherwise, as is therein expressed, an election shall be held as follows, &c.—this inexplicitness perhaps may lead to an establishment for life. It is remarked by Montesquieu, in treating of republics, that in all magistracies, the greatness of the power must be compensated by the brevity of the duration; and that a longer time than a year, would be dangerous.2 It is therefore obvious to the least intelligent mind, to account why, great power in the hands of a magistrate, and that power connected, with a considerable duration, may be dangerous to the liberties of a republic—the deposit of vast trusts in the hands of a single magistrate, enables him in their exercise, to create a numerous train of dependants—this tempts his ambition, which in a republican magistrate is also remarked, to be pernicious and the duration of his office for any considerable time favours his views, gives him the means and time to perfect and execute his designs—he therefore fancies that he may be great and glorious by oppressing his fellow citizens, and raising himself to permanent grandeur on the ruins of his country.3—And here it may be necessary to compare the vast and important powers of the president, together with his continuance in office with the foregoing doctrine—his eminent magisterial situation will attach many adherents to him, and he will be surrounded by expectants and courtiers—his power of nomination and influence on all appointments—the strong posts in each state comprised within his superintendance, and garrisoned by troops under his direction—his controul over the army, militia, and navy—the unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason, which may be used to screen from punishment, those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt—his duration in office for four years: these, and various other principles evidently prove the truth of the position—that if the president is possessed of ambition, he has power and time sufficient to ruin his country. Though the president, during the sitting of the legislature, is assisted by the senate, yet he is without a constitutional council in their recess—he will therefore be unsupported by proper information and advice, and will generally be directed by minions and favorites, or a council of state will grow out of the principal officers of the great departments, the most dangerous council in a free country. The ten miles square, which is to become the seat of government, will of course be the place of residence for the president and the great officers of state—the same observations of a great man will apply to the court of a president possessing the powers of a monarch, that is observed of that of a monarch—ambition with idleness—baseness with pride—the thirst of riches without labour—aversion to truth—flattery—treason—perfidy—violation of engagements—contempt of civil duties—hope from the magistrates weakness; but above all, the perpetual ridicule of virtue4—these, he remarks, are the characteristics by which the courts in all ages have been distinguished. The language and the manners of this court will be what distinguishes them from the rest of the community, not what assimilates them to it, and in being remarked for a behaviour that shews they are not meanly born, and in adulation to people of fortune and power. The establishment of a vice president is as unnecessary as it is dangerous. This officer, for want of other employment, is made president of the senate, thereby blending the executive and legislative powers, besides always giving to some one state, from which he is to come, an unjust pre-eminence. It is a maxim in republics, that the representative of the people should be of their immediate choice; but by the manner in which the president is chosen he arrives to this office at the fourth or fifth hand, nor does the highest votes, in the way he is elected, determine the choice—for it is only necessary that he should be taken from the highest of five, who may have a plurality of votes. Compare your past opinions and sentiments with the present proposed establishment, and you will find, that if you adopt it, that it will lead you into a system which you heretofore reprobated as odious. Every American whig, not long since, bore his emphatic testimony against a monarchical government, though limited, because of the dangerous inequality that it created among citizens as relative to their rights and property; and wherein does this president, invested with his powers and prerogatives, essentially differ from the king of Great-Britain (save as to name, the creation of nobility and some immaterial incidents, the offspring of absurdity and locality) the direct prerogatives of the president, [198]as springing from his political character, are among the following:—It is necessary, in order to distinguish him from the rest of the community, and enable him to keep, and maintain his court, that the compensation for his services; or in other words, his revenue should be such as to enable him to appear with the splendor of a prince; he has the power of receiving ambassadors from, and a great influence on their appointments to foreign courts; as also to make treaties, leagues, and alliances with foreign states, assisted by the senate, which when made, become the supreme law of the land: he is a constituent part of the legislative power; for every bill which shall pass the house of representatives and senate, is to be presented to him for approbation; if he approves of it, he is to sign it, if he disapproves, he is to return it with objections, which in many cases will amount to a compleat negative; and in this view he will have a great share in the power of making peace, coining money, &c. and all the various objects of legislation, expressed or implied in this Constitution: for though it may be asserted that the king of Great-Britain has the express power of making peace or war, yet he never thinks it prudent so to do without the advice of his parliament from whom he is to derive his support, and therefore these powers, in both president and king, are substantially the same: he is the generalissimo of the nation, and of course, has the command & controul of the army, navy and militia; he is the general conservator of the peace of the union—he may pardon all offences, except in cases of impeachment, and the principal fountain of all offices & employments. Will not the exercise of these powers therefore tend either to the establishment of a vile and arbitrary aristocracy, or monarchy? The safety of the people in a republic depends on the share or proportion they have in the government; but experience ought to teach you, that when a man is at the head of an elective government invested with great powers, and interested in his re-election, in what circle appointments will be made; by which means an imperfect aristocracy bordering on monarchy may be established. You must, however, my countrymen, beware, that the advocates of this new system do not deceive you, by a fallacious resemblance between it and your own state government, which you so much prize; and if you examine, you will perceive that the chief magistrate of this state, is your immediate choice, controuled and checked by a just and full representation of the people, divested of the prerogative of influencing war and peace, making treaties, receiving and sending embassies, and commanding standing armies and navies, which belong to the power of the confederation, and will be convinced that this government is no [199]more like a true picture of your own, than an Angel of darkness resembles an Angel of light."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/8/1787,"SIR, I have proved, sir, that not only some power is given in the constitution to restrain, and even to subject the press, but that it is a power totally unlimited; and may certainly annihilate the freedom of the press, and convert it from being the palladium of liberty to become an engine of imposition and tyranny. It is an easy step from restraining the press to making it place the worst actions of government in so favorable a light, that we may groan under tyranny and oppression without knowing from whence it comes. But you comfort us by saying,—“there is no reason to suspect so popular a privilege will be neglected.” The wolf, in the fable, said as much to the sheep, when he was persuading them to trust him as their protector, and to dismiss their guardian dogs.1 Do you indeed suppose, Mr. Wilson, that if the people give up their privileges to these new rulers they will render them back again to the people? Indeed, sir, you should not trifle upon a question so serious—You would not have us to suspect any ill. If we throw away suspicion—to be sure, the thing will go smoothly enough, and we shall deserve to continue a free, respectable, and happy people. Suspicion shackles rulers and prevents good government. All great and honest politicians, like yourself, have reprobated it. Lord Mansfield is a great authority against it, and has often treated it as the worst of libels.2 But such men as Milton. Sidney, Locke, Montesquieu, and Trenchard, have thought it essential to the preservation of liberty against the artful and persevering encroachments of those with whom power is trusted. You will pardon me, sir, if [200]I pay some respect to these opinions, and wish that the freedom of the press may be previously secured as a constitutional and unalienable right, and not left to the precarious care of popular privileges which may or may not influence our new rulers. You are fond of, and happy at, quaint expressions of this kind in your observation—that a formal declaration would have done harm, by implying, that some degree of power was given when we undertook to define its extent. This thought has really a brilliancy in it of the first water. But permit me, sir, to ask, why any saving clause was admitted into this constitution, when you tell us, every thing is reserved that is not expressly given? Why is it said in sec. 9th, “The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress, prior to the year, 1808.” There is no power expressly given to the Congress to prohibit migrations and importations. By your doctrine then they could have none, and it was, according to your own position, nugatory to declare they should not do it. Which are we to believe, sir,—you or the constitution? The text, or the comment. If the former, we must be persuaded, that in the contemplation of the framers of the constitution implied powers were given, otherwise the exception would have been an absurdity. If we listen to you we must affirm it to be a distinctive characteristic of the constitution, that—“what is not expressly given is reserved.” Such are the inconsistenc[i]es into which men over ingenuous, like yourself, are betrayed in advocating a bad cause. Perhaps four months more consideration of the subject, would have rendered you more guarded.3 I come now to the consideration of the trial by jury in civil cases. And here you have, indeed, made use of your professional knowledge—But you did not tell the people that your profession was always to advocate one side of a question—to place it in the most favorable, though false, light—to rail where you could not reason—to pervert where you could not refute—and to practice every fallacy on your hearers—to mislead the understanding and pervert judgment. In light of this professional practice, you make a refutable objection of your own, and then triumphantly refute it. The objection you impute to your opponents is—the trial by jury is abolished in civil cases. This you call a disingenuous form—and truly it is very much so on your part and of your own fabrication. The objection in its true form is, that—trial by jury is not secured in civil cases. To this objection, you could not possibly give an answer; you therefore ingenuously coined one to which you could make a plausible reply. We expected, and we had a right to expect, that such an inestimable privilege as this would have been secured [201]—that it would not have been left dependent on the arbitrary exposition of future judges, who, when it may suit the arbitrary views of the ruling powers will explain it away at pleasure. We may expect Tressellians, Jeffrees’s, and Mansfield’s here,4 and if they should not be native with us, they may possibly be imported. But, if taken even on your own ground it is not so clearly tenable. In point of legal construction, the trial by jury does seem to be taken away in civil cases. It is a law maxim, that the expression of one part is an exclusion of the other. In legal construction therefore, the reservation of trial by jury in criminal, is an exclusion of it in civil cases. Why else should it be mentioned at all? Either it followed of course in both cases, or it depended on being stipulated. If the first, then the stipulation was nugatory—if the latter, then it was in part given up. Therefore, either we must suppose the Convention did a nugatory thing; or that by the express mention of jury in criminal, they meant to exclude it in civil cases. And that they did intend to exclude it, seems the more probable, as in the appeal they have taken special care to render the trial by jury of no effect by expressly making the court judges both of law and fact. And though this is subjected to the future regulation of Congress, yet it would be absurd to suppose, that the regulation meant its annihilation. We must therefore conclude, that in appeals the trial by jury is expressly taken away, and in original process it is by legal implication taken away in all civil cases. Here then I must repeat—that you ought to have stated fairly to the people, that the trial by jury was not secured; that they might know what, it was they were to consent to; and if knowing it, they consented, the blame could not fall on you. Before they decide, however, I will take leave to lay before them the opinion of that great and revered Judge Lord Camden,5 whose authority is, I hope, at least equal to that of Mr. Wilson.—“There is, says he, scarce any matter of challenge allowed to the judge, but several to the jurors, and many of them may be removed without any reason alledged. This seems to promise as much impartiality as human nature will admit, and absolute perfection is not attainable, I am afraid, either in judge or jury or any thing else. The trial by our country, is in my opinion, the great bulwark of freedom, and for certain, the admiration of all foreign writers and nations. The last writer of any distinguished note, upon the principles of government, the celebrated Montesquieu, is in raptures with this peculiar perfection in the English policy. From juries running riot, if I may say so, and acting wildly at particular seasons, I cannot conclude, like some Scottish Doctors of our law and constitutions, that their power [202]should be lessened. This would, to use the words of the wise, learned, and intrepid Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, be—a strange newfangled conclusion, after a trial so celebrated for so many hundreds of years.”6 Such are the opinions of Lord Camden and Vaughan, and multitudes of the first names, both English and other foreigners might be cited, who bestow unbounded approbation on this best of all human modes for protecting, life, liberty, and property. I own then, it alarms me, when I see these Doctors of our constitutions cutting in twain this sacred shield of public liberty and justice. Surely my countrymen will think a little before they resign this strong hold of freedom. Our state constitutions have held it sacred in all its parts. They have anxiously secured it. But that these may not shield it from the intended destruction in the new constitution, it is therein as anxiously provided, that “this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme laws of the land; and the judges in every state, shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution and laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding.” Thus this new system, with one sweeping clause, bears down every constitution in the union, and establishes its arbitrary doctrines, supreme and paramount to all the bills and declarations of rights, in which we vainly put our trust, and on which we rested the security of our often declared, unalienable liberties. But I trust the whole people of this country, will unite, in crying out, as did our sturdy ancestors of old—Nolumus leges anglicæ mulari7—We will not part with our birthright."
Broadside,No,Federal Farmer,,,,11/8/1787,"LETTER I. October 8th, 1787. Dear Sir, My letters to you last winter, on the subject of a well-balanced national government for the United States, were the result of free enquiry; when I passed from that subject to enquiries relative to our commerce, revenues, past administration, &c. I anticipated the anxieties I feel, on carefully examining the plan of government proposed by the convention. It appears to be a plan retaining some federal features; but to be the first important step, and to aim strongly to one consolidated government of the United States. It leaves the powers of government, and the representation of the people, so unnaturally divided between the general and state governments, that the operations of our system must be very uncertain. My uniform federal attachments, and the interest I have in the protection of property, and a steady execution of the laws, will convince you, that, if I am under any biass at it,1 it is in favor of any general system which shall promise those advantages. The instability of our laws increase my wishes for firm and steady government; but then, I can consent to no government, which, in my opinion, is not calculated equally to preserve the rights of all orders of men in the community. My object has been to join with those who have endeavoured to supply the defects in the forms of our governments by a steady and proper administration of them. Though I have long apprehended that fraudulent debtors, and embarrassed men, on the one hand, and men, on the other, unfriendly to republican equality, would produce an uneasiness among the people, and prepare the way, not for cool and deliberate reforms in the governments, but for changes calculated to promote the interests of particular orders of [208]men. Acquit me, sir, of any agency in the formation of the new system; I shall be satisfied with seeing, if it should be adopted, a prudent administration. Indeed I am so much convinced of the truth of Pope’s maxim, that—“That which is best administered is best,”2 that I am much inclined to subscribe to it from experience. I am not disposed to unreasonably contend about forms. I know our situation is critical, and it behoves us to make the best of it. A federal government of some sort is necessary. We have suffered the present to languish; and whether the confederation was capable or not originally of answering any valuable purposes, it is now but of little importance. I will pass by the men, and states, who have been particularly instrumental in preparing the way for a change, and, perhaps, for governments not very favourable to the people at large. A constitution is now presented, which we may reject, or which we may accept, with or without amendments; and to which point we ought to direct our exertions, is the question. To determine this question, with propriety, we must attentively examine the system itself, and the probable consequences of either step. This I shall endeavour to do, so far as I am able, with candour and fairness; and leave you to decide upon the propriety of my opinions, the weight of my reasons, and how far my conclusions are well drawn. Whatever may be the conduct of others, on the present occasion, I do not mean, hastily and positively to decide on the merits of the constitution proposed. I shall be open to conviction, and always disposed to adopt that which, all things considered, shall appear to me to be most for the happiness of the community. It must be granted, that if men hastily and blindly adopt a system of government, they will as hastily and as blindly be led to alter or abolish it; and changes must ensue, one after another, till the peaceable and better part of the community will grow weary with changes, tumults and disorders, and be disposed to accept any government, however despotic, that shall promise stability and firmness. The first principal question that occurs, is, Whether, considering our situation, we ought to precipitate the adoption of the proposed constitution? If we remain cool and temperate, we are in no immediate danger of any commotions; we are in a state of perfect peace, and in no danger of invasions; the state governments are in the full exercise of their powers; and our governments answer all present exigencies, except the regulation of trade, securing credit, in some cases, and providing for the interest, in some instances, of the public debts; and whether we adopt a change, three or nine months hence, can make but little odds with the private circumstances of individuals; their happiness and prosperity, after all, depend principally upon their own exertions. We are hardly recovered from a long and distressing war: The [209]farmers, fishmen, &c. have not yet fully repaired the waste made by it. Industry and frugality are again assuming their proper station. Private debts are lessened, and public debts incurred by the war, have been, by various ways, diminished; and the public lands have now become a productive source for diminishing them much more. I know uneasy men, who wish very much to precipitate, do not admit all these facts; but they are facts well known to all men who are thoroughly informed in the affairs of this country. It must, however, be admitted, that our federal system is defective, and that some of the state governments are not well administered; but, then, we impute to the defects in our governments, many evils and embarrassments which are most clearly the result of the late war. We must allow men to conduct on the present occasion, as on all similar one’s. They will urge a thousand pretences to answer their purposes on both sides. When we want a man to change his condition, we describe it as miserable, wretched, and despised; and draw a pleasing picture of that which we would have him assume. And when we wish the contrary, we reverse our descriptions. Whenever a clamor is raised, and idle men get to work, it is highly necessary to examine facts carefully, and without unreasonably suspecting men of falshood, to examine, and enquire attentively, under what impressions they act. It is too often the case in political concerns, that men state facts not as they are, but as they wish them to be; and almost every man, by calling to mind past scenes, will find this to be true. Nothing but the passions of ambitious, impatient, or disorderly men, I conceive, will plunge us into commotions, if ⟨time should be taken fully to examine and consider the system proposed. Men who feel easy in their circumstances, and such as are not sanguine in their expectations relative to the consequences of the proposed change, will remain quiet under the existing governments. Many commercial and monied men, who are uneasy, not without just cause, ought to be respected; and, by no means, unreasonably disappointed in their expectations and hopes; but as to those who expect employments under the new constitution; as to those weak and ardent men who always expect to be gainers by revolutions, and whose lot it generally is to get out of one difficulty into another, they are very little to be regarded: and as to those who designedly avail themselves of this weakness and ardor, they are to be despised. It is natural for men, who wish to hasten the adoption of a measure, to tell us, now is the crisis—now is the critical moment which must be seized, or all will be lost: and to shut the door against free enquiry, whenever conscious the thing presented has defects in it, which time and investigation will probably discover. This has been the custom of tyrants and their dependants in all ages. If it is true, what has been so often said, that the people of this country cannot change [210]their condition for the worse, I presume it still behoves them to endeavour deliberately to change it for the better. The fickle and ardent, in any community, are the proper tools for establishing despotic government. But it is deliberate and thinking men, who must establish and secure governments on free principles. Before they decide on the plan proposed, they will enquire whether it will probably be a blessing or a curse to this people.⟩3 The present moment discovers a new face in our affairs. Our object has been all along, to reform our federal system, and to strengthen our governments—to establish peace, order and justice in the community—but a new object now presents. The plan of government now proposed, is evidently calculated totally to change, in time, our condition as a people. Instead of being thirteen republics, under a federal head, it is clearly designed to make us one consolidated government. Of this, I think, I shall fully convince you, in my following letters on this subject. This consolidation of the states has been the object of several men in this country for some time past. Whether such a change can ever be effected in any manner; whether it can be effected without convulsions and civil wars; whether such a change will not totally destroy the liberties of this country—time only can determine. To have a just idea of the government before us, and to shew that a consolidated one is the object in view, it is necessary not only to examine the plan, but also its history, and the politics of its particular friends. The confederation was formed when great confidence was placed in the voluntary exertions of individuals, and of the respective states; and the framers of it, to guard against usurpation, so limited and checked the powers, that, in many respects, they are inadequate to the exigencies of the union. We find, therefore, members of congress urging alterations in the federal system almost as soon as it was adopted. It was early proposed to vest congress with powers to levy an impost, to regulate trade, &c.4 but such was known to be the caution of the states in parting with power, that the vestment, even of these, was proposed to be under several checks and limitations. During the war, the general confusion, and the introduction of paper money, infused in the minds of people vague ideas respecting government and credit. We expected too much from the return of peace, and of course we have been disappointed. Our governments have been new and unsettled; and several legislatures, by making tender, suspension, and paper money laws, have given just cause of uneasiness to creditors. By these and other causes, several orders of men in the community have been prepared, by degrees, for a change of government; and this very abuse of power in the [211]legislatures, which, in some cases, has been charged upon the democratic part of the community, has furnished aristocratical men with those very weapons, and those very means, with which, in great measure, they are rapidly effecting their favourite object. And should an oppressive government be the consequence of the proposed change, posterity may reproach not only a few overbearing, unprincipled men, but those parties in the states which have misused their powers. The conduct of several legislatures, touching paper money, and tender laws, has prepared many honest men for changes in government, which otherwise they would not have thought of—when by the evils, on the one hand, and by the secret instigations of artful men, on the other, the minds of men were become sufficiently uneasy, a bold step was taken, which is usually followed by a revolution, or a civil war. A general convention for mere commercial purposes was moved for—the authors of this measure saw that the people’s attention was turned solely to the amendment of the federal system; and that, had the idea of a total change been started, probably no state would have appointed members to the convention. The idea of destroying, ultimately, the state government, and forming one consolidated system, could not have been admitted—a convention, therefore, merely for vesting in congress power to regulate trade, was proposed. This was pleasing to the commercial towns; and the landed people had little or no concern about it. September, 1786, a few men from the middle states met at Annapolis, and hastily proposed a convention to be held in May, 1787, for the purpose, generally, of amending the confederation—this was done before the delegates of Massachusetts, and of the other states arrived5—still not a word was said about destroying the old constitution, and making a new one—The states still unsuspecting, and not aware that, they were passing the Rubicon, appointed members to the new convention, for the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the confederation6—and, probably, not one man in ten thousand in the United States, till within these ten or twelve days, had an idea that, the old ship was to be destroyed, and he put to the alternative of embarking in the new ship presented, or of being left in danger of sinking—The States, I believe, universally supposed the convention would report alterations in the confederation, which would pass an examination in congress, and after being agreed to there, would be confirmed by all the legislatures, or be rejected. Virginia made a very respectable appointment, and placed at the head of it the first man in America:7—In this appointment there was a mixture of political characters; but Pennsylvania appointed principally those men who are esteemed aristocratical.8 Here the favourite moment for changing the [212]government was evidently discerned by a few men, who seized it with address. Ten other states appointed, and tho’ they chose men principally connected with commerce and the judicial department, yet they appointed many good republican characters—had they all attended we should now see, I am persuaded, a better system presented. The non-attendance of eight or nine men, who were appointed members of the convention, I shall ever consider as a very unfortunate event to the United States.9—Had they attended, I am pretty clear that the result of the convention would not have had that strong tendency to aristocracy now discernable in every part of the plan. There would not have been so great an accummulation of powers, especially as to the internal police of the country, in a few hands, as the constitution reported proposes to vest in them—the young visionary men, and the consolidating aristocracy, would have been more restrained than they have been. Eleven states10 met in the convention, and after four months close attention, presented the new constitution, to be adopted or rejected by the people. The uneasy and fickle part of the community may be prepared to receive any form of government; but, I presume, the enlightened and substantial part will give any constitution, presented for their adoption, a candid and thorough examination: and silence those designing or empty men, who weakly and rashly attempt to precipitate the adoption of a system of so much importance—We shall view the convention with proper respect—and, at the same time, that we reflect there were men of abilities and integrity in it, we must recollect how disproportionably the democratic and aristocratic parts of the community were represented.—Perhaps the judicious friends and opposers of the new constitution will agree, that it is best to let it rest solely on its own merits, or be condemned for its own defects.11 In the first place, I shall premise, that the plan proposed, is a plan of accommodation—and that it is in this way only, and by giving up a part of our opinions, that we can ever expect to obtain a government founded in freedom and compact. This circumstance candid men will always keep in view, in the discussion of this subject. The plan proposed appears to be partly federal, but principally however, calculated ultimately to make the states one consolidated government. The first interesting question, therefore, suggested, is, how far the states can be consolidated into one entire government on free principles. In considering this question extensive objects are to be taken into view, and important changes in the forms of government to be carefully attended to in all their consequences. The happiness of the people at [213]large must be the great object with every honest statesman, and he will direct every movement to this point. If we are so situated as a people, as not to be able to enjoy equal happiness and advantages under one government, the consolidation of the states cannot be admitted. There are three different forms of free government under which the United States may exist as one nation; and now is, perhaps, the time to determine to which we will direct our views. 1. Distinct republics connected under a federal head. In this case the respective state governments must be the principal guardians of the peoples rights, and exclusively regulate their internal police; in them must rest the balance of government. The congress of the states, or federal head, must consist of delegates amenable to, and removeable by the respective states: This congress must have general directing powers; powers to require men and monies of the states; to make treaties; peace and war; to direct the operations of armies, &c. Under this federal modification of government, the powers of congress would be rather advisary or recommendatory than coercive. 2. We may do away the several state governments, and form or consolidate all the states into one entire government, with one executive, one judiciary, and one legislature, consisting of senators and representatives collected from all parts of the union: In this case there would be a compleat consolidation of the states. 3. We may consolidate the states as to certain national objects, and leave them severally distinct independent republics, as to internal police generally. Let the general government consist of an executive, a judiciary and balanced legislature, and its powers extend exclusively to all foreign concerns, causes arising on the seas, to commerce, imports, armies, navies, Indian affairs, peace and war, and to a few internal concerns of the community; to the coin, post-offices, weights and measures, a general plan for the militia, to naturalization, and, perhaps to bankruptcies, leaving the internal police of the community, in other respects, exclusively to the state governments: as the administration of justice in all causes arising internally, the laying and collecting of internal taxes, and the forming of the militia according to a general plan prescribed. In this case there would be a compleat consolidation, quoad certain objects only. Touching the first, or federal plan, I do not think much can be said in its favor: The sovereignty of the nation, without coercive and efficient powers to collect the strength of it, cannot always be depended on to answer the purposes of government; and in a congress of representatives of foreign states, there must necessarily be an unreasonable mixture of powers in the same hands. [214] As to the second, or compleat consolidating plan, it deserves to be carefully considered at this time by every American: If it be impracticable, it is a fatal error to model our governments, directing our views ultimately to it. The third plan, or partial consolidation, is, in my opinion, the only one that can secure the freedom and happiness of this people. I once had some general ideas that the second plan was practicable, but from long attention, and the proceedings of the convention, I am fully satisfied, that this third plan is the only one we can with safety and propriety proceed upon. Making this the standard to point out, with candour and fairness, the parts of the new constitution which appear to be improper, is my object. The convention appears to have proposed the partial consolidation evidently with a view to collect all powers ultimately, in the United States into one entire government; and from its views in this respect, and from the tenacity, of the small states to have an equal vote in the senate, probably originated the greatest defects in the proposed plan. Independant of the opinions of many great authors, that a free elective government cannot be extended over large territories, a few reflections must evince, that one government and general legislation alone never can extend equal benefits to all parts of the United States: Different laws, customs, and opinions exist in the different states, which by a uniform system of laws would be unreasonably invaded. The United States contain about a million of square miles, and in half a century will, probably, contain ten millions of people; and from the center to the extremes is about 800 miles. Before we do away the state governments, or adopt measures that will tend to abolish them, and to consolidate the states into one entire government several principles should be considered and facts ascertained:—These, and my examination into the essential parts of the proposed plan, I shall pursue in my next. LETTER II. October 9, 1787. Dear Sir, The essential parts of a free and good government are a full and equal representation of the people in the legislature, and the jury trial of the vicinage in the administration of justice—a full and equal representation, is that which possesses the same interests, feelings, opinions, and views the people themselves would were they all assembled—a fair representation, therefore, should be so regulated, that every order of men in the community, according to the common [215]course of elections, can have a share in it—in order to allow professional men, merchants, traders, farmers, mechanics, &c. to bring a just proportion of their best informed men respectively into the legislature, the representation must be considerably numerous—We have about 200 state senators in the United States, and a less number than that of federal representatives cannot, clearly, be a full representation of this people, in the affairs of internal taxation and police, were there but one legislature for the whole union. The representation cannot be equal, or the situation of the people proper for one government only—if the extreme parts of the society cannot be represented as fully as the central—It is apparently impracticable that this should be the case in this extensive country—it would be impossible to collect a representation of the parts of the country five, six, and seven hundred miles from the seat of government. Under one general government alone, there could be but one judiciary, one supreme and a proper number of inferior courts. I think it would be totally impracticable in this case, to preserve a due administration of justice, and the real benefits of the jury trial of the vicinage—there are now supreme courts in each state in the union; and a great number of county and other courts subordinate to each supreme court—most of these supreme and inferior courts are itinerant, and hold their sessions in different parts every year of their respective states, counties and districts—with all these moving courts, our citizens, from the vast extent of the country must travel very considerable distances from home to find the place where justice is administered. I am not for bringing justice so near to individuals as to afford them any temptation to engage in law suits; though I think it one of the greatest benefits in a good government, that each citizen should find a court of justice within a reasonable distance, perhaps, within a day’s travel of his home; so that, without great inconveniences and enormous expences, he may have the advantages of his witnesses and jury—it would be impracticable to derive these advantages from one judiciary—the one supreme court at most could only set in the centre of the union, and move once a year into the centre of the eastern and southern extremes of it—and, in this case, each citizen, on an average, would travel 150 or 200 miles to find this court—that, however, inferior courts might be properly placed in the different counties, and districts of the union, the appellate jurisdiction would be intolerable and expensive. If it were possible to consolidate the states, and preserve the features of a free government, still it is evident that the middle states, the parts [216]of the union, about the seat of government, would enjoy great advantages, while the remote states would experience the many inconveniences of remote provinces. Wealth, officers, and the benefits of government would collect in the centre: and the extreme states; and their principal towns become much less important. There are other considerations which tend to prove that the idea of one consolidated whole, on free principles, is ill-founded—the laws of a free government rest on the confidence of the people, and operate gently—and never can extend their influence very far—if they are executed on free principles, about, the centre, where the benefits of the government induce the people to support it voluntarily; yet they must be executed on the principles of fear and force in the extremes—This has been the case with every extensive republic of which we have any accurate account. There are certain unalienable and fundamental rights, which in forming the social compact, ought to be explicitly ascertained and fixed—a free and enlightened people, in forming this compact, will not resign all their rights to those who govern, and they will fix limits to their legislators and rulers, which will soon be plainly seen by those who are governed, as well as by those who govern: and the latter will know they cannot be passed unperceived by the former, and without giving a general alarm—These rights should be made the basis of every constitution; and if a people be so situated, or have such different, opinions that they cannot agree in ascertaining and fixing them, it is a very strong argument against their attempting to form one entire society, to live under one system of laws only.—I confess, I never thought the people of these states differed essentially in these respects; they having derived all these rights, from one common source, the British systems; and having in the formation of their state constitutions, discovered that their ideas relative to these rights are very similar. However, it is now said that the states differ so essentially in these respects, and even in the important article of the trial by jury, that when assembled in convention, they can agree to no words by which to establish that trial, or by which to ascertain and establish many other of these rights, as fundamental articles in the social compact. If so, we proceed to consolidate the states on no solid basis whatever. But I do not pay much regard to the reasons given for not bottoming the new constitution on a better bill of rights. I still believe a complete federal bill of rights to be very practicable. Nevertheless I acknowledge the proceedings of the convention furnish my mind with many new and strong reasons, against a complete consolidation of the states. They [217]tend to convince me, that it cannot be carried with propriety very far—that the convention have gone much farther in one respect than they found it practicable to go in another; that is, they propose to lodge in the general government very extensive powers—powers nearly, if not altogether, complete and unlimited, over the purse and the sword. But, in its organization, they furnish the strongest proof that the proper limbs, or parts of a government, to support and execute those powers on proper principles (or in which they can be safely lodged) cannot be formed. These powers must be lodged somewhere in every society; but then they should be lodged where the strength and guardians of the people are collected. They can be wielded, or safely used, in a free country only by an able executive and judiciary, a respectable senate, and a secure, full, and equal representation of the people. I think the principles I have premised or brought into view, are well founded—I think they will not be denied by any fair reasoner. It is in connection with these, and other solid principles, we are to examine the constitution. It is not a few democratic phrases, or a few well formed features, that will prove its merits; or a few small omissions that will produce its rejection among men of sense; they will enquire what are the essential powers in a community, and what are nominal ones, where and how the essential powers shall be lodged to secure government, and to secure true liberty. In examining the proposed constitution carefully, we must clearly perceive an unnatural separation of these powers from the substantial representation of the people. The state governments will exist, with all their governors, senators, representatives, officers and expences; in these will be nineteen-twentieths of the representatives of the people; they will have a near connection, and their members an immediate intercourse with the people; and the probability is, that the state governments will possess the confidence of the people, and be considered generally as their immediate guardians. The general government will consist of a new species of executive, a small senate, and a very small house of representatives. As many citizens will be more than three hundred miles from the seat of this government as will be nearer to it, its judges and officers cannot be very numerous, without making our government very expensive. Thus will stand the state and the general governments, should the constitution be adopted without any alterations in their organization: but as to powers, the general government will possess all essential ones, at least on paper, and those of the states a mere shadow of power. And therefore, unless the people shall make some great exertions to restore to the [218]state governments their powers in matters of internal police; as the powers to lay and collect, exclusively, internal taxes, to govern the militia, and to hold the decisions of their own judicial courts upon their own laws final, the balance cannot possibly continue long; but the state governments must be annihilated, or continue to exist for no purpose. It is however to be observed, that many of the essential powers given the national government are not exclusively given; and the general government may have prudence enough to forbear the exercise of those which may still be exercised by the respective states. But this cannot justify the impropriety of giving powers, the exercise of which prudent men will not attempt, and imprudent men will, or probably can, exercise only in a manner destructive of free government. The general government, organized as it is, may be adequate to many valuable objects, and be able to carry its laws into execution on proper principles in several cases; but I think its warmest friends will not contend, that it can carry all the powers proposed to be lodged in it into effect, without calling to its aid a military force, which must very soon destroy all elective governments in the country, produce anarchy, or establish despotism. Though we cannot have now a complete idea of what will be the operations of the proposed system, we may, allowing things to have their common course, have a very tolerable one. The powers lodged in the general government, if exercised by it, must ultimately12 effect the internal police of the states, as well as external concerns; and there is no reason to expect the numerous state governments, and their connections, will be very friendly to the execution of federal laws in those internal affairs, which hitherto have been under their own immediate management. There is more reason to believe, that the general government, far removed from the people, and none of its members elected oftener than once in two years, will be forgot or neglected, and its laws in many cases disregarded, unless a multitude of officers and military force be continually kept in view, and employed to enforce the execution of the laws, and to make the government feared and respected. No position can be truer than this,—That in this country either neglected laws, or a military execution of them, must lead to a revolution, and to the destruction of freedom. Neglected laws must first lead to anarchy and confusion; and a military execution of laws is only a shorter way to the same point—despotic government. LETTER III. October 10th, 1787. Dear Sir, The great object of a free people must be so to form their government and laws and so to administer them as to create a [219]confidence in, and respect for the laws; and thereby induce the sensible and virtuous part of the community to declare in favor of the laws, and to support them without an expensive military force. I wish, though I confess I have not much hope, that this may be the case with the laws of Congress under the new Constitution. I am fully convinced that we must organize the national government on different principles, and make the parts of it more efficient, and secure in it more effectually the different interests in the community; or else leave in the state governments some powers proposed to be lodged in it—at least till such an organization shall be found to be practicable. Not sanguine in my expectations of a good federal administration, and satisfied, as I am, of the impracticability of consolidating the states, and at the same time of preserving the rights of the people at large, I believe we ought still to leave some of those powers in the state governments, in which the people, in fact, will still be represented—to define some other powers proposed to be vested in the general government, more carefully, and to establish a few principles to secure a proper exercise of the powers given it. It is not my object to multiply objections, or to contend about inconsiderable powers or amendments. ⟨I wish the system adopted with a few alterations; but those, in my mind, are essential ones; if adopted without, every good citizen will acquiesce,⟩13 though I shall consider the duration of our governments, and the liberties of this people, very much dependant on the administration of the general government. A wise and honest administration, may make the people happy under any government; but necessity only can justify even our leaving open avenues to the abuse of power, by wicked, unthinking, or ambitious men. I will examine, first, the organization of the proposed government in order to judge; 2d. with propriety, what powers are improperly, at least prematurely lodged in it. I shall examine, 3d, the undefined powers; and 4th, those powers, the exercise of which is not secured on safe and proper ground. First. As to the organization—the house of representatives, the democrative branch, as it is called, is to consist of 65 members; that is, about one representative for fifty thousand inhabitants, to be chosen biennially—the federal legislature may increase this number to one for every thirty thousand inhabitants, abating fractional numbers in each state.—Thirty-three representatives will make a quorum for doing business, and a majority of those present determine the sense of the house.—I have no idea that the interests, feelings, and opinions of three or four millions of people, especially touching internal taxation, can be collected in such a house.—In the nature of things, nine times in ten, men of elevated classes in the community only can be chosen—Connecticut, [220]for instance, will have five representatives—not one man in a hundred of those who form the democrative branch in the state legislature,14 will on a fair computation, be one of the five—The people of this country, in one sense, may all be democratic; but if we make the proper distinction between the few men of wealth and abilities, and consider them, as we ought, as the natural aristocracy of the country, and the great body of the people, the middle and lower classes, as the democracy, this federal representative branch will have but very little democracy in it, even this small representation is not secured on proper principles.—The branches of the legislature are essential parts of the fundamental compact, and ought to be so fixed by the people, that the legislature cannot alter itself by modifying the elections of its own members. This, by a part of Art. 1. Sect. 4. the general legislature may do, it may evidently so regulate elections as to secure the choice of any particular description of men.—It may make the whole state one district—make the capital, or any place in the state, the place or places of election—it may declare that the five men (or whatever the number may be the state may chuse) who shall have the most, votes shall be considered as chosen—In this case it is easy to perceive how the people who live scattered in the inland towns will bestow their votes on different men—and how few men in a city, in any order or profession, may unite and place any five men they please highest among those that may be voted for—and all this may be done constitutionally, and by those silent operations, which are not immediately perceived by the people in general.—I know it is urged, that the general legislature will be disposed to regulate elections on fair and just principles:—This may be true—good men will generally govern well with almost any constitution: But why in laying the foundation of the social system, need we unnecessarily have a door open to improper regulations?—This is a very general and unguarded clause, and many evils may flow from that part which authorises the congress to regulate elections—Were it omitted, the regulations of elections would be solely in the respective states, where the people are substantially represented; and where the elections ought to be regulated, otherwise to secure a representation from all parts of the community, in making the constitution, we ought to provide for dividing each state into a proper number of districts, and for confining the electors in each district to the choice of some men, who shall have a permanent interest and residence in it; and also for this essential object, that the representative elected shall have a majority of the votes of those electors who shall attend and give their votes. In considering the practicability of having a full and equal representation of the people from all parts of the union, not only distances and [221]different opinions, customs, and views, common in extensive tracts of country, are to be taken into view, but many differences peculiar to Eastern, Middle, and Southern States. These differences are not so perceivable among the members of congress, and men of general information in the state, as among the men who would properly form the democratic branch. The Eastern states are very democratic, and composed chiefly of moderate freeholders: they have but few rich men and no slaves; the Southern states are composed chiefly of rich planters and slaves; they have but few moderate freeholders, and the prevailing influence, in them, is generally a dissipated aristocracy: The Middle states partake partly of the Eastern, and partly of the Southern character. Perhaps, nothing could be more disjointed, unweildly and incompetent to doing business with harmony and dispatch, than a federal house of representatives properly numerous for the great objects of taxation, &c. collected from the several states; whether such men would ever act in concert; whether they would not worry along a few years, and then be the means of separating the parts of the union, is very problematical?—View this system in whatever form we can, propriety brings us still to this point, a federal government possessed of general and complete powers, as to those national objects which cannot well come under the cognizance of the internal laws of the respective states, and this federal government, accordingly, consisting of branches not very numerous. The house of representatives is on the plan of consolidation, but ⟨the senate is entirely on the federal plan;⟩15 and Delaware will have as much constitutional influence in the senate, as the largest state in the union; and in this senate are lodged legislative, executive and judicial powers: Ten states in this union urge that they are small states, nine of which were present in the convention.16—They were interested in collecting large powers into the hands of the senate, in which each state still will have its equal share of power. I suppose it was impracticable for the three large states, as they were called, to get the senate formed on any other principles:—But this only proves, that we cannot form one general government on equal and just principles—and proves, that we ought not to lodge in it such extensive powers before we are convinced of the practicability of organizing it on just and equal principles. The senate will consist of two members from each state, chosen by the state legislature, every sixth year. The clause referred to, respecting the elections of representatives, empowers the general legislature to regulate the elections of senators also, “except as to the places of chusing senators.”—There is, therefore, but little more security in the elections than in those of representatives:—Fourteen senators make a quorum [222]for business, and a majority of the senators present give the vote of the senate, except in giving judgment upon an impeachment, or in making treaties, or in expelling a member, when two thirds of the senators present must agree.—The members of the legislature are not excluded from being elected to any military offices, or any civil offices, except those created, or the emoluments of which shall be increased by themselves: two-thirds of the members present, of either house, may expel a member at pleasure.—The senate is an independent branch of the legislature, a court for trying impeachments, and also a part of the executive, having a negative in the making of all treaties, and in appointing almost all officers. The vice-president is not a very important, if not an unnecessary part of the system—he may be a part of the senate at one period, and act as the supreme executive magistrate at another—The election of this officer, as well as of the president of the United States seems to be properly secured;17 but when we examine the powers of the president, and the forms of the executive, shall perceive that the general government, in this part, will have a strong tendency to aristocracy, or the government of the few. The executive is, in fact, the president and senate in all transactions of any importance; the president is connected with, or tied to the senate; he may always act with the senate, never can effectually counteract its views: The president can appoint no officer, civil or military, who shall not be agreeable to the senate; and the presumption is, that the will of so important a body will not be very easily controuled, and that it will exercise its powers with great address. In the judicial department, powers ever kept distinct in well balanced governments, are no less improperly blended in the hands of the same men—in the judges of the supreme court is lodged, the law, the equity and the fact. It is not necessary to pursue the minute organical parts of the general government proposed.—There were various interests in the convention, to be reconciled, especially of large and small states; of carrying and non-carrying states: and of states more and states less democratic—vast laboured attention18 were by the convention bestowed on the organization of the parts of the constitution offered; still it is acknowledged, there are many things radically wrong in the essential parts of this constitution—but it is said, that these are the result of our situation:—On a full examination of the subject, I believe it; but what do the laborious inquiries and determinations of the convention prove? If they prove any thing, they prove that we cannot consolidate the states on proper principles: The organization of the government presented proves, that we cannot form a general government in which [223]all power can be safely lodged; and a little attention to the parts of the one proposed will make it appear very evident, that all the powers proposed to be lodged in it, will not be then well deposited, either for the purposes of government, or the preservation of liberty. I will suppose no abuse of powers in those cases, in which the abuse of it is not well guarded against—I will suppose the words authorising the general government to regulate the elections of its own members struck out of the plan, or free district elections, in each state, amply secured.—That the small representation provided for shall be as fair and equal as it is capable of being made—I will suppose the judicial department regulated on pure principles, by future laws, as far as it can be by the constitution, and consist with the situation of the country—still there will be an unreasonable accumulation of powers in the general government, if all be granted, enumerated in the plan proposed. The plan does not present a well balanced government: The senatorial branch of the legislative and the executive are substantially united, and the president, or the first executive magistrate, may aid the senatorial interest when weakest, but never can effectually support the democratic, however it may be oppressed;—the excellency, in my mind, of a well balanced government is that it consists of distinct branches, each sufficiently strong and independant to keep its own station, and to aid either of the other branches which may occasionally want aid. The convention found that any but a small house of representatives would be expensive, and that it would be impracticable to assemble a large number of representatives. Not only the determination of the convention in this case, but the situation of the states, proves the impracticability of collecting, in any one point, a proper representation. The formation of the senate, and the smallness of the house, being, therefore, the result of our situation, and the actual state of things, the evils which may attend the exercise of many powers in this national government may be considered as without a remedy. All officers are impeachable before the senate only—before the men by whom they are appointed, or who are consenting to the appointment of these officers. No judgment of conviction, on an impeachment, can be given unless two thirds of the senators agree. Under these circumstances the right of impeachment, in the house, can be of but little importance: the house cannot expect often to convict the offender; and, therefore, probably, will but seldom or never exercise the right. In addition to the insecurity and inconveniences attending this organization beforementioned, it may be observed, that it is extremely difficult to secure the people against the fatal effects of corruption and [224]influence. The power of making any law will be in the president, eight senators, and seventeen representatives, relative to the important objects enumerated in the constitution. Where there is a small representation a sufficient number to carry any measure, may, with ease, be influenced by bribes, offices and civilities; they may easily form private juntoes, and out-door meetings, agree on measures, and carry them by silent votes. Impressed, as I am, with a sense of the difficulties there are in the way of forming the parts of a federal government on proper principles, and seeing a government so unsubstantially organized, after so arduous an attempt has been made, I am led to believe, that powers ought to be given to it with great care and caution. In the second place it is necessary, therefore, to examine the extent, and the probable operations of some of those extensive powers proposed to be vested in this government. These powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, respect internal as well as external objects. Those respecting external objects, as all foreign concerns, commerce, impost, all causes arising on the seas, peace and war, and Indian affairs, can be lodged no where else, with any propriety, but in this government. Many powers that respect internal objects ought clearly to be lodged in it; as those to regulate trade between the states, weights and measures, the coin or current monies, post-offices, naturalization, &c. These powers may be exercised without essentially effecting the internal police of the respective states: But powers to lay and collect internal taxes, to form the militia, to make bankrupt laws, and to decide on appeals, questions arising on the internal laws of the respective states, are of a very serious nature, and carry with them almost all other powers. These taken in connection with the others, and powers to raise armies and build navies, proposed to be lodged in this government, appear to me to comprehend all the essential powers in the community, and those which will be left to the states will be of no great importance. A power to lay and collect taxes at discretion, is, in itself, of very great importance. By means of taxes, the government may command the whole or any part of the subject’s property. Taxes may be of various kinds; but there is a strong distinction between external and internal taxes. External taxes are impost duties, which are laid on imported goods; they may usually be collected in a few seaport towns, and of a few individuals, though ultimately paid by the consumer; a few officers can collect them, and they can be carried no higher than trade will bear, or smuggling permit—that in the very nature of commerce bounds are set to them. But internal taxes, as poll and land taxes, [225]excise, duties on all written instruments, &c. may fix themselves on every person and species of property in the community; they may be carried to any lengths, and in proportion as they are extended, numerous officers must be employed to assess them, and to enforce the collection of them. In the United Netherlands the general government has compleat powers, as to external taxation; but as to internal taxes, it makes requisitions on the provinces. Internal taxation in this country is more important, as the country is so very extensive. As many assessors and collectors of federal taxes will be above three hundred miles from the seat of the federal government as will be less. Besides, to lay and collect internal taxes, in this extensive country, must require a great number of congressional ordinances, immediately operating upon the body of the people; these must continually interfere with the state laws, and thereby produce disorder and general dissatisfaction, till the one system of laws or the other, operating upon the same subjects, shall be abolished. These ordinances alone, to say nothing of those respecting the militia, coin, commerce, federal judiciary, &c. &c. will probably soon defeat the operations of the state laws and governments. Should the general government think it politic, as some administrations (if not all) probably will, to look for a support in a system of influence, the government will take every occasion to multiply laws, and officers to execute them, considering these as so many necessary props for its own support. Should this system of policy be adopted, taxes more productive than the impost duties will, probably, be wanted to support the government, and to discharge foreign demands, without leaving any thing for the domestic creditors. The internal sources of taxation then must be called into operation, and internal tax laws and federal assessors and collectors spread over this immense country. All these circumstances considered, is it wise, prudent, or safe, to vest the powers of laying and collecting internal taxes in the general government, while imperfectly organized and inadequate; and to trust to amending it hereafter, and making it adequate to this purpose? It is not only unsafe but absurd to lodge power in a government before it is fitted to receive it? It is confessed that this power and representation ought to go together. Why give the power first? Why give the power to the few, who, when possessed of it, may have address enough to prevent the increase of representation? Why not keep the power, and, when necessary, amend the constitution, and add to its other parts this power, and a proper increase of representation at the same time? Then men who may want the power will be under strong inducements to let in the people, by their representatives, into the government, to hold their [226]due proportion of this power. If a proper representation be impracticable, then we shall see this power resting in the states, where it at present ought to be, and not inconsiderately given up. When I recollect how lately congress, convention, legislatures, and people, contended in the cause of liberty, and carefully weighed the importance of taxation, I can scarcely believe we are serious in proposing to vest the powers of laying and collecting internal taxes in a government so imperfectly organized for such purposes. Should the United States be taxed by a house of representatives of two hundred members, which would be about fifteen members for Connecticut, twenty-five for Massachusetts, &c. still the middle and lower classes of people could have no great share, in fact, in taxation. I am aware it is said, that the representation proposed by the new constitution is sufficiently numerous; it may be for many purposes; but to suppose that this branch is sufficiently numerous to guard the rights of the people in the administration of the government, in which the purse and sword is placed, seems to argue that we have forgot what the true meaning of representation is. I am sensible also, that it is said that congress will not attempt to lay and collect internal taxes; that it is necessary for them to have the power, though it cannot probably be exercised.—I admit that it is not probable that any prudent congress will attempt to lay and collect internal taxes, especially direct taxes: but this only proves, that the power would be improperly lodged in congress, and that it might be abused by imprudent and designing men. I have heard several gentlemen, to get rid of objections to this part of the constitution, attempt to construe the powers relative to direct taxes, as those who object to it would have them; as to these, it is said, that congress will only have power to make requisitions, leaving it to the states to lay and collect them. I see but very little colour for this construction, and the attempt only proves that this part of the plan cannot be defended. By this plan there can be no doubt, but that the powers of congress will be complete as to all kind of taxes whatever—Further, as to internal taxes, the state governments will have concurrent powers with the general government, and both may tax the same objects in the same year; and the objection that the general government may suspend a state tax, as a necessary measure for the promoting the collection of a federal tax, is not without foundation.—As the states owe large debts, and have large demands upon them individually, there clearly would be a propriety in leaving in their possession exclusively, some of the internal sources of taxation, at least until the federal representation shall be properly encreased: The power in the general government [227]to lay and collect internal taxes, will render its powers respecting armies, navies and the militia, the more exceptionable. By the constitution it is proposed that congress shall have power “to raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years; to provide and maintain a navy; to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union; suppress insurrections, and repel invasions: to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia: reserving to the states the right to appoint the officers, and to train the militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress;” congress will have unlimited power to raise armies, and to engage officers and men for any number of years; but a legislative act applying money for their support can have operation for no longer term than two years, and if a subsequent congress do not within the two years renew the appropriation, or further appropriate monies for the use of the army, the army, will be left to take care of itself. When an army shall once be raised for a number of years, it is not probable that it will find much difficulty in getting congress to pass laws for applying monies to its support. I see so many men in America ford of a standing army, and especially among those who probably will have a large share in administering the federal system; it is very evident to me, that we shall have a large standing army as soon as the monies to support them can be possibly found. An army is a very agreeable place of employment for the young gentlemen of many families. A power to raise armies must be lodged some where; still this will not justify the lodging this power in a bare majority of so few men without any checks; or in the government in which the great body of the people, in the nature of things, will be only nominally represented. In the state governments the great body of the people, the yeomanry. &c. of the country, are represented: It is true they will chuse the members of congress, and may now and then chuse a man of their own way of thinking; but it is impossible for forty, or thirty thousand people in this country, one time in ten to find a man who can possess similar feeling, views, and interests with themselves: powers to lay and collect taxes and to raise armies are of the greatest moment; for carrying them into effect, laws need not be frequently made, and the yeomanry, &c. of the country ought substantially to have a check upon the passing of these laws; this check ought to be placed in the legislatures, or at least, in the few men the common people of the country, will, probably, have in congress, in the true sense of the word, “from among themselves.” It is true, the yeomanry of the country possess the lands, the weight of properly, possess arms, and are too strong a body of men to be openly [228]offended—and, therefore, it is urged, they will take care of themselves, that men who shall govern will not dare pay any disrespect to their opinions. It is easily perceived, that if they have not their proper negative upon passing laws in congress, or on the passage of laws relative to taxes and armies, they may in twenty or thirty years be by means imperceptible to them, totally deprived of that boasted weight and strength: This may be done in a great measure by congress, if disposed to do it, by modelling the militia. Should one fifth, or one eighth part of the men capable of bearing arms, be made a select militia, as has been proposed, and those the young and ardent part of the community, possessed of but little or no property, and all the others put upon a plan that will render them of no importance, the former will answer all the purposes of an army, while the latter will be defenceless. The state must train the militia in such form and according to such systems and rules as Congress shall prescribe: and the only actual influence the respective states will have respecting the militia will be in appointing the officers. I see no provision made for calling out the posse commitatus for executing the laws of the union, but provision is made for Congress to call forth the militia for the execution of them—and the militia in general, or any select part of it, may be called out under military officers, instead of the sheriff to enforce an execution of federal laws, in the first instance and thereby introduce an entire military execution of the laws.19 I Know that powers to raise taxes, to regulate the military strength of the community on some uniform plan, to provide for its defence and internal order, and for duly executing the laws, must be lodged somewhere; but still we ought not to lodge them, as evidently to give one another of them in the community, undue advantages over others; or commit the many to the mercy, prudence, and moderation of the few. And so far as it may be necessary to lodge any of the peculiar powers in the general government, a more safe exercise of them ought to be secured, by requiring the consent of two-thirds or three-fourths of Congress thereto—until the federal representation can be increased, so that the democratic members in Congress may stand some tolerable chance of a reasonable negative, in behalf of the numerous, important, and democratic part of the community. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the laws and internal police of all the states to discern fully, how general bankrupt laws, made by the union, would effect them, or promote the public good. I believe the property of debtors, in the several states, is held responsible for their debts in modes and forms very different. If uniform bankrupt laws can be made without producing real and substantial inconveniences, I wish them to be made by Congress. There are some powers proposed to be lodged in the general government in the judicial department, I think very unnecessarily, I mean powers respecting questions arising upon the internal laws of the respective states. It is proper the federal judiciary should have powers coextensive with the federal legislature—that is, the power of deciding finally on the laws of the union. By Art. 3. Sect. 2. the powers of the federal judiciary are extended (among other things) to all cases between a state and citizens of another state—between citizens of different states—between a state or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects. Actions in all these cases, except against a state government, are now brought and finally determined in the law courts of the states respectively; and as there are no words to exclude these courts of their jurisdiction in these cases, they will have concurrent jurisdiction with the inferior federal courts in them; and, therefore, if the new constitution be adopted without any amendment in this respect, all those numerous actions, now brought in the state courts between our citizens and foreigners, between citizens of different states, by state governments against foreigners, and by state governments against citizens of other states, may also be brought in the federal courts; and an appeal will lay in them from the state courts, or federal inferior courts, to the supreme judicial court of the union. In almost all these cases, either party may have the trial by jury in the state courts; excepting paper money and tender laws, which are wisely guarded against in the proposed constitution; justice may be obtained in these courts on reasonable terms; they must be more competent to proper decisions on the laws of their respective states, than the federal courts can possibly be. I do not, in any point of view, see the need of opening a new jurisdiction to these causes—of opening a new scene of expensive law suits—of suffering foreigners, and citizens of different states, to drag each other many hundred miles into the federal courts. It is true, those courts may be so organized by a wise and prudent legislature, as to make the obtaining of justice in them tolerably easy; they may in general be organized on the common law principles of the country: But this benefit is by no means secured by the constitution. The trial by jury is secured only in those few criminal cases, to which the federal laws will extend—as crimes committed on the seas against the laws of nations, treason and counterfeiting the federal securities and coin: But even in these cases, the jury trial of the vicinage is not secured, particularly in the large states, a citizen may be tried for a crime committed in the state, and yet tried in some states 500 miles from the place where it was committed; but the jury trial is not secured at all in civil causes. Though the convention have not established this [230]trial, it is to be hoped that congress, in putting the new system into execution, will do it by a legislative act, in all cases in which it can be done with propriety. Whether the jury trial is not excluded [in] the supreme judicial court, is an important question. By Art. 3. Sect. 2. all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and in those cases in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exception, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make. By court is understood a court consisting of judges; and the idea of a jury is excluded. This court, or the judges, are to have jurisdiction on appeals, in all the cases enumerated, as to law and fact; the judges are to decide the law and try the fact, and the trial of the fact being assigned to the judges by the constitution, a jury for trying the fact is excluded; however, under the exceptions and powers to make regulations, Congress may, perhaps, introduce the jury, to try the fact in most necessary cases. There can be but one supreme court in which the final jurisdiction will centre in all federal causes—except in cases where appeals by law shall not be allowed: The judicial powers of the federal courts extends in law and equity to certain cases: and, therefore, the powers to determine on the law, in equity, and as to the fact, all will concentre in the supreme court:—These powers, which by this constitution are blended in the same hands, the same judges, are in Great-Britain deposited in different hands—to wit, the decision of the law in the law judges, the decision in equity in the chancellor, and the trial of the fact in the jury. It is a very dangerous thing to vest in the same judge power to decide on the law, and also general powers in equity; for if the law restrain him, he is only to step into his shoes of equity, and give what judgment his reason or opinion may dictate; we have no precedents in this country, as yet, to regulate the divisions as in equity in Great-Britain; equity, therefore, in the supreme court for many years, will be mere discretion. I confess in the constitution of the supreme court, as left by the constitution, I do not see a spark of freedom or a shadow of our own or the British common law. This court is to have appellate jurisdiction in all the other cases before mentioned: Many sensible men suppose that cases before-mentioned respect, as well the criminal cases as the civil ones, mentioned antecedently in the constitution, if so an appeal is allowed in criminal cases—contrary to the usual sense of law. How far it may be proper to admit a foreigner or the citizen of another state to bring actions against state governments, which have failed in performing so many promises [231]made during the war, is doubtful: How far it may be proper so to humble a state, as to bring20 it to answer to an individual in a court of law, is worthy of consideration; the states are now subject to no such actions; and this new jurisdiction will subject the states. and many defendants to actions, and processes, which were not in the contemplation of the parties, when the contract was made; all engagements existing between citizens of different states, citizens and foreigners, states and foreigners; and states and citizens of other states were made the parties contemplating the remedies then existing on the laws of the states—and the new remedy proposed to be given in the federal courts, can be founded on no principle whatever. LETTER IV. October 12th, 1787. Dear Sir, It will not be possible to establish in the federal courts the jury trial of the vicinage so well as in the state courts. Third. There appears to me to be not only a premature deposit of some important powers in the general government—but many of those deposited there are undefined, and may be used to good or bad purposes as honest or designing men shall prevail. By Art. 1, Sect. 2, representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, &c.—same art. sect. 8, the Congress shall have powers to lay and collect taxes, duties, &c. for the common defence and general welfare. but all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States: By the first recited clause, direct taxes shall be apportioned on the states. This seems to favour the idea suggested by some sensible men and writers, that Congress, as to direct taxes, will only have power to make requisitions; but the latter clause, power to21 tax immediately individuals, without the intervention of the state legislatures[;] in fact the first clause appears to me only to provide that each state shall pay a certain portion of the tax, and the latter to provide that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, that is to assess upon, and to collect of the individuals in the state, the states quota; but these still I consider as undefined powers, because judicious men understand them differently. It is doubtful whether the vice president is to have any qualifications; none are mentioned; but he may serve as president, and it may be inferred, he ought to be qualified therefore as the president; but the qualifications of the president are required only of the person to be elected president. By art. the 2, sect. 2. “But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of the departments:” [232]Who are inferior officers? May not a Congress disposed to vest the appointment of all officers in the president, under this clause, vest the appointment of almost every officer in the president alone, and destroy the check mentioned in the first part of the clause, and lodged in the senate. It is true, this check is badly lodged, but then some check upon the first magistrate in appointing officers, ought, it appears by the opinion of the convention, and by the general opinion, to be established in the constitution. By art. 3, sect. 2, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction as to law and facts with such exceptions, &c. to what extent it is intended the exceptions shall be carried—Congress may carry them so far as to annihilate substantially the appellate jurisdiction, and the clause be rendered of very little importance. 4th. There are certain rights which we have always held sacred in the United States, and recognized in all our constitutions, and which, by the adoption of the new constitution, its present form will be left unsecured. By article 6, the proposed constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. It is to be observed that when the people shall adopt the proposed constitution it will be their last and supreme act; it will be adopted not by the people of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, &c. but by the people of the United States; and whenever this constitution, or any part of it, shall be incompatible with the antient customs, rights, the laws or the constitutions heretofore established in the United States, it will entirely abolish them and do them away: And not only this, but the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance of the federal constitution will be also supreme laws, and whenever they shall be incompatible with those customs, rights, laws or constitutions heretofore established, they will also entirely abolish them and do them away. By the article before recited, treaties also made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law: It is not said that these treaties shall be made in pursuance of the constitution—nor are there any constitutional bounds set to those who shall make them: The president and two thirds of the senate will be empowered to make treaties indefinitely, and when these treaties shall be made, they will also abolish all laws and state constitutions incompatible with them. This power in the president and senate is absolute, and the judges will be bound to allow full force to whatever rule, article or thing the president and senate shall establish by treaty, whether it be practicable to set any [233]bounds to those who make treaties, I am not able to say: If not, it proves that this power ought to be more safely lodged. The federal constitution, the laws of congress made in pursuance of the constitution, and all treaties must have full force and effect in all parts of the United States; and all other laws, rights and constitutions which stand in their way must yield: It is proper the national laws should be supreme, and superior to state or district laws; but then the national laws ought to yield to alienable22 or fundamental rights—and national laws, made by a few men, should extend only to a few national objects. This will not be the case with the laws of congress: To have any proper idea of their extent, we must carefully examine the legislative, executive and judicial powers proposed to be lodged in the general government, and consider them in connection with a general clause in art. 1. sect. 8. in these words (after enumerating a number of powers) “To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.”—The powers of this government as has been observed, extend to internal as well as external objects, and to those objects to which all others are subordinate; it is almost impossible to have a just conception of these powers, or of the extent and number of the laws which may be deemed necessary and proper to carry them into effect, till we shall come to exercise those powers and make the laws. In making laws to carry those powers into effect, it will be expected, that a wise and prudent congress will pay respect to the opinions of a free people, and bottom their laws on those principles which have been considered as essential and fundamental in the British, and in our government: But a congress of a different character will not be bound by the constitution to pay respect to those principles. It is said, that when the people make a constitution, and delegate powers, that all powers not delegated by them to those who govern, is reserved in the people; and that the people, in the present case, have reserved in themselves. and in there state governments, every right and power not expressly given by the federal constitution to those who shall administer the national government. It is said, on the other hand, that the people, when they make a constitution, yield all power not expressly reserved to themselves. The truth is, in either case, it is mere matter of opinion, and men usually take either side of the argument, as will best answer their purposes: But the general presumption being, that men who govern, will, in doubtful cases, construe laws and constitutions most favourably for encreasing their own powers; all wise and prudent people, in forming constitutions, have drawn the line, and carefully [234]described the powers parted with and the powers reserved. By the state constitutions, certain rights have been reserved in the people; or rather, they have been recognized and established in such a manner, that state legislatures are bound to respect them, and to make no laws infringing upon them. The state legislatures are obliged to take notice of the bills of rights of their respective states. The bills of rights, and the state constitutions, are fundamental compacts only between those who govern, and the people of the same state. In the year 1788 the people of the United States make a federal constitution, which is a fundamental compact between them and their federal rulers; these rulers, in the nature of things, cannot be bound to take notice of any other compact. It would be absurd for them, in making laws, to look over thirteen, fifteen, or twenty state constitutions, to see what rights are established as fundamental, and must not be infringed upon, in making laws in the society. It is true, they would be bound to do it if the people, in their federal compact, should refer to the state constitutions, recognize all parts not inconsistent with the federal constitution, and direct their federal rulers to take notice of them accordingly; but this is not the case, as the plan stands proposed at present; and it is absurd, to suppose so unnatural an idea is intended or implied, I think my opinion is not only founded in reason, but I think it is supported by the report of the convention itself. If there are a number of rights established by the state constitutions, and which will remain sacred, and the general government is bound to take notice of them—it must take notice of one as well as another; and if unnecessary to recognize or establish one by the federal constitution, it would be unnecessary to recognize or establish another by it. If the federal constitution is to be construed so far in connection with the state constitutions, as to leave the trial by jury in civil causes, for instance, secured; on the same principles it would have left the trial by jury in criminal causes, the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, &c. secured; they all stand on the same footing; they are the common rights of Americans, and have been recognized by the state constitutions: But the convention found it necessary to recognize or re-establish the benefits of that writ, and the jury trial in criminal cases. As to expost facto laws, the convention has done the same in one case, and gone further in another. It is a part of the compact between the people of each state and the rulers, that no expost facto laws shall be made. But the convention, by Art. 1. Sect. 10. have put a sanction upon this part even of the state compacts. In fact, the 9th and 10th Sections in Art. 1. in the proposed constitution, are no more nor less, than a partial bill of rights; [235]they establish certain principles as part of the compact upon which the federal legislators and officers can never infringe. It is here wisely stipulated, that the federal legislature shall never pass a bill of attainder, or expost facto law; that no tax shall be laid on articles exported, &c. The establishing of one right implies the necessity of establishing another and similar one. On the whole, the position appears to me to be undeniable, that this bill of rights ought to be carried farther, and some other principles established, as a part of this fundamental compact between the people of the United States and their federal rulers. It is true, we are not disposed to differ much, at present, about religion; but when we are making a constitution, it is to be hoped, for ages and millions yet unborn, why not establish the free exercise of religion, as a part of the national compact. There are other essential rights, which we have justly understood to be the rights of freemen; as freedom from hasty and unreasonable search warrants, warrants not founded on oath, and not issued with due caution, for searching and seizing men’s papers, property, and persons. The trials by jury in civil causes, it is said, varies so much in the several states, that no words could be found for the uniform establishment of it. If so the federal legislation will not be able to establish it by any general laws. I confess I am of opinion it may be established, but not in that beneficial manner in which we may enjoy it, for the reasons beforementioned. When I speak of the jury trial of the vicinage, or the trial of the fact in the neighbourhood,—I do not lay so much stress upon the circumstance of our being tried by our neighbours: in this enlightened country men may be probably impartially tried by those who do not live very near them: but the trial of facts in the neighbourhood is of great importance in other respects. Nothing can be more essential than the cross examining witnesses, and generally before the triers of the facts in question. The common people can establish facts with much more ease with oral than written evidence; when trials of facts are removed to a distance from the homes of the parties and witnesses, oral evidence becomes intolerably expensive, and the parties must depend on written evidence, which to the common people is expensive and almost useless; it must be frequently taken ex-parte, and but very seldom leads to the proper discovery of truth. The trial by jury is very important in another point of view. It is essential in every free country, that common people should have a part and share of influence, in the judicial as well as in the legislative department. To hold open to them the offices of senators, judges, and [236]officers to fill which an expensive education is required, cannot answer any valuable purposes for them; they are not in a situation to be brought forward and to fill those offices; these, and most other offices of any considerable importance, will be occupied by the few. The few, the well born, &c. as Mr. Adams calls them,23 in judicial decisions as well as in legislation, are generally disposed, and very naturally too, to favour those of their own description. The trial by jury in the judicial department, and the collection of the people by their representatives in the legislature, are those fortunate inventions which have procured for them in this country, their true proportion of influence, and the wisest and most fit means of protecting themselves in the community. Their situation, as jurors and representatives, enables them to acquire information and knowledge in the affairs and government of the society; and to come forward, in turn, as the centinels and guardians of each other. I am very sorry that even a few of our countrymen should consider jurors and representatives in a different point of view, as ignorant, troublesome bodies, which ought not to have any share in the concerns of government. I confess I do not see in what cases the Congress can, with any pretence of right, make a law to suppress the freedom of the press; though I am not clear, that Congress is restrained from laying any duties whatever on printing and from laying duties particularly heavy on certain pieces printed, and perhaps Congress may require large bonds for the payment of these duties. Should the printer say, the freedom of the press was secured by the constitution of the state in which he lived, Congress might, and perhaps, with great propriety, answer, that the federal constitution is the only compact existing between them and the people; in this compact the people have named no others, and therefore Congress, in exercising the powers assigned them, and in making laws to carry them into execution, are restrained by nothing beside the federal constitution, any more than a state legislature is restrained by a compact between the magistrates and people of a county, city, or town of which the people, in forming the state constitution, have taken no notice. It is not my object to enumerate rights of inconsiderable importance; but there are others, no doubt, which ought to be established as a fundamental part of the national system. It is worthy of observation, that all treaties are made by foreign nations with a confederacy of thirteen states—that the western country is attached to thirteen states—thirteen states have jointly and severally engaged to pay the public debts.—Should a new government be formed of nine, ten, eleven, or twelve states, those treaties could not be considered as binding on the foreign nations who made them. However, [237]I believe the probability to be, that if nine states adopt the constitution, the others will. It may also be worthy our examination, how far the provision for amending this plan, when it shall be adopted, is of any importance. No measures can be taken towards amendments, unless two-thirds of the Congress, or two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states shall agree.—While power is in the hands of the people, or democratic part of the community, more especially as at present, it is easy, according to the general course of human affairs, for the few influential men in the community, to obtain conventions, alterations in government, and to persuade the common people they may change for the better, and to get from them a part of the power: But when power is once transferred from the many to the few, all changes become extremely difficult; the government, in this case, being beneficial to the few, they will be exceedingly artful and adroit in preventing any measures which may lead to a change; and nothing will produce it, but great exertions and severe struggles on the part of the common people. Every man of reflection must see, that the change now proposed, is a transfer of power from the many to the few, and the probability is, the artful and ever active aristocracy, will prevent all peaceable measures for changes, unless when they shall discover some favorable moment to increase their own influence. I am sensible, thousands of men in the United States, are disposed to adopt the proposed constitution, though they perceive it to be essentially defective, under an idea that amendment of it, may be obtained when necessary. This is a pernicious idea, it argues a servility of character totally unfit for the support of free government; it is very repugnant to that perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, so absolutely necessary in all free states, spoken of by Mr. Dickinson.24—However, if our countrymen are so soon changed, and the language of 1774, is become odious to them, it will be in vain to use the language of freedom, or to attempt to rouse them to free enquiries: But I shall never believe this is the case with them, whatever present appearances may be, till I shall have very strong evidence indeed of it. LETTER V. October 13th, 1787. Dear Sir, Thus I have examined the federal constitution as far as a few days leisure would permit. It opens to my mind a new scene; instead of seeing powers cautiously lodged in the hands of numerous legislators, and many magistrates, we see all important powers collecting in one centre, where a few men will possess them almost at discretion. [238]And instead of checks in the formation of the government, to secure the rights of the people against the usurpation of those they appoint to govern, we are to understand the equal division of lands among our people, and the strong arm furnished them by nature and situation, are to secure them against those usurpations. If there are advantages in the equal division of our lands, and the strong and manly habits of our people, we ought to establish governments calculated to give duration to them, and not governments which never can work naturally, till that equality of property, and those free and manly habits shall be destroyed; these evidently are not the natural basis of the proposed constitution.—No man of reflection, and skilled in the science of government, can suppose these will move on harmoniously together for ages, or even for fifty years. As to the little circumstances commented upon, by some writers, with applause—as the age of a representative, of the president, &c.—they have, in my mind, no weight in the general tendency of the system. There are, however, in my opinion, many good things in the proposed system. It is founded on elective principles, and the deposits of powers in several hands, is essentially right.—The guards against those evils we have experienced in some states in legislation are valuable indeed: but the value of every feature in this system is vastly lessened for the want of that one important feature in a free government, a representation of the people. Because we have sometimes abused democracy, I am not among those men who think a democratic branch a nuisance; which branch shall be sufficiently numerous, to admit some of the best informed men of each order in the community into the administration of government. While the radical defects in the proposed system are not so soon discovered, some temptations to each state, and to many classes of men to adopt it, are very visible. It uses the democratic language of several of the state constitutions, particularly that of Massachusetts; the eastern states will receive advantages so far as the regulation of trade, by a bare majority, is committed to it: Connecticut and New-Jersey will receive their share of a general impost:25—The middle states will receive the advantages surrounding the seat of government:—The southern states will receive protection, and have their negroes represented in the legislature, and large back countries will soon have a majority in it.—This system promises a large field of employment to military gentlemen, and gentlemen of the law; and in case the government shall be executed without convulsions, it will afford security to creditors, to the clergy, salary-men and others depending on money payments. So far as the system promises justice and reasonable advantages, in these respects, it [239]ought to be supported by all honest men; but whenever it promises unequal and improper advantages to any particular states, or orders of men, it ought to be opposed. I have, in the course of these letters observed, that there are many good things in the proposed constitution, and I have endeavoured to point out many important defects in it. I have admitted that we want a federal system—that we have a system presented, which, with several alterations, may be made a tolerable good one—I have admitted there is a well founded uneasiness among creditors and mercantile men. In this situation of things, you ask me what I think ought to be done? My opinion in this case is only the opinion of an individual, and so far only as it correspondents26 with the opinions of the honest and substantial part of the community, is it entitled to consideration. Though I am fully satisfied that the state conventions ought most seriously to direct their exertions to altering and amending the system proposed before they shall adopt it—yet I have not sufficiently examined the subject, or formed an opinion, how far it will be practicable for those conventions to carry their amendments. As to the idea, that it will be in vain for those conventions to attempt amendments, it cannot be admitted; it is impossible to say whether they can or not until the attempt shall be made: and when it shall be determined, by experience, that the conventions cannot agree in amendments, it will then be an important question before the people of the United States, whether they will adopt or not the system proposed in its present form. This subject of consolidating the states is new; and because forty or fifty men have agreed in a system, to suppose the good sense of this country, an enlightened nation, must adopt it without examination, and though in a state of profound peace, without endeavouring to amend those parts they perceive are defective, dangerous to freedom, and destructive of the valuable principles of republican government—is truly humiliating. It is true there may be danger in delay; but there is danger in adopting the system in its present form; and I see the danger in either case will arise principally from the conduct and views of two very unprincipled parties in the United States—two fires, between which the honest and substantial people have long found themselves situated. One party is composed of little insurgents, men in debt, who want no law, and who want a share of the property of others; these are called levellers, Shayites, &c. The other party is composed of a few, but more dangerous men, with their servile dependents; these avariciously grasp at27 power and property; you may discover in all the actions of these men, an evident dislike to free and equal governments, and they will go systematically to work to change, essentially, the forms of government in this [240]country; these are called aristocrates, morrisites,28 &c. &c. Between these two parties is the weight of the community; the men of middling property, men not in debt on the one hand, and men, on the other, content with republican governments, and not aiming at immense fortunes, offices, and power. In 1786, the little insurgents, the levellers, came forth, invaded the rights of others, and attempted to establish governments according to their wills.29 Their movements evidently gave encouragement to the other party, which, in 1787, has taken the political field, and with its fashionable dependents, and the tongue and the pen, is endeavouring to establish in great haste, a politer kind of government. These two parties, which will probably be opposed or united as it may suit their interests and views, are really insignificant, compared with the solid, free, and independent part of the community. It is not my intention to suggest, that either of these parties, and the real friends of the proposed constitution, are the same men. The fact is, these aristocrats support and hasten the adoption of the proposed constitution, merely because they think it is a stepping stone to their favourite object. I think I am well founded in this idea; I think the general politics of these men support it, as well as the common observation among them, That the proffered plan is the best that can be got at present, it will do for a few years, and lead to something better. The sensible and judicious part of the community will carefully weigh all these circumstances; they will view the late convention as a respectable assembly of men—America probably never will see an assembly of men of a like number, more respectable. But the members of the convention met without knowing the sentiments of one man in ten thousand in these states respecting the new ground taken. Their doings are but the first attempts in the most important scene ever opened. Though each individual in the state conventions will not, probably, be so respectable as each individual in the federal convention, yet as the state conventions will probably consist of fifteen hundred or two thousand men of abilities,30 and versed in the science of government, collected from all parts of ⟨the community and from all orders of men, it must be acknowledged that the weight of respectability will be in them—In them will be collected the solid sense and the real political character of the country. Being revisers of the subject, they will possess peculiar advantages. To say that these conventions ought not to attempt, coolly and deliberately, the revision of the system, or that they cannot amend it, is very foolish or very assuming. If these conventions, after examining the system, adopt it, I shall be perfectly satisfied, and wish to see men make the administration of the government an equal blessings31 to all orders of men. I believe the great body of our people to be virtuous [241]and friendly to good government, to the protection of liberty and property; and it is the duty of all good men, especially of those who are placed as centinels to guard their rights—it is their duty to examine into the prevailing politics of parties, and to disclose them—while they avoid exciting undue suspicions, to lay facts before the people, which will enable them to form a proper judgment. Men, who wish the people of this country to determine for themselves, and deliberately to fit the government to their situation, must feel some degree of indignation at those attempts to hurry the adoption of a system, and to shut the door against examination. The very attempts create suspicions, that those who make them have secret views, or see some defects in the system, which, in the hurry of affairs, they expect will escape the eye of a free people. What can be the views of those gentlemen in Pennsylvania, who precipitated decisions on this subject?32 What can be the views of those gentlemen in Boston, who countenanced the Printers in shutting up the press against a fair and free investigation of this important system in the usual way.33 The members of the convention have done their duty—why should some of them fly to their states—almost forget a propriety of behaviour, and precipitate measures for the adoption of a system of their own making? I confess candidly, when I consider these circumstances in connection with the unguarded parts of the system I have mentioned, I feel disposed to proceed with very great caution, and to pay more attention than usual to the conduct of particular characters. If the constitution presented be a good one, it will stand the test with a well informed people: all are agreed there shall be state conventions to examine it: and we must believe it will be adopted, unless we suppose it is a bad one, or that those conventions will make false divisions respecting it. I admit improper measures are taken against the adoption of the system as well as for it—all who object to the plan proposed ought to point out the defects⟩34 objected to, and to propose those amendments with which they can accept it, or to propose some other system of government, that the public mind may be known, and that we may be brought to agree in some system of government, to strengthen and execute the present, or to provide a substitute. I consider the field of enquiry just opened, and that we are to look to the state conventions for ultimate decisions on the subject before us; it is not to be presumed, that they will differ about small amendments, and lose a system when they shall have made it substantially good; but touching the essential amendments, it is to be presumed the several conventions will pursue the most rational measures to agree in and obtain them; and such defects as they shall discover [242]and not remove, they will probably notice, keep them in view as the ground work of future amendments, and in the firm and manly language which every free people ought to use, will suggest to those who may hereafter administer the government, that it is their expectation, that the system will be so organized by legislative acts, and the government so administered, as to render those defects as little injurious as possible.—Our countrymen are entitled to an honest and faithful government; to a government of laws and not of men; and also to one of their chusing—as a citizen of the country, I wish to see these objects secured, and licentious, assuming, and overbearing men restrained; if the constitution or social compact be vague and unguarded, then we depend wholly upon the prudence, wisdom and moderation of those who manage the affairs of government; or on what, probably, is equally uncertain and precarious, the success of the people oppressed by the abuse of government, in receiving it from the hands of those who abuse it, and placing it in the hands of those who will use it well. In every point of view, therefore, in which I have been able, as yet, to contemplate this subject, I can discern but one rational mode of proceeding relative to it; and that is to examine it with freedom and candour, to have state conventions some months hence, which shall examine coolly every article, clause, and word in the system proposed, and to adopt it with such amendments as they shall think fit. How far the state conventions ought to pursue the mode prescribed by the federal convention of adopting or rejecting the plan in toto, I leave it to them to determine. Our examination of the subject hitherto has been rather of a general nature. The republican characters in the several states, who wish to make this plan more adequate to security of liberty and property, and to the duration of the principles of a free government, will, no doubt, collect their opinions to certain points, and accurately define those alterations and amendments they wish; if it shall be found they essentially disagree in them, the conventions will then be able to determine whether to adopt the plan as it is, or what will be proper to be done. Under these impressions, and keeping in view the improper and unadvisable lodgment of powers in the general government, organized as it at present is, touching internal taxes, armies and militia, the elections of its own members, causes between citizens of different states, &c. and the want of a more perfect bill of rights, &c.—I drop the subject for the present, and when I shall have leisure to revise and correct my ideas respecting it, and to collect into points the opinions of those who wish to make the system more secure and safe, perhaps I may proceed to point out particularly for your consideration, the amendment35 which [243]ought to be ingrafted into this system, and36 only in conformity to my own, but the deliberate opinions of others—you will with me perceive, that the objections to the plan proposed may, by a more leisure examination be set in a stronger point of view, especially the important one, that there is no substantial representation in the people provided for in a government, in which the most essential powers, even as to the internal police of the country, is proposed to be lodged. ⟨I think the honest and substantial part of the community, will wish to see this system altered, permanency and consistency given to the constitution we shall adopt; and therefore they will be anxious to apportion the powers to the features and organization of the government, and to see abuse in the exercise of power more effectually guarded against. It is suggested, that state officers, from interested motives will oppose the constitution itself37—I see no reason for this, their places in general will not be effected, but new openings to offices and places of profit must evidently be made by the adoption of the constitution in its present form.⟩38"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,11/14/1787,"Extract of a letter from a gentleman in New-York to his friend on the present Assembly, dated October 26, 1787. “I suppose you, my dear friend, at this moment in deep divan with your conferees, at Richmond, deciding on the new constitution. If you and I differ in this, I must give up all politics in future, and content myself with contemplating, with philosophic phlegm, the effects of so speedy a departure from those principles for which we risked our lives and fortunes against Great-Britain. I have not only no objection to, but am extremely desirous of, a strong and general government, provided the fundamental principles of liberty be well secured. These I [157]take to be, trial by jury as has been and is practised—the check of impeachment—the distinct organization and operation of the three great powers of government, the legislative, judicial, and executive. In all these great points the proposed constitution requires amendment, before it can be adopted even with safety. “In the constitution of the federal court, where its jurisdiction is original, the securing jury trial in criminal, is, according to all legal reasoning, an exclusion of it in civil matters—and in its appellant function it is expressly said the court shall judge both of law and fact. This of course renders the finding of a jury below, totally nugatory. “The right of impeachment is speciously secured to the representative of the people. But who are the court to try it? The Senate, who are the advisers in all executive acts of civil government, which are of any importance. This House then are to try the executive officers either for obeying or disobeying their determination, and in both cases must be at once parties and judges. Could any device be more effectual to render this great and salutary prerogative of the people specious in appearance, but nugatory in operation. “To vest judicial, legislative, and executive powers in the same body, is admitted by all constitutional writers as parental of aristocratic tyranny, or single despotism. It is besides an evident absurdity, because the powers are incongruous. These functions are so distinct in their nature, that they require different talents to discharge them—they are so arduous, that they demand the constant attention of the most able to execute them well—they are so incompatible, that even Kings and despots find it necessary to give the execution of them to different bodies. How then can we admit a constitution, which accumulates in one body so great a proportion of the legislative authority, so vast an influence in the executive department, and the transcendent power of judging in all impeachments? “These are great defects—the smaller ones, Quos aut encuria fudit, Aut humana parum cavit naturae.2 I do not trouble you with; nor with the hazard our particular state runs of being made the subject of a ruinous monopoly in the commercial or carrying states. I perceive that in almost all things the eastern states outwit and outhinges us.3 There is at least some danger, that under the proposed constitution their interests would be always paramount to ours. “There is a most strange desire to give foreigners the advantage in legal pursuits over our fellow citizens. Where this Donquixotism in politics finds it equal I do not know. It has I am sure no foundation [158]in practice; for can there be justice in allowing a foreigner, who resides at the federal court, to drag a citizen with whom he has any money transaction, from Georgia to the federal court to answer the foreigners suit? Is there a nation in the world in which an American has such a superiority over the natives? Is it not always held, that the utmost a foreigner can expect, is to be upon a par with the natives? what foreigner will disire to become a citizen, when by so doing he will lose that extraordinary pre-eminence? One would think it was calculated to make our country swarm with foreigners, instead of emigrants—and invite them to prey upon the American natives, who must either yield to every demand of a foreigner, or be utterly ruined in the litigation. “The junction of the New-England States with Pennsylvania will lay Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina under contribution at pleasure under the proposed constitution. They have lately given us a foretaste of this combination in late appointments in that country, which they owe to the bounty of Virginia, and in which, in return they will not suffer one Virginian to have a place of honor, influence, or profit.4 “A Delegate from one of the Eastern states declared that the country was to be peopled by New-Englanders, and they only had a right to all the posts.5 Suppose after they have augmented their marine by exorbitant profits on the monopoly of our freight, they should say as they only could protect the American shores they only should regulate every thing belonging to them. The reasoning might be as bad as what they apply to the western country; but the same combination would form a majority that would give it effect. The pride of Virginia will rise at this supposition, and will say, we shall always be strong enough to assert our own right, have men and materials for ship-building as well as they, and therefore we have no occasion to fear this. Alas, my good friend, pride is a bad reasoner, and the fat indolence of our countrymen, is illy calculated for a persevering combat with the hungry enterprise of the—and the insatiable rapacity of the—. Looking forward then a little to the probable consequences of admitting the intended constitution, we cannot but perceive that we are forging fetters for Virginia, and reducing her to receive laws from—and—by a superior naval power in our front, and a powerful people in our rear, consisting chiefly of New-Englanders and Pennsylvanians, and governed by them entirely.”"
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,11/15/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. In the investigation of the constitution, under your consideration, great care should be taken, that you do not form your opinions respecting it, from unimportant provisions, or fallacious appearances. On a careful examination, you will find, that many of its parts, of little moment, are well formed; in these it has a specious resemblance of a free government—but this is not sufficient to justify the adoption of it—the gilded pill, is often found to contain the most deadly poison. You are not however to expect, a perfect form of government, any more than to meet with perfection in man; your views therefore, ought to be directed to the main pillars upon which a free government is to rest; if these are well placed, on a foundation that will support the superstructure, you should be satisfied, although the building may want a number of ornaments, which, if your particular tastes were gratified, you would have added to it: on the other hand, if the foundation is insecurely laid, and the main supports are wanting, or not properly fixed, however the fabric may be decorated and adorned, you ought to reject it. Under these impressions, it has been my object to turn your attention to the principal defects in this system. I have attempted to shew, that a consolidation of this extensive continent, under one government, for internal, as well as external purposes, which is evidently the tendency of this constitution, cannot succeed, without a sacrifice of your liberties; and therefore that the attempt is not only preposterous, but extremely dangerous; and I have shewn, independent of this, that the plan is radically defective in a fundamental principle, which ought to be found in every free government; to wit, a declaration of rights. I shall now proceed to take a nearer view of this system, to examine its parts more minutely, and shew that the powers are not properly deposited, for the security of public liberty. [253 The first important object that presents itself in the organization of this government, is the legislature. This is to be composed of two branches; the first to be called the general assembly, and is to be chosen by the people of the respective states, in proportion to the number of their inhabitants, and is to consist of sixty five members, with powers in the legislature to encrease the number, not to exceed one for every thirty thousand inhabitants. The second branch is to be called the senate, and is to consist of twenty-six members, two of which are to be chosen by the legislatures of each of the states. In the former of these there is an appearance of justice, in the appointment of its members—but if the clause, which provides for this branch, be stripped of its ambiguity, it will be found that there is really no equality of representation, even in this house. The words are “representatives and direct taxes, shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included in this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons.”—What a strange and unnecessary accumulation of words are here used to conceal from the public eye, what might have been expressed in the following concise manner. Representatives are to be proportioned among the states respectively, according to the number of freemen and slaves inhabiting them, counting five slaves for three free men. “In a free state,” says the celebrated Montesquieu, “every man, who is supposed to be a free agent, ought to be concerned in his own government, therefore the legislature should reside in the whole body of the people, or their representatives.”2 But it has never been alledged that those who are not free agents, can, upon any rational principle, have any thing to do in government, either by themselves or others. If they have no share in government, why is the number of members in the assembly, to be increased on their account? Is it because in some of the states, a considerable part of the property of the inhabitants consists in a number of their fellow men, who are held in bondage, in defiance of every idea of benevolence, justice, and religion, and contrary to all the principles of liberty, which have been publickly avowed in the late glorious revolution? If this be a just ground for representation, the horses in some of the states, and the oxen in others, ought to be represented—for a great share of property in some of them, consists in these animals; and they have as much controul over their own actions, as these poor unhappy creatures, who are intended to be described in the above recited clause, by the words, “all other persons.” [254]By this mode of apportionment, the representatives of the different parts of the union, will be extremely unequal; in some of the southern states, the slaves are nearly equal in number to the free men; and for all these slaves, they will be entitled to a proportionate share in the legislature—this will give them an unreasonable weight in the government, which can derive no additional strength, protection, nor defence from the slaves, but the contrary. Why then should they be represented? What adds to the evil is, that these states are to be permitted to continue the inhuman traffic of importing slaves, until the year 1808—and for every cargo of these unhappy people, which unfeeling, unprincipled, barbarous, and avaricious wretches, may tear from their country, friends and tender connections, and bring into those states, they are to be rewarded by having an increase of members in the general assembly. There appears at the first view a manifest inconsistency, in the apportionment of representatives in the senate, upon the plan of a consolidated government. On every principle of equity, and propriety, representation in a government should be in exact proportion to the numbers, or the aids afforded by the persons represented. How unreasonable, and unjust then is it, that Delaware should have a representation in the senate, equal to Massachusetts, or Virginia? The latter of which contains ten times her numbers, and is to contribute to the aid of the general government in that proportion? This article of the constitution will appear the more objectionable, if it is considered, that the powers vested in this branch of the legislature are very extensive, and greatly surpass those lodged in the assembly, not only for general purposes, but, in many instances, for the internal police of the states. The other branch of the legislature, in which, if in either, a faint spark of democracy is to be found, should have been properly organized and established—but upon examination you will find, that this branch does not possess the qualities of a just representation, and that there is no kind of security, imperfect as it is, for its remaining in the hands of the people. It has been observed, that the happiness of society is the end of government—that every free government is founded in compact; and that, because it is impracticable for the whole community to assemble, or when assembled, to deliberate with wisdom, and decide with dispatch, the mode of legislating by representation was devised. The very term, representative, implies, that the person or body chosen for this purpose, should resemble those who appoint them—a representation of the people of America, if it be a true one, must be like the people. It ought to be so constituted, that a person, who is a stranger to the country, might be able to form a just idea of their character, [255]by knowing that of their representatives. They are the sign—the people are the thing signified. It is absurd to speak of one thing being the representative of another, upon any other principle. The ground and reason of representation, in a free government, implies the same thing. Society instituted government to promote the happiness of the whole, and this is the great end always in view in the delegation of powers. It must then have been intended, that those who are placed instead of the people, should possess their sentiments and feelings, and be governed by their interests, or, in other words, should bear the strongest resemblance of those in whose room they are substituted. It is obvious, that for an assembly to be a true likeness of the people of any country, they must be considerably numerous.—One man, or a few men, cannot possibly represent the feelings, opinions, and characters of a great multitude. In this respect, the new constitution is radically defective.—The house of assembly, which is intended as a representation of the people of America, will not, nor cannot, in the nature of things, be a proper one—sixty-five men cannot be found in the United States, who hold the sentiments, possess the feelings, or are acquainted with the wants and interests of this vast country. This extensive continent is made up of a number of different classes of people; and to have a proper representation of them, each class ought to have an opportunity of choosing their best informed men for the purpose; but this cannot possibly be the case in so small a number. The state of New-York, on the present apportionment, will send six members to the assembly: I will venture to affirm, that number cannot be found in the state, who will bear a just resemblance to the several classes of people who compose it. In this assembly, the farmer, merchant, mec[h]anick, and other various orders of people, ought to be represented according to their respective weight and numbers; and the representatives ought to be intimately acquainted with the wants, understand the interests of the several orders in the society, and feel a proper sense and becoming zeal to promote their prosperity. I cannot conceive that any six men in this state can be found properly qualified in these respects to discharge such important duties: but supposing it possible to find them, is there the least degree of probability that the choice of the people will fall upon such men? According to the common course of human affairs, the natural aristocracy of the country will be elected. Wealth always creates influence, and this is generally much increased by large family connections: this class in society will for ever have a great number of dependents; besides, they will always favour each other—it is their interest to combine—they will therefore constantly unite their efforts to procure men of their own rank to be elected—they will concenter all their force [256]in every part of the state into one point, and by acting together, will most generally carry their election. It is probable, that but few of the merchants, and those the most opulent and ambitious, will have a representation from their body—few of them are characters sufficiently conspicuous to attract the notice of the electors of the state in so limited a representation. The great body of the yeomen of the country cannot expect any of their order in this assembly—the station will be too elevated for them to aspire to—the distance between the people and their representatives, will be so very great, that there is no probability that a farmer, however respectable, will be chosen—the mechanicks of every branch, must expect to be excluded from a seat in this Body—It will and must be esteemed a station too high and exalted to be filled by any but the first men in the state, in point of fortune; so that in reality there will be no part of the people represented, but the rich, even in that branch of the legislature, which is called the democratic.—The well born, and highest orders in life, as they term themselves, will be ignorant of the sentiments of the middling class of citizens, strangers to their ability, wants, and difficulties, and void of sympathy, and fellow feeling. This branch of the legislature will not only be an imperfect representation, but there will be no security in so small a body, against bribery, and corruption—It will consist at first, of sixty-five, and can never exceed one for every thirty thousand inhabitants; a majority of these, that is, thirty-three, are a quorum, and a majority of which, or seventeen, may pass any law—a majority of the senate, or fourteen, are a quorum, and eight of them pass any law—so that twenty-five men, will have the power to give away all the property of the citizens of these states—what security therefore can there be for the people, where their liberties and property are at the disposal of so few men? It will literally be a government in the hands of the few to oppress and plunder the many. You may conclude with a great degree of certainty, that it, like all others of a similar nature, will be managed by influence and corruption, and that the period is not far distant, when this will be the case, if it should be adopted; for even now there are some among us, whose characters stand high in the public estimation, and who have had a principal agency in framing this constitution, who do not scruple to say, that this is the only practicable mode of governing a people, who think with that degree of freedom which the Americans do—this government will have in their gift a vast number of offices of great honor and emolument. The members of the legislature are not excluded from appointments; and twenty-five of them, as the case may be, being secured, any measure may be carried. The rulers of this country must be composed of very different materials from those of any other, of which history gives us any account, if the majority of the legislature are not, before many years, entirely at the devotion of the executive—and these states will soon be under the absolute domination of one, or a few, with the fallacious appearance of being governed by men of their own election. The more I reflect on this subject, the more firmly am I persuaded, that the representation is merely nominal—a mere burlesque; and that no security is provided against corruption and undue influence. No free people on earth, who have elected persons to legislate for them, ever reposed that confidence in so small a number. The British house of commons consists of five hundred and fifty-eight members; the number of inhabitants in Great-Britain, is computed at eight millions—this gives one member for a little more than fourteen thousand, which exceeds double the proportion this country can ever have: and yet we require a larger representation in proportion to our numbers, than Great-Britain, because this country is much more extensive, and differs more in its productions, interests, manners, and habits. The democratic branch of the legislatures of the several states in the union consists, I believe at present, of near two thousand; and this number was not thought too large for the security of liberty by the framers of our state constitutions: some of the states may have erred in this respect, but the difference between two thousand, and sixty-five, is so very great, that it will bear no comparison. Other objections offer themselves against this part of the constitution—I shall reserve them for a future paper,3 when I shall shew, defective as this representation is, no security is provided, that even this shadow of the right, will remain with the people."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,,11/15/1787,"SIR, Your speech has varnished an iron trap, ba[i]ted with some illustrious names, to catch the liberties of the people. And this you are pleased to call a constitution—“the best form of government that was ever offered to the world.” May Heaven then have mercy on the world [258]and on us. And in this prayer, I am persuaded, you will join me when you come to consider temperately, the unbounded powers given to this best of all possible governments; and then recollect, from your reading, what horrible abuses have grown from too unlimited a confidence of the people in their rulers. It is always both easier and safer, to add to powers, which are found to be insufficient, than to recall those which are injuriously large. This is a maxim, which no people, who mean to be free, should ever forget. While the people have something to give, they will be respected by their rulers. When with Cappadocian baseness,2 they resign all at once, they will be deemed fit only to be hewers of wood and drawers of water.3 In my former papers, I have shewn, that the freedom of the press is left at the mercy of the proposed government—that the sacred trial by jury, in civil cases, is at best doubtful; and in all cases of appeal expressly taken away. In equal insecurity, or rather equally at mercy, are we left as to—liberty of conscience. We find nothing that regards it, except the following;—“but no religious test shall every be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.” This exception implies, and necessarily implies, that in all other cases whatever liberty of conscience may be regulated. For, though no such power is expressly given, yet it is plainly meant to be included in the general powers, or else this exception would have been totally unnecessary—For why should it be said, that no religious test should be required as a qualification for office, if no power was given or intended to be given to impose a religious test of any kind? Upon the omission of the trial by jury in civil cases, you observe—“when this subject was in discussion, we were involved in difficulties which pressed on all sides, and no precedent could be discovered to direct our course. The cases open to trial by jury differed in the different states, it was therefore impracticable on that ground to have made a general rule.”—So, because the extent of the trial by jury varied in the different states, therefore it was proper to abolish it in all. For what else can your words—“it was impracticable to have made a general rule” mean?—If ever the rule is made, it must be general. And if this is impracticable—it surely follows, that in the fœderal court we must go without it in civil cases. What sense is there in supposing, that what, for the reasons you alledge, was impracticable with the Convention, will be practicable with the Congress? What faculty can the one body have more than the other, of reconciling contradictions? But the sophistry of this excuse consists in the word made—make you might not, but surely nothing hindered your proposing the general rule, which, if approved by the several state Conventions, would make the rule. You have made nothing. You have only [259]proposed. It rests with the several conventions, to make your propositions, rules. It is not possible to say, that the Convention could not have proposed, that there should be one similar general mode of trial by jury in the Fœderal court in all cases whatever. If the states would not have acceded to the proposition, we should only be where we are. And that this trial by jury is best, even in courts where the civil law process now prevails, I think no unbigoted man can doubt. Judge Blackstone is so explicit on this head, that I need only quote him to enforce conviction on every unprejudiced mind.—“This open examination of witnesses viva voce, in the presence of all mankind, is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth, than the private and secret examination taken down in writing before an officer, or his clerk, in the ecclesiastical courts, and all others that have borrowed their practice from the civil law; where a witness may frequently depose that in private which he will be ashamed to testify in a public and solemn tribunal. Where an artful or careless scribe may make a witness speak what he never meant, by dressing up his depositions in his own forms and language; but he is here at liberty to correct and explain his meaning, if misunderstood, which he can never do after a written deposition is once taken. Besides the occasional questions of the judge, the jury, and the counsel, propounded to the witnesses on a sudden, will sift out the truth much better than a formal set of interrogatories previously penned and settled; and the confronting of adverse witnesses is also another opportunity of obtaining a clear discovery, which can never be had on any other method of trial. Nor is the presence of the judge, during the examination, a matter of small importance; for besides the respect, &c. with which his presence will naturally inspire the witness, he is able by use and experience to keep the evidence from wandering from the point in issue. In short, by this method of examination, and this only, the persons who are to decide upon the evidence, have an opportunity of observing the quality, age, education, understanding, behaviour, and inclinations of the witness; in which points all persons must appear alike, when their depositions are reduced to writing and read to the judge, in the absence of those who made them; and yet as much may be frequently collected from the manner in which the evidence is delivered as from the matter of it. These are a few of the advantages attending this way of giving testimony oretenus; which was also, indeed, familiar among the ancient Romans.”4 They who applaud the practice of civil law courts, must either have seen very little of such practice not to know that it is liable to infinite fraud, corruption, and oppression. As far as it prevails in the English system of jurisprudence, from which we derive ours, it is a remnant of [260]ecclesiastical tyranny. The free and pure part of the system, that is the common law courts, have ever cautiously guarded against its encroachments, and restrained its operation. All great judges have reprobated it, except Lord Mansfield. He indeed, has been as desirous of extending it in England, as he was of extending parliamentary power into America; and with the same view—to establish tyranny. This noble Lord’s principles, if we may judge from the proposed constitution, has too many admirers in America. But I shall be told, that almost all the nations in Europe have adopted the civil law. This is true; and it is equally true, that almost all European nations have adopted arbitrary power with the civil law. This ought to be a warning to us how we admit it, even as England has done. It would never have been admitted there, but from the ecclesiastical influence in the days of superstition. This, thank Heaven, is now no more; and I sincerely wish its offspring was also extinct. I have been thus particular on the subject of civil law, to shew how little propriety there was in leaving it upon as respectable a foot, as the common law, in civil cases. In fact, the constitution leaves them both to shift for themselves, in original process, and in appeal seems to favor the former by placing both law and fact, in the arbitrament of the judges. Upon standing armies, sir, your professional dexterity has not abandoned you. The Constitution proposes to give the power of raising and supporting armies—and this without any limitation as to number; and to appropriate money to that object for two years at a time. This you justify by saying, that you “do not know a nation in the world which has not found it necessary and useful to maintain the appearance of strength, in a season of profound tranquility:” your knowledge then, sir, has not extended to free nations. Your phraseology, it is true, is somewhat equivocal; but unless by the term, appearance of strength, we understand, a standing army, we must suppose you to have meant a disingenuous evasion. Your reading might have informed you, sir,—that the Grecian republics, while free, never kept up any standing army—that the Roman republic, while free, never kept up a standing army, but that with them, a standing army and tyranny were co-eval, and concomitant—that in the free Swiss Cantons, no standing army, was ever, or is now permitted; no, sir, in all these great and glorious republics, though surrounded with enemies, their military array was occasional, or at the utmost, annual; nor was there formerly, nor is there now, in the Swiss Cantons, any more appearance of strength kept up in time of peace, than their militia gives: and yet they are free and formidable. You say a standing army has always been, “a topic of popular declamation.” Is it indeed nothing more, sir? Is that which all free nations have studiously avoided, as the rock on which their liberties would suffer shipwreck; that which in fact, is the source and security of tyranny; that which all great political writers concur in condemning; that which has animated the ardor, and inflamed the eloquence of the first orators in the two houses of parliament, in Great-Britain—that which all the art and influence of the crown could never obtain from the people for more than a year5—is all that, sir, nothing more but a topic of popular declamation? Is it surprising, that such knowledge, and such sentiments, as this declaration holds out, should have given us such a constitution? But the weightiest reason is, that without a standing army, “the government must declare war, before they are prepared to carry it on.” This is without question a most warlike paragraph: whether we are to invade Great-Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, or all together, under the new constitution, and with the standing army it has given, you have not been pleased to inform us. To do this, a navy too will be necessary, and I see no provision for that: however, I suppose that, as well as every thing else, is included in the power “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing, and all other powers vested by this constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.” Let then the people rightly understand, that one blessing of the constitution will be, the taxing them to support fleets and armies to conquer other nations, against whom the ambition of their new rulers may declare war."
Newspaper,No,An Observer,,New York Journal,Publius,11/19/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, A writer, under the signature of Publius, or the Federalist, No. V. in the Daily Advertiser, and in the New-York Packet, with a view of proving the advantages which, he says, will be derived by the states if the new Constitution is adopted—has given extracts of a letter from Queen Anne to the Scotch parliament, on the subject of a union, between Scotland and England, and which I shall also here insert. “An entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace: It will secure your religion, liberty and property, remove the animosities among yourselves, and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms. It must increase your strength, riches and trade; and by this union the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of different interest, will be ⟨enable[d] to resist all its enemies⟩.” “We most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the union may be brought to a happy conclusion, being the only ⟨effectual⟩ way to secure our present and future happiness; and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies, who will doubtless, on this occasion, ⟨use their utmost endeavours to prevent or delay this union⟩.”2 I would beg leave to remark, that Publius has been very unfortunate in selecting these extracts as a case in point, to convince the people of America of the benefits they would derive from a union under such a government, as would be effected by the new system—It is a certainty, that when the union was the subject of debate in the Scottish legislature, some of their most sensible and disinterested nobles, as well as commoners (who were not corrupted by English gold) violently opposed the union, and predicted, that the people of Scotland, would, in fact, derive no advantages from a consolidation of government with England, but, on the contrary, bear a great proportion of her debt, and furnish large bodies of men to assist in her wars with France, with whom, before the union, Scotland was at all times on terms of the most cordial amity. It was also predicted, that the representation in the parliament of Great-Britain, particularly in the house of commons, was too [269]small;—forty-five members being very far from the proportion of Scotland, when its extent and numbers were duly considered; and that even they, being so few, might (or at least a majority of them might) at all times be immediately under the influence of the English ministry; and, of course, very little of their attention would be given to the true interests of their constituents, especially if they came in competition with the projects or views of the ministry. How far these predictions have been verified, I believe it will not require much trouble to prove; as it must be obvious to every one, the least acquainted with the English history, since the union of the two nations, that the great body of the people in Scotland, are in a much worse situation now, than they would be, were they a separate nation. This will be fully illustrated, by attending to the great emigrations which are made to America; for if the people could have but a common support at home, it is unreasonable to suppose, that such large numbers would quit their country, break from the tender ties of kindred and friendship, and trust themselves on a dangerous voyage across a vast ocean, to a country of which they can know but little, except by common report. I will only further remark, that it is not above two or three years since a member of the British parliament (I believe Mr. Dempster) gave a most pathetic description of the sufferings of the commonality of Scotland, particularly on the sea coast, and endeavoured to call the attention of parliament to their distresses, and afford them some relief, by encouraging their fisheries.3 It deserves also to be remembered, that the people of Scotland, in the late war, between France and Great-Britain, petitioned to have arms and ammunition supplied them by their general government, for their defence, alledging that they were incapable of defending themselves, and their property, from an invasion, unless they were assisted by government. It is a truth that their petitions were disregarded, and reasons were assigned, that it would be dangerous to intrust them with the means of defence, as they would then have it in their power to break the union. From this representation of the situation of Scotland, surely no one can draw any conclusion, that this country would derive happiness or security from a government which would, in reality, give the people but the mere name of being free; for if the representation, stipulated by the constitution, framed by the late Convention, be attentively and dispassionately considered, it must be obvious to every disinterested observer (besides many other weighty objections which will present themselves to his view) that the number is not, by any means, adequate to the present inhabitants of this extensive continent, much less to those it will contain at a future period. I observe that the writer above-mentioned, takes great pains to shew the disadvantages which would result from three or four distinct confederacies of these states.4 I must confess that I have not seen, in any of the pieces published against the proposed constitution, any thing which gives the most distant idea that their writers are in favor of such governments; but it is clear these objections arise from a consolidation not affording security for the liberties of their country; and from hence it must evidently appear, that the design of Publius, in artfully holding up to public view such confederacies, can be with no other intention than wilfully to deceive his fellow citizens. I am confident it must be, and that it is, the sincere wish of every true friend to the United States, that there should be a confederated national government, but that it should be one which would have a controul over national and external matters only, and not interfere with the internal regulations and police of the different states in the union. Such a government, while it would give us respectability abroad, would not encroach upon, or subvert our liberties at home. November 13, 1787."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,11/21/1787,"Dear Sir, As you have several Times intimated a Wish to know my Sentiments, relative to the conduct of the late Convention, as well as of the Constitution, which they have offered to the Consideration of the People, I shall freely, as often as convenient, communicate whatever occurs to me on the Subject, as most worthy of Observation, if not already publicly discussed. When the Latter is the Case, perhaps I may drop a Sentiment concerning the Propriety, or Impropriety, of the Discussion, &c. But all this, my Friend, will, in a great Measure, depend on your reciprocating; for I am too phlegmatic to write, unless answered. In the first Place then, most unfeignedly do I wish, and that for the Sake of Humanity, that the Convention never had existed; and, for the Sake of our old illustrious Commander in chief,2 I wish, as they have [273]departed from their Institution, that they had offered a Constitution more worthy of so great a Character. But, as he has acted entirely in a Ministerial Capacity, so I wish to consider him, whenever I am obliged to mention his venerable Name, or allude to it. Not that I think any Name, however great, can justify Injustice, or make Slavery more eligible than Freedom, and beg to be so understood. Yet, ⟨when I consider the original Confederation, and Constitutions of the States which compose the Union, as well as the Resolutions of several of the States, for calling a Convention to amend the Confederation, which it admits, but not a new one, I am greatly at a Loss to account for the surprizing Conduct of so many wise Men, as must have composed that honorable Body. In fact, I do not know, at present, whether it can be accounted for; unless it be by supposing a Predetermination of a Majority of the Members to reject their Instructions, and all authority under which they acted. If this be the Case, the Transition to prostrating every Thing that stood in their Way, though ever so serviceable or sacred to others, was natural and easy.—However, I do not even wish to think so unfavorably of the Majority; but rather, that several of them, were, by different Means, insidiously drawn into the Measures of the more artful and designing Members, who have long envied the great Body of the People, in the United States, the Liberties which they enjoy.—And, as a Proof of their being Enemies to the Rights of Mankind, permit me to refer you to the first Clause, of the 9th Section, of the first Article of the new Constitution, which is framed to deprive Millions of the human Species of their natural Rights, and, perhaps, as many more of their Lives in procuring others! That Clause, you will immediately perceive, has been purposely so contrived for reviving that wicked and inhuman Trade to Africa.—That Trade in Blood, and every Vice, of which the Avarice, Pride, Insolence and Cruelty, of Man is capable! A Trade, which, if ever permitted, will entail eternal Infamy on the United States, and all that they have ever said or done in Defence of Freedom.⟩—Will it not be said, that the greatest Sticklers for Liberty, are its worst Enemies?—For these Gentlemen, no doubt, mean to treat the United States, if they adopt the new Constitution, as they have some of their Colleagues; that is, make Cloaks of them, to cover their Wickedness. At the Moment it is adopted by the States, in its present Form, that Moment the external Turpitude of it is transferred to the Adoptors; and the Framers of it will immediately say, it was called for by the People, of whom they were but the Servants, and, that the Adoption is a Proof of the Assertion. [274] Perhaps you may next enquire what can be done?—If you should, I will tell you, on Condition that you pardon the Anticipation, the Legislature may, and with the greatest Propriety, as its Delegate3 has exceeded his Powers, or rejected them, consider all that he has done as a Nullity.—Would not this be a useful Lesson for Usurpers? Indeed, I cannot see the Consistency or Propriety of Congress’s sending it, or even permitting it to be sent, to the Legislatures that compose the present Union, when it entirely annihilates the Confederation under which they act, and which admits not of any thing more than an Emendation, as is evident by the 13th article. But, as I have often told you, such is the unfortunate Lot of Humanity, that there are a Thousand brilliant Characters, to one that is always consistent, and, of this, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. John Dickinson, are two recent Examples among the Many. The Doctor is at the Head of a humane Institution for promoting the Emancipation of Slaves, or abolishing Slavery;4 yet lends his Assistance to frame a Constitution which evidently has a Tendency not only to enslave all those whom it ought to protect; but avowedly encourages the enslaving of those over whom it can have no Manner of Right, to exercise the least shadow of Authority. Mr. Dickinson, a few Years before the Revolution, publicly impeached the Doctor’s Conduct for offering to attempt a Change in the chartered Privileges of Pennsylvania,5 and now joins him in destroying a far superior Constitution, yes, thirteen far superior Constitutions, and opening a Trade which is a Disgrace to Humanity! Will not such Conduct leave these Gentlemen Monuments of much departed Fame? As I have several of their Publications by me, which, I imagine you never saw, I purpose in my Next, to let them speak for themselves, if you have no Objection. I am, Dear Sir, very respectfully, yours, A COUNTRYMAN. November 10, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Cato,,New York Journal,,11/22/1787,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. In my last number1 I endeavored to prove that the language of the article relative to the establishment of the executive of this new government [277]was vague and inexplicit, that the great powers of the President, connected with his duration in office would lead to oppression and ruin. That he would be governed by favorites and flatterers, or that a dangerous council would be collected from the great officers of state;—that the ten miles square, if the remarks of one of the wisest men,2 drawn from the experience of mankind, may be credited, would be the asylum of the base, idle, avaricious and ambitious, and that the court would possess a language and manners different from yours; that a vice-president is as unnecessary, as he is dangerous in his influence—that the president cannot represent you, because he is not of your own immediate choice, that if you adopt this government, you will incline to an arbitrary and odious aristocracy or monarchy—that the president possessed of the power, given him by this frame of government differs but very immaterially from the establishment of monarchy in Great-Britain, and I warned you to beware of the fallacious resemblance that is held out to you by the advocates of this new system between it and your own state governments. And here I cannot help remarking, that inexplicitness seems to pervade this whole political fabric: certainly in political compacts, which Mr. Coke calls the mother and nurse of repose and quietness,3 the want of which induced men to engage in political society, has ever been held by a wise and free people as essential to their security, as on the one hand it fixes barriers which the ambitious and tyrannically disposed magistrate dare not overleap, and on the other, becomes a wall of safety to the community—otherwise stipulations between the governors and governed are nugatory; and you might as well deposit the important powers of legislation and execution in one or a few and permit them to govern according to their disposition and will; but the world is too full of examples, which prove that to live by one man’s will became the cause of all men’s misery.4 Before the existence of express political compacts it was reasonably implied that the magistrate should govern with wisdom and justice, but mere implication was too feeble to restrain the unbridled ambition of a bad man, or afford security against negligence, cruelly, or any other defect of mind. It is alledged that the opinions and manners of the people of America, are capable to resist and prevent an extension of prerogative or oppression; but you must recollect that opinion and manners are mutable, and may not always be a permanent obstruction against the encroachments of government; that the progress of a commercial society begets luxury, the parent of inequality, the foe to virtue, and the enemy to restraint; and that ambition and voluptuousness aided by flattery, will teach magistrates, where limits are not explicitly fixed to have separate and distinct interests from the people, [278]besides it will not be denied that government assimilates the manners and opinions of the community to it. Therefore, a general presumption that rulers will govern well is not a sufficient security.—You are then under a sacred obligation to provide for the safety of your posterity, and would you now basely desert their interests, when by a small share of prudence you may transmit to them a beautiful political patrimony, which will prevent the necessity of their travelling through seas of blood to obtain that, which your wisdom might have secured:—It is a duty you owe likewise to your own reputation, for you have a great name to lose; you are characterised as cautious, prudent and jealous in politics; whence is it therefore, that you are about to precipitate yourselves into a sea of uncertainty, and adopt a system so vague, and which has discarded so many of your valuable rights:—Is it because you do not believe that an American can be a tyrant? If this be the case you rest on a weak basis, Americans are like other men in similar situations, when the manners and opinions of the community are changed by the causes I mentioned before, and your political compact inexplicit, your posterity will find that great power connected with ambition, luxury, and flattery, will as readily produce a Caesar, Caligula, Nero, and Domitian in America, as the same causes did in the Roman empire. But the next thing to be considered in conformity to my plan, is the first article of this new government, which comprises the erection of the house of representatives and senate, and prescribes their various powers and objects of legislation. The most general objections to the first article, are that bi-ennial elections for representatives are a departure from the safe democratical principles of annual ones—that the number of representatives are too few; that the apportionment and principles of increase are unjust; that no attention has been paid to either the numbers or property in each state in forming the senate; that the mode in which they are appointed and their duration, will lead to the establishment of an aristocracy; that the senate and president are improperly connected, both as to appointments, and the making of treaties, which are to become the supreme law of the land; that the judicial in some measure, to wit, as to the trial of impeachments is placed in the senate a branch of the legislative, and some times a branch of the executive: that Congress have the improper power of making or altering the regulations prescribed by the different legislatures, respecting the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives; and the time and manner of choosing senators; that standing armies may be established, and appropriation of money made [279]for their support, for two years; that the militia of the most remote state may be marched into those states situated at the opposite extreme of this continent; that the slave trade, is to all intents and purposes permanently established; and a slavish capitation, or poll-tax, may at any time be levied—these are some of the many evils that will attend the adoption of this government. But with respect to the first objection, it may be remarked that a well digested democracy has this advantage over all others, to wit, that it affords to many the opportunity to be advanced to the supreme command, and the honors they thereby enjoy fills them with a desire of rendering themselves worthy of them; hence this desire becomes part of their education, is matured in manhood, and produces an ardent affection for their country, and it is the opinion of the great Sidney, and Montesquieu that this in a great measure produced by annual election of magistrates.5 If annual elections were to exist in this government, and learning and information to become more prevalent, you never will want men to execute whatever you could design—Sidney observes that a well governed state is as fruitful to all good purposes as the seven headed serpent is said to have been in evil; when one head is cut off, many rise up in the place of it. He remarks further, that it was also thought, that free cities by frequent elections of magistrates became nurseries of great and able men, every man endeavoring to excel others, that he might be advanced to the honor he had no other title to, than what might arise from his merit, or reputation,6 but the framers of this perfect government, as it is called, have departed from this democratical principle, and established bi-ennial elections, for the house of representatives, who are to be chosen by the people, and sextennial for the senate, who are to be chosen by the legislatures of the different states, and have given to the executive the unprecedented power of making temporary senators, in case of vacancies, by resignation or otherwise,7 and so far forth establishing a precedent for virtual representation (though in fact, their original appointment is virtual) thereby influencing the choice of the legislatures, or if they should not be so complaisant as to conform to his appointment—offence will be given to the executive and the temporary members, will appear ridiculous by rejection; this temporary member, during his time of appointment, will of course act by a power derived from the executive, and for, and under his immediate influence. It is a very important objection to this government, that the representation consists of so few; too few to resist the influence of corruption, and the temptation to treachery, against which all governments [280]ought to take precautions—how guarded you have been on this head, in your own state constitution, and yet the number of senators and representatives proposed for this vast continent, does not equal those of your own state;8 how great the disparity, if you compare them with the aggregate numbers in the United States. The history of representation in England, from which we have taken our model of legislation, is briefly this, before the institution of legislating by deputies, the whole free part of the community usually met for that purpose; when this became impossible, by the increase of numbers, the community was divided into districts, from each of which was sent such a number of deputies as was a complete representation of the various numbers and orders of citizens within them; but can it be asserted with truth, that six men can be a complete and full representation of the numbers and various orders of the people in this state?9 Another thing may be suggested against the small number of representatives is, that but few of you will have the chance of sharing even in this branch of the legislature; and that the choice will be confined to a very few; the more complete it is, the better will your interests be preserved, and the greater the opportunity you will have to participate in government, one of the principal securities of a free people; but this subject has been so ably and fully treated by a writer under the signature of Brutus,10 that I shall content myself with referring you to him thereon, reserving further observations on the other objections I have mentioned, for my future numbers."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/22/1787,"SIR, The public appear to me, sir, to be much indebted to you, for informing them; for what purpose a power was given by the proposed Constitution, of raising and supporting armies.—Some, indeed, might have suspected, that such a power, uncontrouled by any declaration, that the military should always be subject to the civil power, might be intended for the purposes of ambition. Your declaration has removed all doubt. Every principle of policy, you say, would be subverted unless we kept up armies—for what—for our defence?—no,—to support declarations of war—to strike home, with dispatch and secrecy, before the [282]enemy can be apprized of your intention. Upon the same principle a small army would be ridiculous. Nothing less than the Prussian number, about 200,000 men would embrace this salutary object. And as you now say—“no man that regards the dignity and safety of his country can deny the necessity of a military force.”—You will next affirm, that no one, for the same reason, can deny the necessity of a large army. The safety of the country, we have already experienced to depend, upon the militia. Switzerland has often experienced the same. Why then, sir, should you be so very positive, that for this purpose a military force is necessary?—But for the dignity of the country, that is for the ambition of its rulers, armies I confess are necessary; and not less in number than other ambitious rulers maintain, by grinding the face of the people. For every thousand in these armies a million of dollars must be levied upon the public, and such armies—raised and supported, would at once maintain the dignity of government, and ensure the submission of the people. We shall be as dignified as the Turks, and equally free.—The sole power of voting men, and money, is retained by the representative of the people in England. This is their shield and their defence against arbitrary power. Never has the King been able to obtain the extension of this vote beyond a year. But we are called upon, with all the solemnity of a constitutional act, to give it up for two years. And yet, sir, you talk of the controul and the restrictions which the new Constitution provides. There is, I confess, some dexterity in the negative terms in which this power is conceived—not more than two years. But what the Constitution permits, and what it grants are essentially the same. And since it seemed necessary to this almost all confiding Convention, to limit our confidence in this particular, the only rule that observation suggests is, that of England; where this confidence has never exceeded one year. I come now, sir, to the most exceptionable part of the Constitution—the senate. In this, as in every other part, you are in the line of your profession, and on that ground assure your fellow citizens, that—“perhaps there never was a charge made with less reason, than that which predicts the institution of a baneful aristocracy in the Federal Senate.” And yet your conscience smote you, sir, at the beginning, and compelled you to prefix a—perhaps to this strange assertion. The senate, you say, branches into two characters—the one legislative and the other executive. This phraseology is quaint, and the position does not state the whole truth. I am very sorry, sir, to be so often obliged to reprehend the suppression of information at the moment that you stood forth to instruct your fellow citizens, in what they were supposed not to understand. In this character, you should have abandoned your professional [283]line, and told them, not only the truth, but the whole truth. The whole truth then is, that the same body, called the senate, is vested with—legislative—executive—and judicial powers. The two first you acknowlege; the last is conveyed in these words, sec. 3d. The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. On this point then we are to come to issue—whether a senate so constituted is likely to produce a baneful aristocracy, which will swallow up the democratic rights and liberties of the nation. To judge on this question, it is proper to examine minutely into the constitution and powers of the senate; and we shall then see with what anxious and subtle cunning it is calculated for the proposed purpose. 1st. It is removed from the people, being chosen by the legislatures—and exactly in the ratio of their removal from the people, do aristocratic principles constantly infect the minds of man. 2d. They endure, two thirds for four, and one third for six years, and in proportion to the duration of power, the aristocratic exercise of it, and attempts to extend it, are invariably observed to increase. 3d. From the union of the executive with the legislative functions, they must necessarily be longer together, or rather constantly assembled; and in proportion to their continuance together, will they be able to form effectual schemes for extending their own power, and reducing that of the democratic branch. If any one would wish to see this more fully illustrated, let him turn to the history of the Decemviri in Rome.1 4th. Their advice and consent being necessary to the appointment of all the great officers of state, both at home and abroad, will enable them to win over any opponents to their measures in the house of representatives, and give them the influence which, we see, accompanies this power in England; and which, from the nature of man, must follow it every where. 5th. The sole power of impeachment being vested in them, they have it in their power to controul the representative in this high democratic right; to screen from punishment, or rather from conviction, all high offenders, being their creatures, and to keep in awe all opponents to their power in high office. 6th. The union established between them and the vice president, who is made one of the corps, and will therefore be highly animated with the aristocratic spirit of it, furnishes them a powerful shield against popular suspicion and enquiry, he being the second man in the United States who stands highest in the confidence and estimation of the people. And lastly, the right of altering or amending money-bills, is a high additional power given them as a branch of the legislature, which their analogous branch, in the English parliament, could never obtain, because it has been guarded by the representatives of the people there, with the most strenuous solicitude as one of the vital principles of democratic liberty. Is a body so vested with means to soften & seduce—so armed with power to screen or to condemn—so fortified against suspicion and enquiry—so largely trusted with legislative powers—so independent of and removed from the people—so tempted to abuse and extend these powers—is this a body which freemen ought ever to create, or which freemen can ever endure? Or is it not a monster in the political creation, which we ought to regard with horror? Shall we thus forge our own fetters? Shall we set up the idol, before which we shall soon be obliged, however, reluctantly to bow? Shall we consent to see a proud aristocracy erect his domineering crest in triumph over our prostrate liberties? But we shall yet see more clearly, how highly favored this senate has been, by taking a similar view of the representative body. This body is the true representative of the democratic part of the system; the shield and defence of the people. This body should have weight from its members, and the high controul which it should alone possess. We can form no idea of the necessary number in this untried system, to give due weight to the democratic part, but from the example of England. Had it not been intended to humble this branch, it would have been fixed, at least, at their standard. We are to have one representative for every thirty thousand—they have nearly one for ten thousand souls. Their number is about six millions; their representatives five hundred and fifteen. When we are six millions, we shall have only two hundred representatives. In point of number therefore and the weight derived from it, the representative proposed by the constitution is remarkably feeble. It is farther weakened by the senate being allowed not only to reject, but to alter and amend money-bills. Its transcendent and incommunicable power of impeachment—that high source of its dignity and controul—in which alone the majesty of the people feels his sceptre, and bears aloft his fasces—is rendered ineffectual, by its being triable before its rival branch, the senate, the patron and prompter of the measures against which it is to sit in judgment. It is therefore most manifest, that from the very nature of the constitution the right of impeachment apparently given, is really rendered ineffectual. And this is contrived with so much art, that to discover it you must bring together various and distant parts of the constitution, or it will not strike the examiner, that the same body that advises the executive measures of government which are usually the subject of impeachment, are the sole judges on such impeachments. They must therefore be both party and judge, and must condemn those who have executed what they advised. Could such a monstrous absurdity have escaped men who were not determined, at all events, to vest all power in this aristocratic body? Is it not plain, that [285]the senate is to be exalted by the humiliation of the democracy. A democracy which, thus bereft of its powers, and shorn of its strength; will stand a melancholy monument of popular impotence. Hitherto I have examined your senate by its intrinsic and its comparative powers. Let us next examine, how far the principles of its constitution are compatible with what our own constitutions lay down, and what the best writers on the subject have determined to be essential to free and good government. In every state constitution, with a very trifling exception in that of Massachusetts, the legislative and executive powers are vested in different and independent bodies.—Will any one believe, that it is because we are become wiser, that in twelve years we are to overthrow every system which reason and experience taught us was right. Or is it, that a few men, forming a plan at Philadelphia subversive of all former principles, then posting to Congress, and passing it there, and next dispersing themselves in the several states to propagate their errors, and, if they can, get chosen into the state conventions; are actuated by motives of interest and bad ambition? I should be very unwilling to believe the latter, and yet it is utterly incomprehensible, how such a systematic violation of all that has been deemed wise and right, from which no other result can be expected, but the establishment of a baneful aristocracy, could have been recommended to a free and enlightened people. “Lorsque dans la meme personne, says Montesquieu, ou dans le meme corps de magistrature, la puissance legislative est re-unie a la puissance executive; il n’y a point de liberte; parce qu’on peut craindre que le meme monarque, ou le meme Senat ne fasse des loix tyranniques, pour les executer tyranniquement.” “When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same corps, there can be no liberty. Because, it may be feared, that the same monarch or senate will make tyrannical laws, that, they may execute them tyrannically.”2 I am aware that this great man is speaking of a senate being the whole legislative; whereas the one before us is but a branch of the proposed legislature. But still the reason applies, inasmuch as the legislative power of the senate will enable it to negative all bills that are meant to controul the executive, and from being secure of preventing any abridgment, they can watch every pliant hour of the representative body to promote an enlargement of the executive powers. One thing at least is certain, that by making this branch of the legislature participant in the executive, you not only prevent the legislature from being a check upon the executive, but you inevitably prevent its being checked or controuled by the other branch. To the authority of Montesquieu, I shall add that of Mr. de Lolme; whose disquisition on government, is allowed to be deep, solid, and ingenious. [“]Il ne suffisoit pas, says he, d’oter aux legislateurs l’execution des loix, par consequent, l’exemption qui en est la suite immediate; il falloit encore, leur oter ce qui eut produit les memes effects—l’espoir de jamais se l’attribuer[”]—[“]It is not only necessary to take from the legislature the executive power which would exempt them from the laws; but they should not have even a hope of being ever able to arrogate to themselves that power.”3 To remove this hope from their expectation, it would have been proper, not only to have previously laid down, in a declaration of rights, that these powers should be forever separate and incommunicable; but the frame of the proposed constitution, should have had that separation religiously in view, through all its parts. It is manifest this was not the object of its framers, but, that on the contrary there is a studied mixture of them in the senate as necessary to erect it into that potent aristocracy which it must infallibly produce. In pursuit of this darling object, than which no greater calamity can be brought upon the people, another egregious error in constitutional principles is committed. I mean that of dividing the executive powers, between the senate and the president. Unless more harmony and less ambition should exist between these two executives than ever yet existed between men in power, or than can exist while human nature is as it is: this absurd division must be productive of constant contentions for the lead, must clog the execution of government to a mischievous, and sometimes to a disgraceful degree, and if they should unhappily harmonize in the same objects of ambition, their number and their combined power, would preclude all fear of that responsibility, which is one of the great securities of good, and restraints on bad governments. Upon these principles M. de Lolme has foreseen that “the effect of a division of the executive power is the establishment of absolute power in one of continual contention”; he therefore lays it down, as a general rule “pour q’un etat soit tranquille il faut que le pouvoir executif y soit rèunie”—for the tranquillity of the state it is necessary that the executive power should be in one.4 I will add, that this singlehood of the executive, is indispensably necessary to effective execution, as well as to the responsibility and rectitude of him to whom it is entrusted. By this time I hope it is evident from reason and authority, that in the constitution of the senate there is much cunning and little wisdom; that we have much to fear from it, and little to hope, and then it must necessarily produce a baneful aristocracy, by which the democratic rights of the people will be overwhelmed. [287] It was probably upon this principle that a member of the convention, of high and unexceeded reputation for wisdom and integrity, is said to have emphatically declared, that he would sooner lose his right hand, than put his name to such a constitution:5"
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,11/23/1787,"Letters from a Gentleman in Dutchess County, to his Friend in New-York. In the Conclusion of my First, of the 19th [i.e., 10th] current,2 I promised that Mr. Dickenson, or the famous Author of the Farmer’s Letters, and Doctor Franklin should speak for themselves; I now offer you as a Specimen of the Farmer’s Rhetoric, the second Paragraph of his first Letter, which appears thus—“From my Infancy I was taught to love Humanity and Liberty. Enquiry and Experience have since confirmed my Reverence for the Lessons then given me, by convincing me more fully of their Truth and Excellence. Benevolence towards Mankind excites Wishes for their Welfare, and such Wishes endear the Means of fulfilling them. Those can be found in Liberty alone, and therefore her sacred Cause ought to be espoused by every Man, on every occasion, to the utmost of his Power. As a Charitable, but poor, Person does not withhold his Mite, because he can not relieve all the Distresses of the Miserable; so let not any honest Man suppress his Sentiments concerning Freedom, however small their Influence is likely to be. Perhaps he may touch some Wheel that will have a greater Effect than he expects.”3 What gracious Sentiments, and how sweetly expressed!—But what are Sentiments, or the tenderest Expressions, when not accompanied by corresponding Actions? They certainly render the Author a greater Object of our Pity, if not of Contempt.—How is it possible to reconcile the first Clause of the 9th Section, in the first Article of the new Constitution,4 with such universal Benevolence to all Mankind? Will this Gentleman say, that the Africans do not come within the Description of “Mankind?” If he should, will he be believed?—Besides, he seems to have run counter to a generally received Maxim in educating the rational as well as the irrational Creation; as he acknowledges, that he was early instituted in Virtue, which, now, in advanced Life, he seems either to have forgotten or stiffled? Had Cornwallis, Rawdon, Arnold, or any of the British, Marauding, [292]Butchers, signed such a Clause, there would have been a Consistency; but, for the benevolent Author of the Farmer’s Letters, which every where seem to breathe the pure Spirit of Liberty and Humanity, to lend his once venerated Name, for promoting that which the Framers of the Clause were either ashamed or afraid, openly, to avow, exceeds Credulity itself, were it not for occular Demonstration. Is this the Way by which we are to demonstrate our Gratitude to Providence, for his divine Interposition in our Favor, when oppressed by Great Britain?—Who could have even imagined, that Men lately professing the highest Sense of Justice and the Liberties of Mankind, could so soon and easily be brought to give a Sanction to the greatest Injustice and Violation of those very Liberties? Strange Inconsistency and painful Reflection!—And the more so, when it is considered, that not only Individuals in Europe, as well as in each of these states; but that several of the Nations in Europe have, for some years before the Revolution, been endeavouring to put a Stop to a Trade, which was a Disgrace to the very Name of Christianity itself.—Nay, that Numbers among those whom we so lately considered as Enemies to Liberty, are now using every Means in their Power to abolish Slavery! Will not a contrary Conduct of the States tarnish the Lustre of the American Revolution, by violating the Law of Nations, and entailing endless Servitude on Millions of the human Race, and their unborn Posterity? Can any Person, who is not deeply interested in enslaving this Country, believe, that the Contrivers of such a diabolical Scheme had any Regard for the most sacred Rights of human Nature? It really seems to have been, as Mr. Wilson acknowledged, a mere Matter of Accomodation between the Northern and Southern States; that is, if you will permit us to import Africans as Slaves, we will consent that you may export Americans, as Soldiers;5 for this the new Constitution clearly admits, by the 2d Clause of the 6th Article, which says, “that this Constitution and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land, &c. any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” May not Treaties be immediately entered into with some of the Nations of Europe for assisting them with Troops, which, if they do not enlist voluntarily, may, by this Clause, be detached and transported to the West or East-Indies, &c.? I ask the Doctor’s Pardon, I promised in my first, that he should be permitted to speak for himself in this; but Time will not now admit of it—He shall have the Preference of opening my next. I am, with every Sentiment of Esteem, Dear Sir, Your most Obedient, A COUNTRYMAN. November 17, 1787."

Newspaper,No,A Citizen,,New York Journal,Medium,11/24/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, On reading your Daily Patriotic Register of the 21st inst., a political piece, under the signature of MEDIUM,1 engaged my attention—From the name which the author has taken, I flattered myself, that his writings would have been influenced by candor and impartiality; his declarations in the first paragraph, of his having perused the publications for and against the new constitution, “without bias or prejudice,” and that his researches had been solely directed to discover on which side the greatest reason prevailed—and, his indiscriminate censures of writers (without my stopping to enquire into the justice of them) confirmed my opinion in favor of his performance: you may judge then of my disappointment when I came to the two last paragraphs; these plainly discover that little dependence can be placed on appearances, [304]and that the people ought to guard against the cunning and insidious arts, employed by designing men to mislead and betray them; for, it is evidently discernible, that the name which the writer assumes, and the candor that he effects, were purposely designed the better to carry on the business of deception, and to effect the great end which a certain lordly party have in view—the adoption of the new constitution with all its defects; and, of course, risking the dearest rights of mankind to the precarious chance of being secured by future amendments. In the first place, Medium asserts, that “It may be true, that the constitution is defective, but none have yet been able to prove that it is materially so;” he, however, admits, that it is not accompanied with a bill of rights, which he allows “to be the best security we can have against the encroachments of despotism”—Here it is granted, that the omission of a bill of rights is (whether proved so by other writers or not) “a material defect;”—With what degree of consistency then can he urge “the embracing the constitution as it now stands;” certainly, he cannot be ignorant, that if it is agreed to without “that best security against the encroachments of despotism,” that our liberties must, hereafter, entirely depend upon acts of an imperfect and unequal congressional legislature, which may be repealed at their pleasure, and, whenever it suits their arbitrary designs. The stale and hackneyed reasons, that have been alledged for the adoption of the proposed system, in all its parts, are the only ones made use of by this writer, viz. The impracticability of getting a better, and the anarchy which will ensue its rejection. In order to shew the futility and absurdity of these positions, it may be proper to give the following concise account of the commencement and progress of this business. A convention was appointed by the respective legislatures, at the recommendation of Congress, for the sole purpose of revising and amending the articles of confederation; Congress had no power to concur in any measures for alteration, but such as should be assented to by all the states; nor had the legislatures the least authority to confer powers for the purposes of violating or abridging the state constitutions; the commission of the delegates to the late Federal Convention, consequently, could not, by any possible construction, invest them with powers which Congress and the legislatures themselves did not possess: the business of the conventioneers was then evidently not to form a new constitution for the United States, but to revise and amend the old one, as far as was necessary and consistent with their delegation. It was well understood, that the account of provisions, for the general regulation of commerce, and for ensuring a compliance with requisitions made under the federal compact, were principal causes which induced the appointment of the convention. These being the main objects, the representations, [305]from all the states, were small, principally taken from commercial cities, and composed chiefly of merchants, practitioners of the law, and judicial officers; of the two latter professions, nearly one half of the convention consisted. This imperfect representation of the people, both as to numbers and descriptions, when assembled, shut their doors against their fellow citizens, and laid themselves under obligations of secrecy, and, by keeping from the world a knowledge of the important business which they had assumed upon themselves, they were precluded from all opportunities of receiving light or information, upon so interesting a subject, from the animadversions which their constituents would probably have made upon the different points under their deliberation. Under these unfavorable circumstances, this new constitution was formed, and it must therefore be considered as an unauthorized essay, which can only receive sanction from the assent of the people; it has already become the subject of general discussion, and, besides the omission of a bill of rights (which even Medium admits to be essential) many other radical defects have been pointed out; but, instead of attempting to amend them, it is insisted that it must, for the groundless and puerile reasons above-mentioned, be accepted in toto. What is there in the nature of our situation that imposes this disagreeable necessity upon us? Is it probable, that we shall ever be in a situation, in which we can with more temper and greater safety, deliberate upon this momentous concern than at present? From abroad, we have nothing to fear—the interesting affairs of the European powers will engage their attention beyond the atlantic—at home, we are in a state of perfect tranquility—for, although there are defects in the existing articles of confederation, yet the governments of the different states have energy sufficient to command obedience to their laws, and preserve domestic peace; America has not been subjected to as many tumults and disasters since the conclusion of the war, as countries, of an earlier foundation, have suffered in the same space of time. Some of the states have, already, with great calmness and temper, directed conventions of the people to assemble and take the proposed constitution into consideration—they ought, and it is unquestionably their duty to give every article a free and fair discussion; it would be inconsistent with, and derogatory to, every idea of the rights of freemen, to presume that they must approve of such parts as, in their opinions, are improper and dangerous, or, on the other hand, that they would reject what merited their approbation—it should also be their duty, to point out such amendments and alterations, as to them appear necessary and salutary—and they or the legislatures, should appoint delegates to compose a new general convention; the members of which, being furnished with the remarks of the respective state conventions, will be [306]enabled to form a system much less exceptionable, more perfect, and coincident with the wishes of the people; by this means the present animosities and divisions, which now prevail will, in all probability, be healed, and a government introduced that will engage the attachment, promote the felicity, and receive the support, of all ranks of people. If the advocates, for the unqualified adoption of the new constitution, could be induced to divest themselves of prejudice, and reflect seriously and candidly, perhaps they would discover greater danger of anarchy and civil discord through their unjustifiable endeavors to establish a government (universally allowed to be defective) than by a concurrence in this practicable and rational mode of proceedure. They ought deliberately to consider, whether the proposed constitution will ensure to the people all those great advantages they are led to expect from the encomiums which its advocates so lavishly bestow upon it, in order to obtain its establishment; for, if the contrary (which is predicted by many) should happen, and the people, instead of having their happiness and interest promoted, find themselves deprived of their invaluable liberties, and their burdens increased by an expensive government, the inevitable consequences will be anarchy and discord, which may prove, when beyond the power of remedy, dangerous to the community, and dreadfully fatal to the authors of their deception.

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,11/29/1787,"To the People of the State of New-York. There can be no free government where the people are not possessed of the power of making the laws by which they are governed, either in their own persons, or by others substituted in their stead. Experience has taught mankind, that legislation by representatives is the most eligible, and the only practicable mode in which the people of any country can exercise this right, either prudently or beneficially. But then, it is a matter of the highest importance, in forming this representation, that it be so constituted as to be capable of understanding the true interests of the society for which it acts, and so disposed as to pursue the good and happiness of the people as its ultimate end. The object of every free government is the public good, and all lesser interests yield to it. That of every tyrannical government, is the happiness and aggrandisement of one, or a few, and to this the public felicity, and every other interest must submit.—The reason of this difference in these governments is obvious. The first is so constituted as to collect the views and wishes of the whole people in that of their rulers, while the latter is so framed as to separate the interests of the governors from that of the governed. The principle of self love, therefore, that will influence the one to promote the good of the whole, will prompt the other to follow its own private advantage. The great art, therefore, in forming a good constitution, appears to be this, so to frame it, as that those to whom the power is committed shall be subject to the same feelings, and aim at the same objects as the people do, [314]who transfer to them their authority. There is no possible way to effect this but by an equal, full and fair representation; this, therefore, is the great desideratum in politics. However fair an appearance any government may make, though it may possess a thousand plausible articles and be decorated with ever so many ornaments, yet if it is deficient in this essential principle of a full and just representation of the people, it will be only like a painted sepulcher—For, without this it cannot be a free government; let the administration of it be good or ill, it still will be a government, not according to the will of the people, but according to the will of a few. To test this new constitution then, by this principle, is of the last importance—It is to bring it to the touch-stone of national liberty, and I hope I shall be excused, if, in this paper, I pursue the subject commenced in my last number,2 to wit, the necessity of an equal and full representation in the legislature.—In that, I showed that it was not equal, because the smallest states are to send the same number of members to the senate as the largest, and, because the slaves, who afford neither aid or defence to the government, are to encrease the proportion of members. To prove that it was not a just or adequate representation, it was urged, that so small a number could not resemble the people, or possess their sentiments and dispositions. That the choice of members would commonly fall upon the rich and great, while the middling class of the community would be excluded. That in so small a representation there was no security against bribery and corruption. The small number which is to compose this legislature, will not only expose it to the danger of that kind of corruption, and undue influence, which will arise from the gift of places of honor and emolument, or the more direct one of bribery, but it will also subject it to another kind of influence no less fatal to the liberties of the people, though it be not so flagrantly repugnant to the principles of rectitude. It is not to be expected that a legislature will be found in any country that will not have some of its members, who will pursue their private ends, and for which they will sacrifice the public good. Men of this character are, generally, artful and designing, and frequently possess brilliant talents and abilities; they commonly act in concert, and agree to share the spoils of their country among them; they will keep their object ever in view, and follow it with constancy. To effect their purpose, they will assume any shape, and, Proteus like,3 mould themselves into any form—where they find members proof against direct bribery or gifts of offices, they will endeavor to mislead their minds by specious and false reasoning, to impose upon their unsuspecting honesty by an affectation of zeal for the public good; they will form juntos, and hold [315]out-door meetings; they will operate upon the good nature of their opponents, by a thousand little attentions, and seize them into compliance by the earnestness of solicitation. Those who are acquainted with the manner of conducting business in public assemblies, know how prevalent art and address are in carrying a measure, even over men of the best intentions, and of good understanding. The firmest security against this kind of improper and dangerous influence, as well as all other, is a strong and numerous representation: in such a house of assembly, so great a number must be gained over, before the private views of individuals could be gratified that there could be scarce a hope of success. But in the federal assembly, seventeen men are all that is necessary to pass a law. It is probable, it will seldom happen that more than twenty-five will be requisite to form a majority, when it is considered what a number of places of honor and emolument will be in the gift of the executive, the powerful influence that great and designing men have over the honest and unsuspecting, by their art and address, their soothing manners and civilities, and their cringing flattery, joined with their affected patriotism; when these different species of influence are combined, it is scarcely to be hoped that a legislature, composed of so small a number, as the one proposed by the new constitution, will long resist their force. A farther objection against the feebleness of the representation is, that it will not possess the confidence of the people. The execution of the laws in a free government must rest on this confidence, and this must be founded on the good opinion they entertain of the framers of the laws. Every government must be supported, either by the people having such an attachment to it, as to be ready, when called upon, to support it, or by a force at the command of the government, to compel obedience. The latter mode destroys every idea of a free government; for the same force that may be employed to compel obedience to good laws, might, and probably would be used to wrest from the people their constitutional liberties.—Whether it is practicable to have a representation for the whole union sufficiently numerous to obtain that confidence which is necessary for the purpose of internal taxation, and other powers to which this proposed government extends, is an important question. I am clearly of opinion, it is not, and therefore I have stated this in my first number,4 as one of the reasons against going into so an entire consolidation of the states—one of the most capital errors in the system, is that of extending the powers of the federal government to objects to which it is not adequate, which it cannot exercise without endangering public liberty, and which it is not necessary they should possess, in order to preserve the union and manage our national concerns; of this, however, I shall treat more fully [316]in some future paper—But, however this may be, certain it is, that the representation in the legislature is not so formed as to give reasonable ground for public trust. In order for the people safely to repose themselves on their rulers, they should not only be of their own choice. But it is requisite they should be acquainted with their abilities to manage the public concerns with wisdom. They should be satisfied that those who represent them are men of integrity, who will pursue the good of the community with fidelity; and will not be turned aside from their duty by private interest, or corrupted by undue influence; and that they will have such a zeal for the good of those whom they represent, as to excite them to be deligent in their service; but it is impossible the people of the United States should have sufficient knowledge of their representatives, when the numbers are so few, to acquire any rational satisfaction on either of these points. The people of this state will have very little acquaintance with those who may be chosen to represent them; a great part of them will, probably, not know the characters of their own members, much less that of a majority of those who will compose the fœderal assembly; they will consist of men, whose names they have never heard, and of whose talents and regard for the public good, they are total strangers to; and they will have no persons so immediately of their choice so near them, of their neighbours and of their own rank in life, that they can feel themselves secure in trusting their interests in their hands. The representatives of the people cannot, as they now do, after they have passed laws, mix with the people, and explain to them the motives which induced the adoption of any measure, point out its utility, and remove objections or silence unreasonable clamours against it.—The number will be so small that but a very few of the most sensible and respectable yeomanry of the country can ever have any knowledge of them: being so far removed from the people, their station will be elevated and important, and they will be considered as ambitious and designing. They will not be viewed by the people as part of themselves, but as a body distinct from them, and having separate interests to pursue; the consequence will be, that a perpetual jealousy will exist in the minds of the people against them; their conduct will be narrowly watched; their measures scrutinized; and their laws opposed, evaded, or reluctantly obeyed. This is natural, and exactly corresponds with the conduct of individuals towards those in whose hands they intrust important concerns. If the person confided in, be a neighbour with whom his employer is intimately acquainted, whose talents, he knows, are sufficient to manage the business with which he is charged, his honesty and fidelity unsuspected, and his friendship and zeal for the service of his principal unquestionable, he will commit his affairs into his hands [317]with unreserved confidence, and feel himself secure; all the transactions of the agent will meet with the most favorable construction, and the measures he takes will give satisfaction. But, if the person employed be a stranger, whom he has never seen, and whose character for ability or fidelity he cannot fully learn—If he is constrained to choose him, because it was not in his power to procure one more agreeable to his wishes, he will trust him with caution, and be suspicious of all his conduct. If then this government should not derive support from the good will of the people, it must be executed by force, or not executed at all; either case would lead to the total destruction of liberty.—The convention seemed aware of this, and have therefore provided for calling out the militia to execute the laws of the union. If this system was so framed as to command that respect from the people, which every good free government will obtain, this provision was unnecessary—the people would support the civil magistrate. This power is a novel one, in free governments—these have depended for the execution of the laws on the Posse Comitatus, and never raised an idea, that the people would refuse to aid the civil magistrate in executing those laws they themselves had made. I shall now dismiss the subject of the incompetency of the representation, and proceed, as I promised, to shew, that, impotent as it is, the people have no security that they will enjoy the exercise of the right of electing this assembly, which, at best, can be considered but as the shadow of representation. ⟨By section 4, article 1, the Congress are authorized, at any time, by law, to make, or alter, regulations respecting the time, place, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, except as to the places of choosing senators. By this clause the right of election itself, is, in a great measure, transferred from the people to their rulers.—One would think, that if any thing was necessary to be made a fundamental article of the original compact, it would be, that of fixing the branches of the legislature, so as to put it out of its power to alter itself by modifying the election of its own members at will and pleasure. When a people once resign the privilege of a fair election, they clearly have none left worth contending for.⟩ It is clear that, under this article, the federal legislature may institute such rules respecting elections as to lead to the choice of one description of men. The weakness of the representation, tends but too certainly to confer on the rich and well-born, all honours: but the power granted in this article, may be so exercised, as to secure it almost beyond a possibility of controul. The proposed Congress may make the whole state one district, and direct, that the capital (the city of New-York, for instance) shall be the place for holding the election; the [318]consequence would be, that none but men of the most elevated rank in society would attend, and they would as certainly choose men of their own class; as it is true what the Apostle Paul saith, that “no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it.”5—They may declare that those members who have the greatest number of votes, shall be considered as duly elected; the consequence would be that the people, who are dispersed in the interior parts of the state, would give their votes for a variety of candidates, while any order, or profession, residing in populous places, by uniting their interests, might procure whom they pleased to be chosen—and by this means the representatives of the state may be elected by one tenth part of the people who actually vote. This may be effected constitutionally, and by one of those silent operations which frequently takes place without being noticed, but which often produces such changes as entirely to after a government, subvert a free constitution, and rivet the chains on a free people before they perceive they are forged. Had the power of regulating elections been left under the direction of the state legislatures, where the people are not only nominally but substantially represented, it would have been secure; but if it was taken out of their hands, it surely ought to have been fixed on such a basis as to have put it out of the power of the federal legislature to deprive the people of it by law. Provision should have been made for marking out the states into districts, and for choosing, by a majority of votes, a person out of each of them of permanent property and residence in the district which he was to represent. ⟨If the people of America will submit to a constitution that will vest in the hands of any body of men a right to deprive them by law of the privilege of a fair election, they will submit to almost any thing. Reasoning with them will be in vain, they must be left until they are brought to reflection by feeling oppression—they will then have to wrest from their oppressors, by a strong hand; that which they now possess, and which they may retain if they will exercise but a moderate share of prudence and firmness. I know it is said that the dangers apprehended from this clause are merely imaginary, that the proposed general legislature will be disposed to regulate elections upon proper principles, and to use their power with discretion, and to promote the public good. On this, I would observe, that constitutions are not so necessary to regulate the conduct of good rulers as to restrain that of bad ones.—Wise and good men will exercise power so as to promote the public happiness under any form of government. If we are to take it for granted, that those who administer the government under this system, will always pay proper attention to the rights and interests of the people, nothing more was [319]necessary than to say who should be invested with the powers of government, and leave them to exercise it at will and pleasure. Men are apt to be deceived both with respect to their own dispositions and those of others.⟩ Though this truth is proved by almost every page of the history of nations, to wit, that power, lodged in the hands of rulers to be used at discretion, is almost always exercised to the oppression of the people, and the aggrandizement of themselves; yet most men think if it was lodged in their hands they would not employ it in this manner.—Thus when the prophet Elisha told Hazael, “I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel; their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men, wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.” Hazael had no idea that he ever should be guilty of such horrid cruelty, and said to the prophet, “Is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing.” Elisha, answered, “The Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king of Syria.”6 The event proved, that Hazael only wanted an opportunity to perpetrate these enormities without restraint, and he had a disposition to do them, though he himself knew it not."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/29/1787,"Sir, In my former observations on your speech, to your fellow-citizens,1 explanatory and defensive of the new constitution; it has appeared, by arguments to my judgment unanswerable, that by ratifying the constitution, as the convention proposed it, the people will leave the liberty of the press, and the trial by jury, in civil cases, to the mercy of their rulers—that the project is to burthen them with enormous taxes, in order to raise and maintain armies, for the purposes of ambition and arbitrary power—that this power is to be vested in an aristocratic senate, who will either be themselves the tyrants, or the support of tyranny, in a president, who will know how to manage them, so as to make that body at once the instrument and the shield of his absolute authority.—Even the Roman Emperors found it necessary to have a senate for this purpose. To compass this object, we have seen powers, in every branch of government, in violation of all principle, and all safety condensed in this aristocratic senate: we have seen the representative, or democratic branch, weakened exactly in proportion to the strength[en]ing the aristocratic, or, what means the same thing, and will be more pleasing to your ear, Mr. Wilson, the republican branch. We have seen with what cunning the power of impeachment is apparently given to the representative of the people, but really to the senate; since, as they advise these measures of government, which experience has shewn, are the general matters of impunity the executive officers will be sure of impeachment when they act in conformity to their will. Impeachment will therefore have no terrors, but for those who displease or oppose the senate. Let us suppose that the privy councils who advise the executive government in England, were vested with the sole power of trying impeachments; would any man say that this would not render that body absolute; and impeachment to all popular purposes, negatory? I shall appeal to those very citizens, Mr. Wilson, whom you was misleading, for the propriety of what I am going to observe. They know that their constitution was democratic—that it secured the powers of government in the body of the people. They have seen an aristocratical party rise up against this constitution, and without the aid of such a senate, but from the mere influence of wealth, however unduly obtained, they have seen this aristocracy, under the originatical title of republicans, procure such a preference in the legislature, as to appoint a majority of the state members in the late convention, out of their body.2 Had such a senate, as they have now proposed, been part of your constitution, [321]would the popular part of it, have been in effect more than a name. Can your fellow citizens then doubt that these men planned this senate, to effect the very purpose which has been the constant object of their endeavors, that is to overthrow the present constitution. And can you, O citizens of Philadelphia, so soon forget the constitution which you formed, for which you fought, which you have solemnly engaged to defend—can you so soon forget all this, as to be the willing ministers of that ambition, which aims only at making you its footstool—the confirmers of that constitution, which gives your aristocratic enemies their wish, and must trample your state constitution in the dust. Reflect a moment—who wish to erect an aristocracy among you—Mr. Wilson and his party; who were your delegates in framing the constitution now proposed to you—Mr. Wilson, and his party; who harangues you to smooth its passage to your approbation—Mr. Wilson; who have you chosen to approve of it in your state convention—Mr. Wilson.—O sense where is your guard! shame where is your blush3 the intention of a state convention is, that a work of so great moment to your welfare, should undergo an examination by another set of men, uninfluenced by partiality or prejudice in its favor. And for this purpose you are weak enough to send a man, who was in the former convention, and who has not only signed his approbation of it, but stands forward as an agitator for it: is this man unprejudiced? would any man who did not suffer party to overcome all sense of rectitude, solicit or accept so improper a trust? He knows, in the line of his profession, that the having given an opinion upon the same question is a constant ground of challenge to a juryman. And does he think that this question is of less importance and ought less to be guarded against partiality and prejudice, than a common jury cause? He knows that a conscientious man will not sit as a juryman twice on the same cause: and is he in this most momentous cause, less conscientious than a common juryman? What are we to expect from the work of such hands? But you must permit me to lay before you, from your own transactions, farther proofs of Mr. Wilson’s consistency, and of his sacred attention to your rights, when he counsels you to adopt the new constitution. You know that he was one of the convention that formed, and recommended to you, your state constitution. Read what is there laid down as a fundamental principle of liberty—“As standing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up.”4 Read now what this identical Mr. Wilson says to you in his speech—“This constitution, it has been farther urged, is of a pernicious tendency, because it tolerates a standing army in time of peace. This has always been a topic of popular declamation, and yet I do not know a nation [322]in the world, which has not found it necessary and useful to maintain the appearance of strength, in a season of the most profound peace.” What a change of tone is here.—Formerly the mischief of standing armies was of sufficient moment, to find a place in a most solemn recognition of the fundamental rights of the people; standing armies were dangerous to liberty; but now they are only a topic of popular declamation, and are both useful and necessary in a season of the most profound tranquility:—O citizens of Philadelphia! do your hear, do you read, do you reflect? can you believe that the man means either wisely or honestly, who thus palpably contradicts himself, who treats with such levity, what your constitution declares to be one of your most sacred rights; and who betrays so little knowledge of ancient and modern history, as not to know, that some of the freest republics in the world, never kept up a standing army in time of peace! Can you, O deluded men, not see that the object of all this, is to fix upon you, with your own consent, a strong government that will enable a few proud, intriguing, aristocratical men, to make you the instruments of their avarice and ambition, and trample upon your privileges at pleasure. Your privileges, did I say, I beg your pardon; after a surrender of every thing on your part, into the hands of a few, their pleasure will be your only privileges. I beg you will pardon me, Mr. Wilson, for this digression: it is not a pleasant one, and I wish the cause of it had never existed. We will return, if you please, to your speech. “When we reflect, you say, how various are the laws, commerce, habits, population, and extent, of the confederated states, this evidence of mutual concession and accommodation ought rather to command a generous applause, than to excite a jealousy and reproach. For my part, my admiration can only be equalled by my astonishment in beholding so perfect a system formed from such heterogeneous materials.” What a rhapsody is here; it certainly must have excited equal admiration and astonishment in your audience, and called forth those loud and unanimous testimonies of applause which Doctor Panegyric tells us, accompanied your speech.5 Nil admirari,6 Mr. Wilson, is a wise lesson, and when you recover from your admiration and astonishment which are always incompatible with truth and reason; I shall ask you what union in the world is so similar in their laws, commerce, habits, population and extent? Is there such difference between Rhode-Island and Virginia, as between Holland and Overyssel; between Massachusetts and Georgia, as between Berne and Switzs? Do not the several states harmonize in trial by jury of the vicinage; taxation by representation; habeas corpus; religious toleration; freedom of the press; separation of the legislative, executive and judicial functions. Are not these the great principles on which every [323]constitution is founded? In these the laws and habits of the several states are uniform. But I suppose, because the citizens of New-York are not in the habit of being so ostentatious as those of Philadelphia, nor its merchants, of being such speculators in commerce as to fill the papers with bankruptcies; because in Carolina they are in the habit of eating rice, and in Maryland of eating homony; therefore the materials are heterogeneous, out of which this perfect, system; his subject of amazement, was formed. What was this wonder working concession and accommodation? If they consisted in giving up, or hazarding any of the above fundamental principles of liberty, which I confess seems probable, because some furious spirits in the convention, and such there were, insisted upon it, such conduct may command your generous applause; but trust me, sir, when the people come to feel that their rights have been so basely betrayed by those they trusted, it will command a general execration: And here I cannot avoid remarking on what I have heard and for the truth of which I appeal to you. It is that a member of the late convention said, not very honorably distinguished for his moral or political virtue, admonished his associates that, unless they carried the constitution through before there was time for considering it, there would be no probability of its being adopted.7 When I couple this profligate declaration, with the equally profligate measures taken by some persons to force it down in Philadelphia, and with the indecent speed with which others posted to Congress, and then to their several states, to hurry it forward8—I confess I cannot help apprehending that such advice has not only [been] given, but followed. You would next induce us, Mr. Wilson, to believe, that the state sovereignties will not be annihilated, if the general one be established as the convention recommends. Your reason for this is as curious as it is conclusive. Because the state legislatures must nominate the electors of the President once in four years, and chuse a third of the Senate once in two years; therefore they will continue to be sovereign. Sovereignty then consists in electing the members of a sovereignty; to make laws—preside over the administration of justice—command the militia, or force of the state—these I suppose, do not constitute its sovereignty, for these are totally taken away, and yet you are clear the sovereignty remains. Did you think, Sir, that you was speaking to men or to children, when you hazarded such futile observations. Nor are they compensated by the very profound erudition you display in defining the meaning of the word corporation. In common parlance we should call this egregious pedantry. Such is the anxiety manifested by the framers of the proposed constitution, for the utter extinction of the state sovereignties, that they were not content with taking from them every [324]attribute of sovereignty, but would not leave them even the name.—Therefore, in the very commencement they prescribe this remarkable declaration—We the People of the United States. When the whole people of America shall be thus recognized by their own solemn act, as the people of the United States, I beseech you Sir, to tell us over whom the sovereignty, you say you leave to the several states, is to operate. Did the generous confidence of your fellow citizens, deserve this mockery of their understandings; or inebriated with so unusual a thing as popularity, did you think that every rhapsody you uttered, would be received as reason? That you may not expose yourself again on this subject, give me leave to recommend to you to read Mr. Locke, in whom you will find that sovereignty consists in three things—the legislative, executive, and negociating powers, all which your constitution takes absolutely away from the several states. In Barbeyrac’s Puffendorf, you will find these words, “La souvèraintee entant quelle prescrit des regles generales pour la conduite de la vie civile, s’appelle pouvoir legislatif—entant qu’elle prononce sur les demeles des citoiens, conformement a ces regles, pouvoir judiciaire—entant q’uelle arme les citoiens contre un ennemie etranger, ou qu’elle leur ordonne de mettre fin aux acts d’hostilitès; pouvoir de faire la guerre et la paix; entant qu’elle se choisit des Ministres pour lui aider a prendre soin des affaires publiques; pouvoir d’etablir des magistrats. The sovereignty, inasmuch as it prescribes general rules for the conduct of civil life, is called the legislative power—in deciding controversies among its citizens, conformably to those laws it is called the judiciary power—in arming its citizens against a foreign enemy, or ordering them to cease hostilities; it has the power of war and peace—the appointment of officers to aid it in the case of the public, is the power of establishing magistrates.”9 Now, Sir, all these attributes of sovereignty, being vested exclusively in your new government, is it not a mockery of common sense to tell us, the state sovereignties are not annihilated? and yet you undertake to prove, that upon their existence depends the existence of the federal plan—and when this mighty undertaking is explained, it is because they must meet once in two years to elect part of the federal sovereignty. O fie! O fie!10 Mr. Wilson! you had yet some character to lose, why would you hazard it in this manner? On the subject of taxation, in which powers are to be given so largely by the new constitution, you lull our fears of abuse by venturing to predict “that the great revenue of the United States must and always will be raised by impost”—and you elevate our hopes by holding out, “the reviving and supporting the national credit.” If you have any other plan for this, than by raising money upon the people to pay the interest [325]of the national debt, your ingenuity will deserve our thanks. Supposing however, that raising money is necessary to payment of the interest, and such payment requisite to support the credit of the union; let us see how much will be necessary for that end, and how far the impost will supply what we want. Dollars. The arrearages of French and Spanish interest amount now to 1,500,000 Interest and instalments of do. for 1788, 850,227 Support of government, and its departments, for 1788, 500,000 Arrears and anticipations of 1787, 300,000 Interest of domestic debt. 500,000 4,650,227 The new Congress then, supposing it to get into operation towards October, 1788, will have to provide for this sum, and for the additional sum of 3,000,000 at least for the ensuing year; which together will make the sum of 7,650,227.11 Now let us see how the impost will answer this: Congress have furnished us with their estimate of the produce of the whole imports of America at five per cent. And that is 800,000 dollars:12 there will remain to provide for, by other taxes, 6,850,227. We know too, that our imports diminish yearly, and from the nature of things must continue to diminish; and consequently that the above estimate of the produce of the impost, will in all probability, fall much short of the supposed sum. But even without this, it must appear, that you was either intentionally misleading your hearers, or very little acquainted with the subject when you ventured to predict, that the great revenue of the United States would always flow from the impost. The estimate above is from the publications of Congress, and I presume is right. But the sum stated, is necessary to be raised by the new government, in order to answer the expectations they have raised, is not all. The state debts, independent of what each owes to the United States, amount to about 30,000,000 dollars;13 the annual interest of this is 1,800,000. It will be expected, that the new government will provide for this also; and such expectation is founded, not only on the promise you hold forth, of its reviving and supporting public credit among us, but also on this unavoidable principle of justice, that is the new government takes away the impost, and other substantial taxes, from the produce of which the several states paid the interest of their debt, or funded the paper with which they paid it. The new government must find ways [326]and means of supplying that deficiency, or in other words of paying the interest in hard money, for in paper as now, it cannot, without a violation of the principles it boasts, attempt to pay. The sum then which it must annually raise in specie, after the first year, cannot be less than 4,800,000:14 at present, there is not one half of this sum in specie raised in all the states; and yet the complaints of intolerable taxes has produced one rebellion, and will be mainly operative in the adoption of your constitution.—How you will get this sum is inconceivable, and yet get it you must, or lose all credit. With magnificent promises you have bought golden opinions of all sorts of people, and with gold you must answer them."
Other,No,Interrogator,,,Publius,12/2/1787,"Sir, As you appear to me, from your much laboured & multitudinous Publications, to be Solicitor General for the New Constitution (perhaps with a View of being Attorney General Or Ld. Chief-Justice under it) and have addressed all your Publications, in it’s Favour, “To the People of the State of New York”—in particular; I beg your Permission, as one of those very Persons, to request the Solution of a few plain Questions, which (I imagine) are easily solved by a Gentleman of your Knowledge and Identity.— This Favour, I think, you can not, reasonably, deny me, especially when you reflect, that you, yourself, have been the Means of inducing it; for, had you not addressed your Publications to me, I should not, now, interrogate you. Will you please to reconcile the 1st. Clause of the 9th. Section, of the first Article1 of the New Constitution (or your political Creed) with an Assertion of yours, at the latter End of the 3rd [10th]2 Paragraph, [343]in the Conclusion of your 15th Number, where, you say—“We must extend the Authority of the Union to the Persons of the Citizens—the only proper Objects of Government.”3—Taking you at your Word, what Right, or even a Pretension to Right, could the late Convention have had, for extendg the Authority of Government, had they really been properly authorised to frame a Constitution, to Importing, enslaving and murdering the Africans, who, certainly, are not Citizens of the United States? Could not they complete the Measure of their Iniquity deceiving and enslaving their Fellow Citizens, without having Recourse to the Revival of that which all Christendom are ashamed of, and wish to suppress In the latter Part of the next Paragraph you assert, that—“In an Association where the general Authority is confined to collective Bodies of the Communities that compose it, every Branch of the Laws must involve a State of War, and military Execution must become the only Instrument of civil Obedience. Such a State of Things can certainly not deserve the Name of Government, nor would any prudent Man chuse to commit his Happiness to it.”—And does not the Clause referred to, involve a State of War and military Execution to the Persons who are the objects of it?—Nay, does it not do much worse? Does it not involve a Dissolution of all the tenderest Ties of Nature by an endless Servitude, the severest Labour, and all its horrid Consequences? that the Wantonness of a lazy. Lordly southern Tobacco—Rice or Indigo, Planter can suggest, or his savage Overseer execute, and that without any Regard to Age, Sex or Condition? You say—“Such a State of Things can certainly not deserve the Name of Government”—And I ask, by what Name ought the Government, which you are advocating, to be called, when founded in Fraud, Violence Murder and Slavery?—You say—“Nor would any prudent Man chuse to commit his Happiness to it,”—And I ask, would any Man whose Pride, Avarice or Lust of Power had not gotten the Better of his Humanity and Love of Justice, advocate the Cause of such an Institution as the late Convention have exhibited—I care not who were the Suggesters, Promoters or Framers of that Clause, nor who has lent his Name to the Adoption of it. I pronounce it to be fraught with every Species of Wickedness. Cruelty and Injustice, of which the Mind of Man is susceptible.—Nor do I believe that the Contrivers of it had, at that Time, either the Love of God, or Man, in their Hearts. When, in the Middle of the 5th. [12th] Paragraph you ask—“Why has Government been instituted at all?” And answer—“Because the Passions of Men will not conform to the Dictates of Reason and Justice, [344]without Constraint.”4—Your Conduct seems to me, very much like that of a Prostitute recommending Chastity to her Sex, lest they should divide the Profits of the Business with her, as one that thought herself intitled to an exclusive Right to ruin her Adherents.—What else can you there mean by prostituting the sacred Names of Reason and Justice? Have the Framers of that disgraceful & wicked Clause, or their Adherents, any Pretensions to speak of Reason and Justice, unless it be to deceive?—But, when you ask the following Question—“Has it been found that Bodies of Men act with more Rectitude or greater Disinterestedness than Individuals?”—And answer—“The Contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate Observers of the Conduct of Mankind; and the Inference is founded upon obvious Reasons. Regard to Reputation has a less active Influence, when the Infamy of a bad Action is to be divided among a Number, than when it is to fall singly upon one. A Spirit of Faction which is apt to mingle its Poison in the Deliberations of all Bodies of Men, will often hurry the Persons of whom they are composed into Improprieties and Excesses, for which they would blush, in a private Capacity.”5—You really speak as tho’ you had been a Member of the late Convention,6 and there experienced, in your own Person, all the Improprieties and Excesses which a Spirit of Faction could produce by mingling its Poison in your Deliberations, and which you so feelingly and emphatically now describe. I shall be happy to know whether you had an eye generally, to the Conduct of the Convention, [and?] to the particular Conduct of one of its Members or Both,—when you assert, in the 5th. Period, of the 6th [13th] Paragraph that—“Power controled or abused is almost always the Rival and Enemy of that Power by which it is controlled or abridged.”—For, if one may be permitted to use some of your own Words, there seems to have been a very considerable excentric Tendency in the inferiour Orbs of Both to fly off from the common Centre. But this you have very justly & laconicly accounted by saying—“It has its origin in the love of Power.”7—This was as [– – –] and you see that I am willing to allow you all the Credit which it merits. I hope your Patience is not quite exhausted, because the Joes8 have not [appeared?], as I yet wish to learn of so able an Informant, by what Authority the Delegate from this State to the late Convention acceded to their Proceedings? Have you ever seen, heard, or understood that the Legislature, or either Branch of it, impowered or encouraged him, directly or indirectly, to the accession? Or, have you ever seen, or heard of, Petitions from a Majority of the Freeholders and Inhabitants of this State, requesting a new Constitution for the U. States? Or, have you any official or authentic Documents [345]to prove that any of the States in the Union requested an entire new Constitution by a Consolidation of the Whole?— If you can Answer all or any of these Questions in the Affirmative, I beg you will be so condescending; as I really wish for Information, and have Reason to think, that many others are in the like Situation.— If you do not, comply with such reasonable Requisitions, you will please to remember that you subject yourself and Cause to some very unfavourable Inferences.— Finally, as you appear to be much bloated by a vain Opinion of a little Learning and Knowledge, and not infrequently to have written like a Person, who considered himself as the sole Proprietor of all common Sense, permit me to remind you of the Fable of the Ox and the Frog,9 who, ambitious to make as great an Appearance as the Former, kept straining its lankey Sides till it burst, which, must be the Fate of every Individual whatever, that attempts to put his scanty Knowledge or Acquirements in Competition with the Aggregate Knowledge of a Nation.—Only reflect on how little you know of your own mental and corporeal Composition, as well as of what daily and momently contributes to your Support and Existence or, that many of the most simple Plebians, or Mechanicks, can teach you some of the first Principles of Philosophy. Or how very little you know of any Thing, when compared with what is unknow[n] to you and Thousands who are much wiser, & you will not find much Cause to value yourself on your Omniscience. You can not convince “The People of the State of N.Y.” nor a Majority of them, that they had better make a Surrender of all their most invaluable Rights, and Property, into the Hands [of] Power, and then to receive as much back as their Lords & Masters may think fit to spare. It is not impossible but your Judgement may have become the Dupe of your Vanity; but you may rely, that you can not Nor can you, by the utmost Effort of all the Rhetoric & Logic you are Master of, persuade the World that either you are, or the Convention, were actuated by the true Principles of Patriotism, or Philanthropy—Posterity will speak of it as it deserves, when you and they are reduced to Dust and Silence”10—P.S. How would you relish making a Trip to Algiers in Company with the Authors, Promoters and Abbettors of the Section already mentioned, and there spend the Remainder of your Days at the Chain and Oar or to be driven like Cattle into the interior Parts of the Country and there distributed as might best suit the Captors or Purchasers &c.? Yet Monsters in Wickedness as you and they are! Believe me, I do not wish you nor them a worse Fate, than to experience it long enough to produce a permanent Contrition."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,12/3/1787,"Letters from a Gentleman in Dutchess County, to his Friend in New-York. Dear Sir, My second Letter2 was concluded by a Promise that Dr. Franklin should have the Preference in this. However, I do not know, whether, upon the Whole, I ought not to make the Doctor some Acknowledgement, as he does not appear, all Circumstances considered, quite so inconsistent as Mr. Dickenson, or the Author of the Farmer’s Letters, who, before this violent Attack on the present Confederation, has not, to my Knowledge, ever been concerned in subverting the Rights or Liberties of the People. For the sake of America and Humanity, I wish the same could, with Truth, be said of his Colleague, the Doctor, who, as you will presently perceive by his own Words, as well as by Mr. Dickenson’s, has long been endeavouring to reconcile this Country to a standing Army, and, I think, an episcopal Hierarchy also; but, the Latter you will be better able to judge of, when you hear him speak for himself, and I do not wish to misrepresent a single Syllable to the Prejudice of him, or any other Person. Perhaps it may not be amiss to acquaint you, that the Doctor’s Speech, of which I am going to transcribe a Part, was not an extemporaneous one; but written in Philadelphia, April the 12th, 1764, as appears by the Date, by Way of Letter, to a Friend in the Country, and afterwards published under the Title of “Cool Thoughts on the present Situation of our public Affairs.”3 He thus begins—“Sir, your Apology was unnecessary. It will be no ⟨Trouble,⟩ but a ⟨pleasure⟩, if I can give you the Satisfaction you desire. [348] I shall therefore immediately communicate to you my Motives for approving the Proposal of endeavouring to obtain a ⟨Royal Government⟩ in Exchange for this of the Proprietaries; with such Answers to the Objections you mention, as, in my Opinion, fully obviate them.”4—Then follows, to the 15th Page, a Number of Observations, &c. on the Conduct of the Proprietaries and their Government, &c. with neither of which, at this Time, have we any Concern. But the 2d. Paragraph in the Page mentioned above, exhibits a Case more in Point, if I may be allowed the Phrase, and begins thus,—⟨“It is farther objected, you tell me, that if we have a Royal Government, we must have with it a Bishop, and a Spiritual Court, and must pay Tythes to support an Episcopal Clergy.⟩ A Bishop for America has been long talked of in England, and probably from the apparent Necessity of the Thing, will sooner or later be appointed; because a Voyage to England for Ordination, is extreamly inconvenient and expensive to the young Clergy educated in America; and the Episcopal Churches and Clergy in these Colonies cannot so conveniently be governed and regulated by a Bishop residing in England, as by one resided among those committed to his Care. But this Event will happen neither sooner nor later for our being, or not being, under a Royal Government. And the spiritual Court, if the Bishop should hold one, can have no Authority only with his own People, &c.”5—The 2d Paragraph, in the 16th Page, I believe you will readily allow to be more to the Purpose, it being less equivocal; as the Doctor, in his usual Manner, avows his Sentiments, in the following Words—“That ⟨we shall have a standing Army to maintain,⟩ is another Bugbear raised to terrify us from endeavouring to obtain a King’s Government. It is very possible that the Crown may think it necessary to keep Troops in America henceforward, to maintain its Conquests, and defend the Colonies; and that the Parliament may establish some Revenue arising out of the American Trade to be applied towards supporting those Troops. It is possible too, that we may, after a few Years Experience, be generally very well satisfied with the Measure, from the steady Protection it will afford us against foreign Enemies, and the Security of internal Peace among ourselves without the Expence or Trouble of a Militia. But assure yourself, my Friend, that whether we like it or not, our continuing under a Proprietary Government will not prevent it, nor our coming under a Royal Government promote and forward it, any more than they would prevent or procure Rain or Sunshine, &c. &c.”6—To the last Paragraph in the 20th Page, which, as a Part of it, is so exceedingly applicable to the Doctor’s, and his Colleague’s late Conduct, as well as our Feelings. I presume you will [349]have no Objection to hearing him conclude, as follows—“On the Whole, I cannot but think, the more the Proposal is considered, of ⟨an humble Petition to the⟩ King, ⟨to take this Province under his immediate Protection and Government,⟩ the more unanimously we shall go into it. We are chiefly People of ⟨three Countries:⟩ British Spirits can no longer bear the Treatment they have received, nor will they put on Chains prepared for them by a fellow Subject. And the Irish and Germans have felt too severely the Oppressions of ⟨hard-hearted Landlords⟩ and ⟨arbitrary Princes,⟩ to wish to see, in the proprietaries of Pennsylvania, both united, &c.”7—Had he said,—“Nor will they put on Chains prepared for them by fellow Citizens,” it might, perhaps, have been considered as prophetic of the present Era.—Of this intended Change of Government, in Pennsylvania, Mr. Dickenson, in a Publication, speaks as follows,—“Benjamin Franklin, Esq. was accordingly chosen Speaker, and in the Afternoon of the same Day, signed the Petition, as one of his first Acts; an Act which——but Posterity will best be able to give it a Name!”8—If Mr. Dickenson’s Opinion, of the Doctor’s Conduct, was then just, which I believe all honest, unprejudiced Men thought it was, must not the Language we now speak, become much more copious and expressive than it is, to enable Posterity to give a proper Name to their late joint Act, the new Constitution, as it is called? I have been the more particular on these Gentlemen’s Conduct, as I perceive that much Stress is laid, by some Writers, on their Patriotism &c. especially the Doctor’s; and many at this time in your City, either from a State of Minority, or their former Residence, cannot be acquainted with all the Facts and Circumstances which I have produced. That Dr. Franklin countenanced and encouraged the Stamp Act. I have had sufficient Proof from several of his most intimate Friends; from his Conduct in favoring unasked, as they said, several of those Friends Appointments for carrying that Act into Execution,9 and, lastly, from several Letters to some of those very Persons who were appointed: I saw a Letter of the Doctor’s own Writing, in the Hands of his Attorney, in your City, wherein he was directed to acquaint the Printer of the New-York Journal, the late Mr. John Holt, of most respected memory, that, if he persisted in printing against the Ministry, he must not expect that his Papers would be permitted to circulate by the Post-riders; and this whilst the Doctor was in England, and the Execution of the Stamp Act was in Suspence. But Mr. Holt was neither to be cajoled nor intimidated; he wrote the Doctor, and told his Agent, that, if his Papers were refused the same Conveyance as the other Printers, he would appeal to the [350]Public, and hire a Rider, who should carry his Papers, as well as Letters, to his Customers. This, and the Opposition to the Stamp Act, had the desired Effect, an absolute Refusal was not made; but, Mr. Holt’s Papers were continually delayed, and not infrequently destroyed by the Doctor’s Deputies.10 But granting that the Doctor is really as great a Patriot as he has been represented, or, as ever existed, and that his Confederates were all as patriotic and wise as he, nay, supposing that they were all, in their private Capacities of Divine Descent, to what does it amount? As Members of the Convention, they were but Deputies of Deputies, not Representatives of the People. Whence then could they derive any Authority for offering a new and unheard of Constitution to the Inhabitants of the United States; when the Legislatures themselves, from whom the Convention derived its very existence, have not Power even to alter a single Sentence of the present Confederation; but only to confirm such Alterations as may be agreed to in a Congress of the United States? To save you the Trouble of looking for the Confederation, as it is now before me, I will transcribe the last Period of the 13th Article, which reads thus—“And the Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual: nor shall any Alteration at any Time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such Alterations be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State.”—Can any thing be more plain and comprehensive?—With what Consistency or Propriety can the Legislature of this, or any other State, consent to calling a Convention to consider of such a manifest insult offered by their Deputies to the Sovereignties of the States, as well as a most attrocious Attempt to dissolve the Union, when they were deputed solely for the Purpose of improving it, or rather perhaps for devising Means to improve it? If a Convention should be called, of which I confess, I cannot see either the Necessity, or even a Propriety, ought it not to be for impeaching the insidious Contrivers of such deep laid Designs, as appear from the Conduct of some of the late Convention, and the proffered Constitution? As a Grand-Juror, had the Convention sat in this State, I should have been for preferring a Bill against them, as Violators of the present Confederation, and Disturbers of the Public Tranquility. And, as it is, they appear to me, to be proper Objects of Impeachment in the respective States to which they belong; and that as well for a most unparalleled Breach of Trust and Usurpation, as for attempting to destroy the present Confederacy.—Should there, in Consequence of these Men’s Conduct, be any Secession or Separation of the States, though I cannot believe that even a Majority will adopt it, [351]as it is; must not they, the Contrivers, be considered as the Authors of all the Evil which may flow from a Dissolution of the Union? And yet, dreadful as the bare Apprehension of a Disunion may be, I do not really know, but it might be more eligible than the Adoption of what is offered us. For, though several very ingenious, sensible and patriotic Writers have undertaken to shew of what the different Parts of the new Constitution deprives us, not one, that I have seen, has attempted to shew in what it has fully and indefeasibly secured us, unless it be in building a Federal Town, with as many Seraglios as may be wanted, and supporting a standing army, to defend them against foreign Invasions, &c. Nor do I believe it in the Power of the Projectors and all their Adherents, to prove that we are sufficiently Secure in any one essential Right, either Civil or Religious, when such unlimited Powers are vested in a haughty Senate, and a hungry Monarchy, both of which may be continued as long as exorbitant Grants of Land, Contracts, Places, Pensions, and every Species of Bribery and Corruption, have an Influence. But more of this some other Time; I have not leisure, at present, to enlarge. I am, Dear Sir, Very respectfully, your’s &c.  COUNTRYMAN."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,,12/6/1787,"Sir, When I stated the monied difficulties, which the new government will have to encounter, my chief object was to prove to our fellow citizens, the delusion into which you have led them in your speech, when [368]you ventured “to predict that the great revenue of the United States, must, and always will be, raised by impost.” This is not the land, Sir, of second sight; and I have shewn that your prediction, is not founded on any knowledge of the subject. It is one of those numerous deceptions, that are practised upon the people to delude them into the toils that are spread for them by the proposed constitution. To satisfy them more fully on the subject of the revenue, that is to be raised upon them, in order to give enormous fortunes to the jobbers in public securities, I shall lay before them a proposition to Congress, from Mr. Robert Morris, when superintendant of finance. It is dated, I think,(a) the 29th of June, 1782, and is in these words:—“The requisition of a five per cent, impost, made on the 3d of February, 1781,2 has not yet been complied with by the state of Rhode-Island, but as there is reason to believe, that their compliance is not far off, this revenue may be considered as already granted.—It will, however, be very inadequate to the purposes intended. If goods be imported, and prizes introduced to the amount of twelve millions annually, the five per cent, would be six hundred thousand, from which at least one sixth must be deducted, as well for the cost of collection as for the various defalcations which will necessarily happen, and which it is unnecessary to enumerate. It is not safe therefore, to estimate this revenue at more than, half a million of dollars; for though it may produce more, yet probably it will not produce so much. It was in consequence of this, that on the 27th day of February last, I took the liberty to submit the propriety of asking the states for a land tax of one dollar for every hundred acres of land—a poll-tax of one dollar on all freemen, and all male slaves, between sixteen and sixty, excepting such as are in the federal army, or by wounds or otherwise rendered unfit for service; and an excise of one eighth of a dollar [per gallon], on all distilled spiritous liquors. Each of these may be estimated at half a million; and should the product be equal to the estimation, the sum total of revenues for funding the public debts, would be equal to two millions.”3 You will readily perceive, Mr. Wilson, that there is a vast difference between your prediction and your friends proposition. Give me leave to say, Sir, that it was not discreet, in you, to speak upon finance without instructions from this great financier. Since, independent of its delusive effect upon your audience, it may excite his jealousy, lest you should have a secret design of rivalling him in the expected office of superintendant under the new constitution. It is true, there is no real foundation for it; but then you know jealousy makes the food it feeds on. A quarrel between two such able and honest friends to the United States, would, I am persuaded, be felt as a public calamity. I beseech [369]you then to be very tender upon this point in your next harrangue. And if four months study will not furnish you with sufficient descretion, we will indulge you with six. It may be said, that let the government be what it may, the sums I have stated must be raised, and the same difficulties exist. This is not altogether true. For first, we are now in the way of paying the interest of the domestic debt, with paper, which under the new system is utterly reprobated. This makes a difference between the specie to be raised of 1,800,000 dollars per annum. If the new government raises this sum in specie on the people, it will certainly support public credit, but it will overwhelm the people. It will give immense fortunes to the speculators; but it will grind the poor to dust. Besides the present government is now redeeming the principal of the domestic debt by the sale of western lands. But let the full interest be paid in specie, and who will part with the principal for those lands. A principal, which having been generally purchased for two shillings and six pence on the pound, will yield to the holders two hundred and forty per cent. This paper system therefore, though in general an evil, is in this instance attended with the great benefit of enabling the public to cancel a debt upon easy terms, which has been swelled to its enormous size, by as enormous impositions. And the new government, by promising too much, will involve itself in a disreputable breech of faith, or in a difficulty of complying with it, insuperable. The present government promises nothing.—The intended government, every thing.—From the present government little is expected:—From the intended one, much. Because it is conceived that to the latter much is given—to the former, little. And yet the inability of the people to pay what is required in specie, remaining the same, the funds of the one will not much exceed those of the other. The public creditors are easy with the present government from a conviction of its inability—they will be urgent with the new one from an opinion, that as it promises, so it can and will perform every thing. Whether the change will be for our prosperity and honour, is yet to be tried. Perhaps it will be found, that the supposed want of power in Congress to levy taxes, is at present a veil happily thrown over the inability of the people; and that the large powers given to the new government, will to every eye, expose the nakedness of our land. Certain it is, that if the expectations which are grafted on the gift of these plenary powers, are not answered, our credit will be irretrievably ruined. Once more, Mr. Wilson, be pleased to pardon me for digressing. We come now to your last argument, or rather observation, which is in these terms—That as establishing the new government will—“turn the [370]stream of influence and emolument into a new channel, therefore every person who enjoys or expects to enjoy a place of profit under the present establishment, will object to the proposed innovation, not in truth, because it is injurious to the liberties of his country, but because it affects his schemes of wealth and consequence.” This reflection, sir, is as ingenious as it is liberal. It reaches every man who will not worship the new idol. It is the shibboleth of your party. Every man who differs in opinion with you, upon the new constitution, if he is not actually a placeman under the present establishment, may be an expectant; and then, according to your liberal and gentlemanly conclusion, his opinion must be imputed to his pursuit of wealth and consequence. But how could it escape you, that this was a two-edged argument, and might cut its inventor. Perhaps these very violent gentlemen for the new establishment, may be actuated by the same undue motives. Perhaps some of its framers, might have had its honours and emoluments in view. When you have let loose suspicion, Mr. Wilson, there is no knowing where it will end. Perhaps some may be audacious enough to suspect even—you. They may think, that the emoluments of an attorney generalship, or of a chief justice largely provided for, under a government gifted with almost chemic powers to extract gold from the people, might happily repair your shattered fortunes. Let us, Sir, suppose a man fallen from opulence into the most gloomy depths of monied distress, by an unsatiable love of wealth and as unwise a pursuit of it:4 would not such a man be a fit instrument in the hands of others to agitate the introduction of the new constitution. Such a man would have no objection to the golden speculations which such a constitution holds forth. Such a man, albeit unused to speak without a fee, and a large one too, would deign to harrangue gratis for such an object. His crest would be brightened, his eloquence animated by an anticipation of that happy hour, when he might sail down this new pactolean channel, accompanied by his pathetic Doctor,5 to sing a requiem to our expired liberties, and chant hallelujahs to his approach—to wealth and consequence. Such a man, Sir, in such a mood, would, as you do, regard the new constitution, in every point of view, with a candid and disinterested mind, and be bold to assert, “that it is the best form of government which has ever been offered to the world.” Such a man as I have painted, you know, Mr. Wilson, is not a fiction. What I have said was not to insult his distresses, but to admonish his discretion. He ought not to have touched ground, on which he, and his swelled superior,6 who dances him forth to the people, is so very vulnerable. Upon my honor, Sir, I do not know two men in the United [371]States more tender in this point. Permit me then to admonish them, through you, never again to insult the patience of the public with insinuations about the judgment of men on the proposed constitution, being affected by schemes of wealth and consequence. There is one very material power given to the proposed Congress, on which you have thought proper to be silent, and which as not coming within the scope of your speech I have reserved to this place. In the 4th section, it is said—“The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing senators.” In all our constitutions, the regulation of elections is fixed; not left to the legislature, because it is a fundamental right, in which the essence of liberty resides. It is in fact the root of all rights. Nothing can be plainer than that Congress, under the pretence of regulating, might in various ways annihilate the freedom of elections. If ever the aristocracy should meet with a pliant representative, it will be easy so to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections—as to secure the complaisance of future representatives. This power over elections is another proof of a prediction for the senate, and a determination to have a complete controul over the people. It participates precisely of the spirit, which dictated the rendering the power of impeachment nugatory, by the manner in which it is to be executed Thus too, the right of election, under controul from time to time, in point of manner, times, and places, is but a shadow in the people; while the substance will necessarily reside with those to whom the regulation of it is resigned. But the senate was too sacred to be subjected to this unhallowed touch. The aristocracy is elevated on high, while the democracy is trampled in the dust. If the people can indeed be deluded into such a surrender of their most sacred rights; it must arise from the precipitation with which they are called upon to decide. Still, however, I trust, that they will have discernment to discover the parts which are incompatible with their rights and liberties, and spirit to insist upon those parts being amended. (a) I say, I think, because, by accident, the month is erased in the note I have, and I have not access to public papers which would enable me to supply the defect."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (II),,New York Journal,,12/6/1787,"Worthy and esteemed Sir, I received your letter of the 21st of last month with the new constitution and several pieces for and against it, which you were kind enough to send me, and for which I return you my hearty thanks. You condescend to ask my opinion of it, which, I [373]fear, will scarcely be worth the trouble it will give you in reading. All I know about politics. I learnt during the late troubles, and that chiefly by reading the votes of our assembly and the journal of Congress, which you were good enough, now and then, to lend me. In the fore part of the war. I had a very good opinion of our Congress and principal men, that were employed in public business—they appeared to me very honest and very much in earnest to forward the common cause, but I will honestly confess to you, that towards the last, when the danger seemed to be in a great measure over, and when they began to appoint ministers of finance, and ministers of one thing and ministers of another, I did not think so well of them. Near the end of the war, I sold a pair of as good fat cattle as any in the parts, to one of our commissaries, for thirty-pounds, which was cheap, and not more than they would have sold for before the war—he, indeed, appeared very generous, and did not seem to wish to bait me of the price—our bargain was for hard money, then pretty currently going in the country—but, instead of this, he gave me paper, that he called Morris’s Notes,1 which, he said, was every bit as good, and I took them at his word; but, he was hardly gone from my house, before another man came, who said, he was immediately from Philadelphia, and told me a quite different story, and said, that they were much depreciated, and this made me very uneasy, you may be sure, as I did not like to throw away my cattle for nothing—however, he offered to take them from me, if I would make him an allowance, so I let him have them for five and twenty pounds, which, if I remember rightly, he called the discount—now, I thought this very strange, but my neighbour ——’s son, who, you know, was a serjeant in the standing forces, came home to see his parents a few days after, and he told me, there was nothing more common, for, whenever the soldiers got any pay it was in that way, and that they were often obliged to sell, at the rate of ten shillings for the pound, and that they must either do it or starve, for they could not do without some money; but, that I was very wrong, for I could have laid out of my money a little while, and sent the notes to Philadelphia and got the cash, for that some of these notes issued, but when there was money at command to pay them off.—I told him, I thought this was very strange, since at that rate, they might send the money at once, as well as the notes—he said, I knew nothing of the matter, for, that there was a number of people always following the commissaries, quarter-masters, and pay masters, who bought these notes up in the manner they did from me, and who were concerned with great men, among them they made a great deal of money by it—whereas, if the money was sent at once, they would not have an opportunity of filling their pockets. Now, as I said before, [374]I confess to you, worthy sir, this gave me a bad opinion of some of our great men; but to return to the new constitution, I really have not had much time to read it, or the papers about it, being much behind hand in my business this year, owing to one disappointment or another—I remember well that our first or second Congress, I do not know which, and I believe they were both made up of as wise and as good men as any ever we have had since, wrote letters to the people of England and Ireland, and to our neighbours in Canada, endeavouring to convince them, that we were right to oppose the late government, which they clearly proved was unjustly oppressing and injuring us. In their letter to the people of Canada, they complained grievously of the conduct of the rulers of our former government, and told them, that a certain Mr. Beccaria (who I suppose must have been a countryman of theirs, and, of course, more likely to be believed by them) says, “that there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the heighth of power and happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery;”2 I believe these are the very words. Now, I am really very much afraid, that this is the case with the new constitution men, for it appears to me, that this president-general will have a great deal of power, and I think the chance is as ten to one when he gets a standing army, and has the command of all the militia, that he may not make the best use of them, and I should not wonder at all (unless he should happen to be a very good tempered man) that the backs of some, of our militia men, would pay for it, as the tories did during the war—besides the senate seem to have a vast deal of power too, and from the manner they are appointed and continued in their places, I dont see how we are to set about to turn them out if they behave badly; indeed, good sir, the president looks to me very much like a king, and the senate like a house of lords, and, I suppose, the supreme judiciaries that are spoke of, will be like the lord justices of the assizes, or the twelve great judges in the old countries, where, they tell me, a man need to have a deep pocket if he goes to law, and that a poor man stands but very little chance, at any rate, to get justice done him, especially if he has to contend with a rich one—besides, it seems to me, that the president and senate will have a great deal of business to do together, and it is so jumbled and contrived, that if they do wrong, we can hardly find out who to lay the blame to—and, I think it wont be a hard matter, as they have a great many good things to give, to get the assembly-men too on their side of the question, and I believe, we may pretty certainly expect, that if they once get fairly a going they will do as this Mr. Beccaria says, keep down the common people and encrease their own power, especially, as I see they are to have a common [375]treasury, out of which they can pay themselves what they please, without asking any body, and I suppose they will make us sweat in taxes to keep it full. There is another thing, our Congress told the people of Canada, in their letter, and I believe they were in earnest. “That the trial by jury, was one of the best securities in the world, for the life, liberty and property of the people.”3—Now to be sure, I am very much of their opinion in this; for I would rather trust my life, liberty and property to a verdict of twelve of my honest neighbours, than to the opinion of any great man in the world, for great men are not always honest men, and they may be too proud, and not care to give themselves the trouble to enquire very narrowly into common people’s disputes; and if an honest farmer should happen to say any thing against a great man, tho’ it was ever so true, it would be in the power of the Judge to punish him for it very severely—and I don’t doubt, but what he would do it; but I am sure a good honest jury of his neighbours would never punish him for speaking the truth: I know it is said that truth is not to be spoken at all times, but the best of us may be guilty of little acts of imprudence, for which however, we should not be too severely handled: I find the writers disagree about this matter; the one says this right of trial by jury is taken away by the new constitution, and the other says it is not.—Now, as they differ, I have been trying to find out the truth myself, and, it appears to me middling clear, that if it is not absolutely taken away; yet that this new General Congress, that we read of, may take it away whenever they please—now, if it is so good a thing that it never ought to be taken away, I think we ought not to give them power to do it; for I can’t see the reason of giving them power, which they never can make use of, without doing us a great deal of hurt: Now all parties may mean what is honest at present, but notwithstanding, there may be a time, when we have bad men to rule us, and I think it would be imprudent to give power, which every one allows there is no necessity for, and with which bad men, if so disposed, might do us a great deal of harm, and I am more confirmed in this belief, when I think of what the said Mr. Beccaria says about this desire, which has always prevailed in men of increasing their power. This is all I can say about the matter at present, having, as I mentioned before, little time to attend to it; but, as my neighbour —— ——, whom you know to be a sensible thinking man, and has more learning than I have, has agreed with me to spend some time together to read it more carefully over, now that the evenings are growing long, and the hurry of business is pretty near past, I will write to you again on the subject, if my letters do not prove troublesome. [376 Before I finish, I will relate to you, however, what has happened in our neighbourhood, since you were here, for although it is an affair of little consequence, it seems to me to be something like this new-government business; you know that we belonged to the —— congregation, and the church was at a great distance from us, and it was often very inconvenient to us, for many who had not horses for all our families to ride to church, were obliged, when it was bad walking, to stay at home, and in truth, we did not like the minister; this made us think of forming ourselves into a separate congregation, which, after taking the proper steps, we did; and we set about a subscription, and raised a little money, and built ourselves a small snug house to worship in, and called a very good kind of a man for a minister, who preached to us for a very moderate stipend, which we made out to pay him pretty punctually, considering the hardness of the times; and we were all very happy and contented, and religion seemed to flourish amongst us, until lately, that some of our young men, who were in the wars, returned home; some of these set about studying, and very soon became lawyers; others got a little goods, and became shop-keepers; and others done no business at all, but lived like gentlemen, expecting to get a living by public employments, as they called it: These young men began to find fault with every thing we did; they said, we were unacquainted with the world, and could not judge properly how matters should be conducted; they said our church was too small, too plain, and not well finished; and, upon this account, that we were despised by all the neighbouring congregations, who had larger and finer churches; and, it is strange to tell, but so it is, by these means they soon worked upon the vanity of some of our more elderly and serious people, and though they could not get them to consent to build a new church, they agreed to enlarge and repair the old one, and make it much more shewy. The next thing they did, was to get themselves with two or three of the elderly men (who were honest men and pretty wise about other matters, but knew little about repairing churches) appointed trustees to manage the business; which being done, they set about and collected a quantity of great heavy strong timber and other materials, and up they set a spacious large new house, as fine as you please, leaving the old one (though a good deal weakened by taking out some of the under-pinning) standing, in the mean time to worship in, ’till the new one can be finished;—but now our difficulties began, the more sober part of the congregation found that this new building was a very expensive one, and was likely to create great divisions in the congregation, many of them liking the old one better than the new one, and thinking that it might have been repaired, so as better to answer all our purposes: these began to say, that they would pay nothing towards it, and [377]have nothing to do with it: and, what greatly added to their dissatisfaction, was, that they found that it was not to end here, for from some hints that were thrown out by those young men, and plans (as they are called) of the building, it was found, that this new building was so contrived, that it was to have a large steeple and galleries added to it, and large high pews in it for the better sort of people to sit in, so that they might not be troubled with the common people, or rabble as they fained to call them; and some even went so far as to say that upon raising the covering of that end of the church, where steeples are usually placed, and peeping in, that they had discovered the mortices and other things, which could only be contrived for adding a steeple to it in good earnest; this as you may judge, increased the discontent, until at length more than one half of the congregation refused to have any thing to do with it; the trustees finding this, brought suits against them to make them pay, what they said they had promised, and as they were chiefly lawyers, they had the advantage, for if judgment was given against them, they certiorared the justices, and put them to such costs and trouble in attending the courts at a great distance, that they are almost fairly tired and worried out; our poor minister too was led astray by these young men; they made him believe that his salary ought to be raised, and by following their advice in trying to get more, he, at last, could get nothing at all, and was obliged to leave us: now in this our disagreeable situation, many of our most zealous and best-disposed people talk of breaking off entirely and joining the old congregation, seeing they cannot worship here peaceably without quarrelling, and too heavy expence for them to support, so that we are brought into a very sad pickle, by following the advice of these young men, and I do not know what will become of us. I heartily wish you could be among us a few days, in hopes, by your good advice, that we might get reconciled and to rights again; for we all place great confidence in you, and your opinion would have great weight among us: indeed, as I said before, I do not know what will become of us, if with our present difficulties and troubles, we should be saddled with more, by the new constitution. I remain, honored sir, Your real friend, and Humble servant, A COUNTRYMAN."
Newspaper,No,Roderick Razor,,New York Daily Advertiser,,12/11/1787,"Mr. PRINTER, I am a worthy and deserving citizen, which has supported or underwent as you may say, several important and fruitless State offices; but being now out of place, I would be willing to undergo, or be located to some snug birth in one of the street Sovereignties, which is like to be soon erected and accommodated in and about this city, as I am informed. I beg therefore humbly to put myself up (as we do some times for Semblymen) for Norotor General, to any pretty large and populatious street that is going. Thank Heaven I have good lungs, and I have kept company so long, with our most learned and most virtuous, and most wisest men; that I can say off about standing armies, and juries without trial, and the extinguishing the liberty of speaking and printing, and excise, and all them things, as well as my betters; whose betters I expect one of these days to be. Turn and turn about, Mr. Printer, is fair play. In all well manufactured free Governments, there is a lively and pleasant kind of a circum rotation as it were, like unto the whirling of a squirrel’s cage; the top goes quick to the bottom, and the bottom to the top; which is a much seemlier and juster comparison, than that of the boiling of a pot and the scum’s rising up, which is only a kind of a jumblification; whereas your circum rotation is a much pleasanter motion, and gives a chance to all to come in for a cut of what is going; bottoms, tops and middles. Some say there a’nt to be such a place as what I am asking for; that is all a hum; and they are only bamboozling us; but I know better. Mr. Latner is one of our family, and he is certainly [383]of our side; for he has got our watch word or counter-sign, which is Stocracy; and there is Montesque2 in another mightily used by us. I asked Squire Sour Crout (who was one of our head men) what this same Stocracy was? And he told me “it meant the same as tho’ you should say, such a one is not of our side. He said it was a marvellously useful word; he took the first notion of it from Domine3 Van Wrangletext, who calls all that come to hear him, and that are willing to contribute to the support of the gospel, Our-to-dox, or our side; and those that go to hear other Domines, and squander their money upon them, he calls Etterodox, or otherwise; which means t’other side. When Domine Van Wrangletext find his parish following after strange Domines, and wasting their substance, he cries lustily. Etterodox! Etterodox! the Etterodox will all be damned! eternally damned! The Church is in danger! and maybe sometimes he will throw The State too into the bargain to make an alarm, and scare away them who would overthrow the Christian religion.” Sometimes it is good policy to bring in politics with religion; and sometimes religion into politics. Now there is your Centry,4 the great Philadelphia writer in our cause; he has found out more than our ninny’s here. They have made a noise about there being no security in the new fangled Government, for the liberty of the press; but he has found out, that the liberty of religion is in danger; which is a most excellent discovery, because it will larum5 and terrify a great many who know nothing about politics, and strengthen the true cause. Squire Sour Crout says, “that there is a deep laid scheme to establish unfidelity, which is the wickedest of all religions, because it has no religion at all in it. He says there is to be no tests under the new Government. No man is to be obliged to say his prayers, or his creed, and tell whether he believes in the Devil, or the doctrine of chance. This is the work of the haughty Southern Nabobs, who have no religion, and want to spend all the public money on Barbers to powder their hair, and for silk stockings and fineries. Says he yarn ones are good enough for me or any body. They are warm in winter, and in summer they soak up the sweat, at which I suppose your Southern Dilly Daiseys would be ready to faint, and say it should be called upsorping the pusfiration, but I am for the plain humspun neighbor Razor. I hope to see the day when trade will be at an end, and there will be no foreign luxuries imported but striped blankets—when ancient simple manners will prevail, and he that can’t make his own moccasons may go barefoot, and he that wont build his own wigwam, why let him set out of doors.” These Nabobs are so monstrous proud, because they command a heap of negroes. That is one thing makes them so much for Slavery and Stocracy. Now if you can find in Duchess and Albany counties, any [384]of our friends and the opposers of the new tyranny, who have half a dozen big negro slaves, I will believe that his Honor Squire Clip Purse Van Clink de Gelt6 loves money, and made a snatch at the Congress Treasury. He has been very ill used, good and worthy man! He stood stout against voting away the public money, for a heap of useless offices in the new Hio lands.7 He buffed or bucked at the katteract of corruption as long as he could, for there was no Loan-offices made for honest men to encourage them; but at last, some how or other his strength failed him. “This worthy Patriot was not, neighbour Razor (says the Squire) pleasantly paddling his canoe between the Over-Slaugh and Albany, against the freshes of the Hudson, in the delightsome sport of taking its favorite fish the Sturgeon: but it was the mighty Southern torrent of luxury and boundless profusion; deep, wide and rapid as the Ohio, whose lofty and tossing billows he buffeted, until he became faint and weary, and drowsiness began to steal upon him.” I says to the Squire not to interrupt you, I suppose sir, that he leaned poor man a little upon one side; and so did the canoe; and then he nodded, and so off went his hat, and that fine new wig. For the Albany canoes are many of them very narrow and tottlish. “I wish that had been all my friend, but to proceed says the Squire, the paddle with which he has so long and dextrously steered both his canoe, and our state, dropped out of his hands; and souze went he into the mighty waters, which to him will be ever waters of bitterness and affliction. A huge wave struck him on the head, stunned him, and canted him round; and he drove senseless down the stream only a little way, and the Southern Lords, what should they do out of spite, but whip abroad, and call every body to see the poor old gentlemen catched as it were —— but I shall not use the expressions unlucky boys are wont to do when they suddenly surprize some profound Philosopher or great Statesman, like our patriot in his most retired place of meditation; suffice it to say he was shamefully exposed in an unlucky moment; and in a posture not only unseemly, but comical, and most melancholy withal. “The moment he waked, he cut and run for it; and while he stays at home drying himself, I hope he won’t be idle; but will stir his stumps against our enemies and their schemes; and that no infernal plots will be hatched by those he has run from, while this our honest and sharp sighted State pilot and watchman, is absent: and that we shall shortly see him here again, with a new paddle, and a better pair of spectacles.” Ah, Mr. Printer, it is melancholy, very melancholy indeed! when the righteous stumbleth, the wicked always rejoice and laughs them to scorn. We think it is the work of some of the party of that little D—I who deserves to be hanged for signing, and that alone too, the dead warrant of our [385]State Sovereignty.8 We shall never do cleverly while he lives. I wish he was put out of the way. It would be as good a deed as to drink, to do it. I am sure I should not stick at either a rope or a razor, if I had a chance. He tossicated the heads of our staunchest men last winter, and staggered them so confoundedly, he almost made them believe, there was one honest man of that side, that did not mean to ruin the State. Ifackins if our side had not cunningly taken to the bush, where his business wont so well let him follow us, it might have gone hard with us. He may be as knowing as a sarpent, but I’ll be hanged if he is as harmless as a sucking dove, for he stings most consumedly. If he should find out the right way to get in (and we know how the trick is done) and set his cap that way. Egad I am afraid we should all be in the suds; the Philistines would be upon us. Squire Sour Crout says, “it was meant at first to have tried and hanged him for high treason against the State and all the rest who spoke or wrote for overturning the State Constitution. For tho’ it gives liberty of speech and the press, yet it is meant he says only on such matters, and at such times, as the best men in the State think proper and for the good of the State: and if we could have been sure of a pretty large majority, we should have tucked up all who were enemies to its Sovereignty; and might have done it under the Constitution, just as handily as we voted out the general impost by it. But as matters now look, the Squire says he is sorry the cat was unluckily let out of the bag—that it was unwarily mentioned by some of our side, that signing the Convention was treason against the State; because our adversaries may take handle against us, and say mere declarations are not a full security; for a prevailing State or national faction, having both inclination and power, will not suffer words (which they can construe as they like) to defend those they have marked out as victims. “A Bill or Rights or Constitution, in suitable hands and properly managed, is a very useful and pliable convenience, said he. That of Pennsylvania, when in the hands of the true friends to equal liberty was most excellent; but now it has got into other hands, it is abominable. That a majority of bad men should govern, is contrary to all sound republican doctrine; which teaches that when an impious majority bear sway, the virtuous minority, when they cannot seize the reins of Government into their own hands, should like Sampson pull down its pillars, and bury themselves and their enemies under its ruins; as was bravely attempted by the Sixteen true and virtuous Republicans in Pennsylvania:9 and it would have been done too, had it not been for the villainous Philadelphia populace. If,” says the Squire, “the new scheme goes down, it will be the confoundedest bite that ever happened; he and the rest of our side laughed, he says, heartily, at the notion of a number of grave [386]noddles getting together to alter and mend the old thing. Let them have turned it, or altered the cape, or the cuffs, or have cut the skirts shorter, it would make it no better; and if they had put two or three good new strong patches into it, the stitches would not hold in the old cloth, but it would tear the more and the faster for the new pieces; but as to making an entire new coat, they never dreamt the plaguy fellows would attempt it. Zounds! if the people wear it now it is made, neighbour Razor,” says he, “it will be the most infernal take-in that ever we were bamboozled with.” A fig, and a fiddle-stick’s end, Mr. Printer, for your fidderal or fodderal nonsensikalities. “Every tub stand on its own bottom;10 every dog shake his own paw; the hardest send off; let him laugh that wins;11 and the like, his honor Squire Clip Purse Van Clink de Gelt says, “these is the maxums and axums of true state policy.” A good night’s rest to his pious soul, whenever we must lose him. A customer of mine, a young Lawyer, who writes politics, and makes poetry too, says, “He is sure the Angel in Heaven that keeps the Records, or is Clerk of the Court of Oyer and Terminer there, will drop a tear on the word Felony, in the indictment which the Treasury Board Nabobs have sent up against him, and blot it out for ever. So that it will be squashed, and he never be called upon to plead to this one, if he can but keep his fingers still, and will go and do so no more.” Mr. Printer, I speak it with reverence and submission, I humbly conceive I can smell a rat as quick, and see as far into a mill-stone as some others. I do now smell a plot; nay, I smell two plots. The southern bashaws are for establishing unfidelity; the eastern saints, double stilled high wine piritanism. Every body knows they once punished a sea-captain just come home, for kissing his wife on a sabbaday, as he met her in the street. Now the squire, who is “as deep as Chelsea,” as the saying is, “says that all men love power; that the supreme Fedderal court may go from one step to another, until they get to try justice cases; and may in time set here in the room of our magistrates, and send any one they call antifederal to bridewell.12 In like manner the saints will proceed, as you may say, progressively; and tho’ from the time, place, and other circumstances, the squire says it is presumed the kissing aforesaid was not more, or other, than simple osculation, or lip salutation upon the sabbath; yet it may in process of time be artfully extended to kissing in every manner and form, and of every kind, degree, grade, and species; upon any day, or hour of the day in the whole week; nay, even to the night, and not only to the night, but to every hour in the night: And what then, says he, neighbour Razor, in the name of procreation! is to [387]become of the human specie? The world will be at an end! it will become destinct!” I do declare and affirm, and avow, that it is a crying sin, that there is no Bill of Rights to the new Scheme—I have heard that there was once a bloody war between the big Endians and little Endians, because their Bill of Rights did not say they might break their eggs at which end they pleased. I have heard it said, and that too by credulous men, that by a jury of Cockneys, a sort of people that live in Lunnon,13 a man would be hanged, that boiled a leg of mutton without turnips: but there is no security in the new Constitution, that in their own free country a Lunnoner may either eat potatoes or carrots with his mutton if he chuses, or let them alone. Another monstrous danger has been mentioned by some interested friends, who are not one bit affected by the trade or malufacture. I shall briefly discourse of some who are aboveboard, and doing very well for themselves. Thank Heaven, they have good snug births for themselves; I say, for they have been unfortunately separated from their wives and children, ever since they were born. Every one must allow, that the trade of Dungarvan,14 which is the malufactory of feet for children’s stockings, of all trades ought certainly to be free. No imposts, duty, or excise on it; vet they shake their heads, and have great jealously on this business: “First, says they, neighbour Razor, perhaps comes a small duty on stockings; then if the people will bear it, a stout import on legs; and last of all brings up the rear, a swinging excise, or impost or some accursed prohibition, on the malufactures themselves. They have declared they will oppose every infringement on this business, tho’ they never have followed it; nor ever expect to follow it;” which I think is very generous in them indeed. Should a standing army be raised in time of peace, and under pretence of guarding the frontiers, be marched to stop this trade; I’ll be hanged if your old continentals would not quit the ranks the minute they smoaked the business; and if we wanted help (which I don’t think we should) why I dare say the volunteers of Ireland, who took up arms, they say, for liberty and a fair and free trade,15 would come over to help us, and their countrymen here would, every man and mother’s son, join them; so that the new Constitution won’t be able to take away our dearest rights and privileges. Let them set it to work then if they will, Mr. Printer, as Kecksey says in the Play, “who’s afraid?”16 and so Mr Printer, I am your humble sarvant, RODERICK RAZOR."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (II),,New York Journal,,12/13/1787,"Honored and good Sir, Your kind letter of the 10th of this month gave me great relief, for I was sore afraid that my very long epistle to you, had wearied and offended you, which I am very glad to find is not the case, as you ask me to write to you again, which I shant fail doing: my neighbour ——, and myself, as I mentioned to you in my last2 we intended, have since spent several evenings together, and sat up late, reading the new constitution, and papers, in hopes to come to a thorough knowledge of them, which to be sure, is not an easy matter; one thing, and it would appear but a trifling matter, puzzled us exceedingly, that is, the names the different writers have fixed upon one another; for we found that those who are for abiding by the confederation and strengthening it, so as to make it lasting, are called antifederalists; and the other party who are for throwing it aside, and having nothing farther to do with it, but are for making of us into one solid government, are called federalists: now I did not know the meaning of the high-flown words, but my neighbour told me, that antifederalists were people, that were against the confederation; and that federalists were those that were for it: now, as I said before, this puzzled us very much, and often prevented our understanding what we were reading—at length we both agreed, that either the writers themselves or the printers had made a mistake; so to hinder our being bothered any more, it was agreed, that my neighbour should take pen and ink, and strike out anti, where it was used, and put it to the other word, so as to make it read right all through, and this, I can assure you, was a great help to us, and well paid for the time it took, for we could understand what we read with much greater ease afterwards. The day after, our old neighbour ——, who, you heard me tell, had just before the war, moved down to Pennsylvania, and had come up to see his friends here, and spent the next evening with us, and we mentioned the matter to him, and he told us there was nothing at all strange in it, for it was the way some great men had to deceive the common people, and prevent their knowing what they were about; he said it was just so down with them, for there was a party of grand men in Philadelphia, who had made a great deal of money during the war, and lived like princes, had been trying all their might to overset their constitution this several years, and he did not doubt, but they wished to have a king, that they might be lords, or something else still greater themselves and make more money [407]again, yet they called themselves republicans, because they knew it was a name that is very pleasing to the people, when, in truth, they are no more republicans than the pope, or the pretender himself; this you may judge, worthy sir, cleared up the matter to us at once; however we did not repent that we made the alterations, for they will be useful to our neighbours, when we lend the papers to them to read. But to go on, after we thought we understood the new constitution, nearly as well as it can be understood, I thought to myself, I would shew my neighbour the last letter I wrote to you, for I kept a copy of it, which I did, and he read it over and over again, and it pleased me a good deal, to find, that he thinks, what I said there, was very right; but he said at the same time, that though my letter was very long, I had not been quite plain enough about one thing, for, he said, we should be careful not to give a bit more power to our rulers than we could well help; for they would always find a way to get more fast enough, and they knew how to keep it when they once had it, so that we could never get any part of it back again; and to prove what he said, he put me in mind, that the convention was only sent to amend the old constitution, yet they sat about making a new one, though they had no power to do that at all; besides he made some other remarks which I will now mention to you, for we think very much alike about the business; he agrees with me, that very little dependence can be put on the president-general, and the senate, that they are to be appointed in a very odd manner, and would be so far above the common people, that they will care little about them, and when they get themselves fairly fixed in the saddle, there will be no such thing as to get them out again; but he seems to think, that the assemblymen, if there was enough of them, and if we could be sure that they would be honest and faithful, might give the others a deal of trouble, and hinder them from doing much mischief for a good while; but there are so very few of them, and the chance of getting good ones so little, from the manner which may be contrived by this new government, for making choice of them, that we cannot have much dependence from this quarter. We do not see but that they may order the election to be held in New-York city; I am sure, if they do, there is not one in a hundred of us country people, will be at the expence and trouble of attending there, to give our votes, except it should happen in the fall, just when we take our truck to market, and then a few of us might by chance, if we could get time [to] give a vote, so that your mayor, and other great folks, may put in who they please, and, I believe, there is little doubt, but they will put in such folks as Mr. Beccaria speaks of,3 that will love to increase their own power, and keep down the common people; besides, if the election should be ordered [408]to be held at any other place, lords of manors, and other great folks will attend, and be able to divide these places among themselves, in spite of all the common people can do; indeed, my neighbour tells me, he has often heard some of these great people say (for you know many of them think a good deal of him, and tell their minds very freely to him) that we were very wrong to send to our present congress, some people that we sent there, that although they were honest, and men of good enough sense, yet they could do us little or no good there, for they were unacquainted with the world; and that no man could be of service, if he was not very rich, and had large family connections, and knew how to dance, and dress well. Now, I suppose it will be the same case in this new government; and if so, I am sure, we would lean upon a broken reed, if we rely upon the assemblymen a bit more than upon the others. There is another thing, in this new constitution, that my neighbour and me, have talked a good deal about; it is what is called in the writings you sent me, article 9th, section 1st [i.e., Article I, section 9]. Indeed, we hardly know what they will be at by this; for fear you should mistake me, I believe I had better write it down; they say, “the migration, or importation of such persons, as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the congress, prior to the year 1808, but a tax, or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.” Now we think it very hard, if that is their meaning, that they should make every man, that comes from the old countries here, pay ten dollars to the new government. A great many of us, have our relations in the North of Ireland, and other places, that were very good friends to us all the war, and gave a great deal of trouble to the British, and I believe, partly upon our accounts, who might wish to come and settle here, among us; and I am sure they would be of great service to us, but do not you think it would be a hard matter for them to pay for their passages, besides their other expences, ten hard dollars for themselves, and each person in their families, when they get to this country. But our old neighbour from Pennsylvania, says, that it is thought among them, to mean worse than this, that its true meaning, is to give leave to import negroes from Guinea, for slaves, to work upon the rich men’s plantations, to the southward; but that it is not mentioned plainly on purpose, because the quakers, and a great many other good religious people, are very much against making slaves of our fellow-creatures, and especially, against suffering any more to be brought into the country, and this, if it was known, might make them all against the new government: [409]now, if this is really the case, it is to be sure, much worse than my neighbour and me first thought it to be; for all good christians must agree, that this trade is an abomination to the Lord, and must, if continued, bring down a heavy judgment upon our land. It does not seem to be justice, that one man should take another from his own country, and make a slave of him; and yet we are told by this new constitution, that one of its great ends, is to establish justice; alas! my worthy friend, it is a serious thing to trifle with the great God; his punishments are slow, but always sure; and the cunning of men, however deep, cannot escape them. I well remember, that our congress (and I believe, as I mentioned before, that they were honest, good men who meant as they said) when they declared independence, solemnly said, that “all men were created equal; and that they were endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; and that among them, are these, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” They also talked much about the sacredness of a trial by jury;4 and complained loudly, that the old government tried to hinder the peopleing of this country, by discourageing people to come here from the old countries;5 and for these, and other causes, they went to war, after making a solemn appeal to God, for the rectitude of their intentions; and even the infidel must confess, that God was remarkably with us, watched over us in the hour of danger, fought our battles, and subdued our enemies, and finally gave us success. Alas! my good friend, it is a terrible thing to mock the almighty, for how can we expect to merit his favor, or escape his vengeance; if it should appear, that we were not serious in our professions, and that they were mere devices to gratify our pride and ambition, we ought to remember, he sees into the secret recesses of our hearts, and knows what is passing there. It becomes us then to bear testimony against every thing which may be displeasing in his sight, and be careful that we incur not the charge mentioned by the prophet Hosea, “ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies, because thou didst trust in thy ways, in the multitude of thy mighty men.”6 Here I shall finish this present letter; and when I find a little more leisure, I will continue to write to you again. I remain, Honoured Sir, Your real friend, And humble servant. A COUNTRYMAN."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,12/13/1787,"To the People of the State of New-York. It was intended in this Number to have prosecuted the enquiry into the organization of this new system; particularly to have considered the dangerous and premature union of the President and Senate, and the mixture of legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the Senate. But there is such an intimate connection between the several branches in whom the different species of authority is lodged, and the powers with which they are invested, that on reflection it seems necessary first to proceed to examine the nature and extent of the powers granted to the legislature. This enquiry will assist us the better to determine, whether the legislature is so constituted, as to provide proper checks and restrictions for the security of our rights, and to guard against the abuse of power—For the means should be suited to the end; a government should be framed with a view to the objects to which it extends: if these be few in number, and of such a nature as to give but small occasion or opportunity to work oppression in the exercise of authority, there will be less need of a numerous representation, and special guards against abuse, than if the powers of the government are very extensive, and include a great variety of cases. It will also be found necessary to examine the extent of these powers, in order to form a just opinion how far this system can be considered as a confederation, or a consolidation of the states. Many of the advocates for, and most of the opponents to this system, agree that the form of government most suitable for the United States, is that of a confederation. The idea of a confederated government is that of a number of independent states entering into a compact, for the conducting certain general concerns, in which they have a common interest, leaving the management of their internal and [411]local affairs to their separate governments. But whether the system proposed is of this nature cannot be determined without a strict enquiry into the powers proposed to be granted. This constitution considers the people of the several states as one body corporate, and is intended as an original compact, it will therefore dissolve all contracts which may be inconsistent with it. This not only results from its nature, but is expressly declared in the 6th article of it.2 The design of the constitution is expressed in the preamble, to be, “in order to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity.” These are the ends this government is to accomplish, and for which it is invested with certain powers, among these is the power “to make all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.” It is a rule in construing a law to consider the objects the legislature had in view in passing it, and to give it such an explanation as to promote their intention. The same rule will apply in explaining a constitution. The great objects then are declared in this preamble in general and indefinite terms to be to provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and an express power being vested in the legislature to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all the powers vested in the general government. The inference is natural that the legislature will have an authority to make all laws which they shall judge necessary for the common safety, and to promote the general welfare. This amounts to a power to make laws at discretion: No terms can be found more indefinite than these, and it is obvious, that the legislature alone must judge what laws are proper and necessary for the purpose. It may be said, that this way of explaining the constitution, is torturing and making it speak what it never intended. This is far from my intention, and I shall not even insist upon this implied power, but join issue with those who say we are to collect the idea of the powers given from the express words of the clauses granting them; and it will not be difficult to shew that the same authority is expressly given which is supposed to be implied in the forgoing paragraphs. In the 1st article, 8th section, it is declared, “that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States.” In the preamble, the intent of the constitution, [412]among other things, is declared to be to provide for the common defence, and promote the general welfare, and in this clause the power is in express words given to Congress “to provide for the common defence, and general welfare.”—And in the last paragraph of the same section there is an express authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution this power. It is therefore evident, that the legislature under this constitution may pass any law which they may think proper. It is true the 9th section restrains their power with respect to certain objects. But these restrictions are very limited, some of them improper, some unimportant, and others not easily understood, as I shall hereafter shew. It has been urged that the meaning I give to this part of the constitution is not the true one, that the intent of it is to confer on the legislature the power to lay and collect taxes, &c. in order to provide for the common defence and general welfare. To this I would reply, that the meaning and intent of the constitution is to be collected from the words of it, and I submit to the public, whether the construction I have given it is not the most natural and easy. But admitting the contrary opinion to prevail, I shall nevertheless, be able to shew, that the same powers are substantially vested in the general government, by several other articles in the constitution. It invests the legislature with authority to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, in order to provide for the common defence, and promote the general welfare, and to pass all laws which may be necessary and proper for carrying this power into effect. To comprehend the extent of this authority, it will be requisite to examine 1st. what is included in this power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises. 2d. What is implied in the authority, to pass all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying this power into execution. 3d. What limitation, if any, is set to the exercise of this power by the constitution. 1st. To detail the particulars comprehended in the general terms, taxes, duties, imposts and excises, would require a volume, instead of a single piece in a news-paper. Indeed it would be a task far beyond my ability, and to which no one can be competent, unless possessed of a mind capable of comprehending every possible source of revenue; for they extend to every possible way of raising money, whether by direct or indirect taxation. Under this clause may be imposed a poll-tax, a land-tax, a tax on houses and buildings, on windows and fire places, on cattle and on all kinds of personal property:—It extends to duties on all kinds of goods to any amount, to tonnage and poundage on vessels, to duties on written instruments, news-papers, almanacks, [413]and books:—It comprehends an excise on all kinds of liquors, spirits, wines, cyder, beer, &c. and indeed takes in duty or excise on every necessary or conveniency of life; whether of foreign or home growth or manufactory. In short, we can have no conception of any way in which a government can raise money from the people, but what is included in one or other of these general terms. We may say then that this clause commits to the hands of the general legislature every conceivable source of revenue within the United States. Not only are these terms very comprehensive, and extend to a vast number of objects, but the power to lay and collect has great latitude; it will lead to the passing a vast number of laws, which may affect the personal rights of the citizens of the states, expose their property to fines and confiscation, and put their lives in jeopardy: it opens a door to the appointment of a swarm of revenue and excise officers to prey upon the honest and industrious part of the community, eat up their substance, and riot on the spoils of the country. 2d. We will next enquire into what is implied in the authority to pass all laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry this power into execution. It is, perhaps, utterly impossible fully to define this power. The authority granted in the first clause can only be understood in its full extent, by descending to all the particular cases in which a revenue can be raised; the number and variety of these cases are so endless, and as it were infinite, that no man living has, as yet, been able to reckon them up. The greatest geniuses in the world have been for ages employed in the research, and when mankind had supposed that the subject was exhausted they have been astonished with the refined improvements that have been made in modern times, and especially in the English nation on the subject—If then the objects of this power cannot be comprehended, how is it possible to understand the extent of that power which can pass all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying it into execution? It is truly incomprehensible. A case cannot be conceived of, which is not included in this power. It is well known that the subject of revenue is the most difficult and extensive in the science of government. It requires the greatest talents of a statesman, and the most numerous and exact provisions of the legislature. The command of the revenues of a state gives the command of every thing in it.—He that has the purse will have the sword, and they that have both, have every thing; so that the legislature having every source from which money can be drawn under their direction, with a right to make all laws necessary and proper for drawing forth all the resource[s] of the country, would have, in fact, all power. [414] Were I to enter into the detail, it would be easy to shew how this power in its operation, would totally destroy all the powers of the individual states. But this is not necessary for those who will think for themselves, and it will be useless to such as take things upon trust, nothing will awaken them to reflection, until the iron hand of oppression compel them to it. I shall only remark, that this power, given to the federal legislature, directly annihilates all the powers of the state legislatures. There cannot be a greater solecism in politics than to talk of power in a government, without the command of any revenue. It is as absurd as to talk of an animal without blood, or the subsistence of one without food. Now the general government having in their controul every possible source of revenue, and authority to pass any law they may deem necessary to draw them forth, or to facilitate their collection; no source of revenue is therefore left in the hands of any state. Should any state attempt to raise money by law, the general government may repeal or arrest it in the execution, for all their laws will be the supreme law of the land: If then any one can be weak enough to believe that a government can exist without having the authority to raise money to pay a door-keeper to their assembly, he may believe that the state government can exist, should this new constitution take place. It is agreed by most of the advocates of this new system, that the government which is proper for the United States should be a confederated one; that the respective states ought to retain a portion of their sovereignty, and that they should preserve not only the forms of their legislatures, but also the power to conduct certain internal concerns. How far the powers to be retained by the states shall extend, is the question; we need not spend much time on this subject, as it respects this constitution, for a government without the power to raise money is one only in name. It is clear that the legislatures of the respective states must be altogether dependent on the will of the general legislature, for the means of supporting their government. The legislature of the United States will have a right to exhaust every source of revenue in every state, and to annul all laws of the states which may stand in the way of effecting it; unless therefore we can suppose the state governments can exist without money to support the officers who execute them, we must conclude they will exist no longer than the general legislatures choose they should. Indeed the idea of any government existing, in any respect, as an independent one, without any means of support in their own hands, is an absurdity. If therefore, this constitution has in view, what many of its framers and advocates say it has, to [415]secure and guarantee to the separate states the exercise of certain powers of government it certainly ought to have left in their hands some sources of revenue. It should have marked the line in which the general government should have raised money, and set bounds over which they should not pass, leaving to the separate states other means to raise supplies for the support of their governments, and to discharge their respective debts. To this it is objected, that the general government ought to have power competent to the purposes of the union; they are to provide for the common defence, to pay the debts of the United States, support foreign ministers, and the civil establishment of the union, and to do these they ought to have authority to raise money adequate to the purpose. On this I observe, that the state governments have also contracted debts, they require money to support their civil officers, and how this is to be done, if they give to the general government a power to raise money in every way in which it can possibly be raised, with such a controul over the state legislatures as to prohibit them, whenever the general legislature may think proper, from raising any money. It is again objected that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to draw the line of distinction between the powers of the general and state governments on this subject. The first, it is said, must have the power of raising the money necessary for the purposes of the union, if they are limited to certain objects the revenue may fall short of a sufficiency for the public exigencies, they must therefore have discretionary power. The line may be easily and accurately drawn between the powers of the two governments on this head. The distinction between external and internal taxes, is not a novel one in this country, it is a plain one, and easily understood. The first includes impost duties on all imported goods; this species of taxes it is proper should be laid by the general government; many reasons might be urged to shew that no danger is to be apprehended from their exercise of it. They may be collected in few places, and from few hands with certainty and expedition. But few officers are necessary to be imployed in collecting them, and there is no danger of oppression in laying them, because, if they are laid higher than trade will bear, the merchants will cease importing, or smuggle their goods. We have therefore sufficient security, arising from the nature of the thing, against burdensome, and intolerable impositions from this kind of tax. But the case is far otherwise with regard to direct taxes; these include poll taxes, land taxes, excises, duties on written instruments, on every thing we eat, drink, or wear; they take hold of every species of property, and come home to every man’s house and packet. These are often so oppressive, as to grind the face of the [416]poor, and render the lives of the common people a burden to them. The great and only security the people can have against oppression from this kind of taxes, must rest in their representatives. If they are sufficiently numerous to be well informed of the circumstances, and ability of those who send them, and have a proper regard for the people, they will be secure. The general legislature, as I have shewn in a former paper,3 will not be thus qualified, and therefore, on this account, ought not to exercise the power of direct taxation. If the power of laying imposts will not be sufficient, some other specific mode of raising a revenue should have been assigned the general government; many may be suggested in which their power may be accurately defined and limited, and it would be much better to give them authority to lay and collect a duty on exports, not to exceed a certain rate per cent, than to have surrendered every kind of resource that the country has, to the complete abolition of the state governments, and which will introduce such an infinite number of laws and ordinances, fines and penalties, courts, and judges, collectors, and excisemen, that when a man can number them, he may enumerate the stars of Heaven. I shall resume this subject in my next,4 and by an induction of particulars shew, that this power, in its exercise, will subvert all state authority, and will work to the oppression of the people, and that there are no restrictions in the constitution that will soften its rigour, but rather the contrary."

The next objection that arises against this proffered constitution is, that the apportionment of representatives and direct taxes are unjust.—The words as expressed in this article are, “representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may [417]be included in this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed three fifths of all other persons.” In order to elucidate this, it will be necessary to repeat the remark in my last number,1 that the mode of legislation in the infancy of free communities was by the collective body, and this consisted of free persons, or those whose age admitted them to the rights of mankind and citizenship—whose sex made them capable of protecting the state, and whose birth may be denominated Free Born, and no traces can be found that even women, children, and slaves, or those who were not sui juris,2 in the early days of legislation, meeting with the free members of the community to deliberate on public measures; hence is derived this maxim in free governments, that representation ought to bear a proportion to the number of free inhabitants in a community; this principle your own state constitution, and others, have observed in the establishment of a future census, in order to apportion the representatives, and to increase or diminish the representation to the ratio of the increase or diminution of electors.3 But, what aid can the community derive from the assistance of women, infants, and slaves, in their deliberation, or in their defence? and what motive therefore could the convention have in departing from the just and rational principle of representation, which is the governing principle of this state and of all America. The doctrine of taxation is a very important one, and nothing requires more wisdom and prudence than the regulation of that portion, which is taken from, and of that which is left to, the subject—and if you anticipate, what will be the enormous expence of this new government added also to your own, little will that portion be which will be left to you. I know there are politicians who believe, that you should be loaded with taxes, in order to make you industrious, and, perhaps, there were some of this opinion in the convention, but it is an erroneous principle—For, what can inspire you with industry, if the greatest measures of your labours are to be swallowed up in taxes? The advocates for this new system hold out an idea, that you will have but little to pay, for, that the revenues will be so managed as to be almost wholly drawn from the source of trade or duties on imports, but this is delusive—for this government to discharge all its incidental expences, besides paying the interests on the home and foreign debts, will require more money than its commerce can afford; and if you reflect one moment, you will find, that if heavy duties are laid on merchandize, as must be the case, if government intend to make this the prime medium to lighten the people of taxes, that the price of the commodities, useful [418]as well as luxurious, must be increased; the consumers will be fewer; the merchants must import less; trade will languish, and this source of revenue in a great measure be dried up; but if you examine this a little further, you will find, that this revenue, managed in this way, will come out of you and be a very heavy and ruinous one, at least—The merchant no more than advances the money for you to the public, and will not, nor cannot pay any part of it himself, and if he pays more duties, he will sell his commodities at a price portionably raised—thus the laborer, mechanic, and farmer, must feel it in the purchase of their utensils and clothing—wages, &c. must rise with the price of things, or they must be ruined, and that must be the case with the farmer, whose produce will not increase, in the ratio, with labour, utensils, and clothing; for that he must sell at the usual price or lower, perhaps, caused by the decrease of trade; the consequence will be, that he must mortgage his farm, and then comes inevitable bankruptcy. In what manner then will you be eased, if the expences of government are to be raised solely out of the commerce of this country; do you not readily apprehend the fallacy of this argument. But government will find, that to press so heavily on commerce will not do, and therefore must have recourse to other objects; these will be a capitation or poll-tax, window lights, &c. &c. and a long train of impositions which their ingenuity will suggest; but will you submit to be numbered like the slaves of an arbitrary despot; and what will be your reflections when the tax-master thunders at your door for the duty on that light which is the bounty of heaven. It will be the policy of the great landholders who will chiefly compose this senate, and perhaps a majority of this house of representatives, to keep their lands free from taxes; and this is confirmed by the failure of every attempt to lay a land-tax in this state; hence recourse must and will be had to the sources I mentioned before. The burdens on you will be insupportable—your complaints will be inefficacious—this will beget public disturbances, and I will venture to predict, without the spirit of prophecy, that you and the government, if it is adopted, will one day be at issue on this point. The force of government will be exerted, this will call for an increase of revenue, and will add fuel to the fire. The result will be, that either you will revolve to some other form, or that government will give peace to the country, by destroying the opposition. If government therefore can, notwithstanding every opposition, raise a revenue on such things as are odious and burdensome to you, they can do any thing. But why should the number of individuals be the principle to apportion the taxes in each state, and to include in that number, women, children and slaves. The most natural and equitable principle of apportioning taxes, would be in a ratio to their property, and a reasonable [419]impost in a ratio to their trade; but you are told to look for the reason of these things in accommodation; but this much admired principle, when striped of its mistery, will in this case appear to be no less than a basis for an odious poll-tax—the offspring of despotic governments, a thing so detestable, that the state of Maryland, in their bill of rights, declares, “that the levying taxes by the poll, is grievous and oppressive, and ought to be abolished.”4—A poll-tax is at all times oppressive to the poor, and their greatest misfortune will consist in having more prolific wives than the rich. In every civilized community, even in those of the most democratic kind, there are principles which lead to an aristocracy—these are superior talents, fortunes, and public employments. But in free governments, the influence of the two former is resisted by the equality of the laws, and the latter by the frequency of elections, and the chance that every one has in sharing in public business; but when this natural and artificial eminence is assisted by principles interwoven in this government—when the senate, so important a branch of the legislature, is so far removed from the people, as to have little or no connexion with them; when their duration in office is such as to have the resemblance to perpetuity, when they are connected with the executive, by the appointment of all officers, and also, to become a judiciary for the trial of officers of their own appointments: added to all this, when none but men of oppulence will hold a seat, what is there left to resist and repel this host of influence and power. Will the feeble efforts of the house of representatives, in whom your security ought to subsist, consisting of about seventy-three, be able to hold the balance against them, when, from the fewness of the number in this house, the senate will have in their power to poison even a majority of that body by douceurs of office for themselves or friends. From causes like this both Montesquieu and Hume have predicted the decline of the British government into that of an absolute one;5 but the liberties of this country, it is probable if this system is adopted, will be strangled in their birth; for whenever the executive and senate can destroy the independence of the majority in the house of representatives then where is your security?—They are so intimately connected, that their interests will be one and the same; and will the slow increase of numbers be able to afford a repelling principle? but you are told to adopt this government first, and you will always be able to alter it afterwards; this would be first submitting to be slaves and then taking care of your liberty; and when your chains are on, then to act like freemen. Complete acts of legislation, which are to become the supreme law of the land, ought to be the united act of all the branches of government; but there is one of the most important duties may be managed [420]by the senate and executive alone, and to have all the force of the law paramount without the aid or interference of the house of representatives; that is the power of making treaties. This power is a very important one, and may be exercised in various ways, so as to affect your person and property, and even the domain of the nation. By treaties you may defalcate part of the empire; engagements may be made to raise an army, and you may be transported to Europe, to fight the wars of ambitious princes; money may be contracted for, and you must pay it; and a thousand other obligations may be entered into; all which will become the supreme law of the land, and you are bound by it. If treaties are erroneously or wickedly made who is there to punish—the executive can always cover himself with the plea, that he was advised by the senate, and the senate being a collective body are not easily made accountable for mal-administration. On this account we are in a worse situation than Great-Britain, where they have secured by a ridiculous fiction, the King from accountability, by declaring; that he can do no wrong; by which means the nation can have redress against his minister; but with us infalibility pervades every part of the system, and neither the executive nor his council, who are a collective body, and his advisers, can be brought to punishment for mal-administration."
Newspaper,No,Democritus,,New York Journal,The Examiner,12/14/1787,"To the Examiner, in [the] Register of 11th inst. I really pity you, sir, I pity you when I consider the herculean task which you have undertaken; a task infinitely above your abilities; a task which all the aristocratics in America cannot execute: I allude to your promise of refuting the republican writers; it shews great vanity, but little sense. You say “the antifederalists have made a great deal of bustle and noise against the new constitution,” that republicans have condemned it. I grant; that they have condemned it without reason, has not been proved; and that they will continue to point out its defects, and oppose its adoption, aristocratics will experience to their great mortification. The able writers, on the side of liberty, have opened the eyes of the deluded votaries of tyranny, have convinced every reflecting man, that the proposed government will blast the rights of mankind, will annihilate those inestimable liberties, for which we have suffered, for which we have bled; and for which, many of our brave countrymen, have sacrificed their lives. You proceed in that style of candor, which so eminently distinguishes your party, to assert, that the republicans are convinced that the government, which they oppose, is the best that ever was framed; this is as [422]much as saying, because you think like a blockhead, every other person must be of your opinion. While, sir, I disapprove of your sentiments, I admire the elegance of your language, and the acrimony of your wit; hodge podge, is a polite, a happy expression; how fortunate are some people in possessing brilliant talents, and great knowledge? hodge-podge is alone sufficient to immortalize your name; I suppose it is a word of your own coining; O the force of genius! hodge-podge! What a severe stroke you gave the fellow, who attempted to prove that light was darkness; it is so good that it cannot be too often repeated; here I set it down, as one of the most extraordinary effusions of wit, with which the world ever was gratified; “I replied, sir, you do not possess a single grain of understanding, inasmuch as all that region is closed upon you which is above the sphere of rationality, and that only is open to you which is below the rational sphere.” Mr. Examiner, this was too sarcastic; no wonder the poor man “turned from you in a furious passion.” it might have metamorphased him into a statue. You are, sir, unmercifully severe upon these republican writers; how angry must they have been when they read that bitter simile, wherein you compared them to owls: I, however, cannot perceive any similarity between a writer and an owl, unless, indeed, the former, like yourself, be destitute of every particle of good sense, and consequently resemble the latter in irrationality. I cannot take my leave of you, sir, without giving you credit for the only candid observation in your work. You deny the partiality, attributed to the editor of this paper, by persons who endeavour to palliate their own, in fixing a similar imputation upon him. I will not (like the boyish Cæsar) promise to follow you,2 least your future productions (as is very probable from a consideration of the present one) should be so excessively foolish and weak, that it would be highly disgraceful to honor them with notice; indeed I should not have noticed you at all, if I had not accidentally felt an inclination to be merry at the expence of your absurdities."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,12/15/1787,"⟨Letters from a Gentleman in Dutchess-County to his Friend in New-York. (Continued from this Register of the 3d. inst.)2 December 8th 1787. Dear Sir, When I closed my third letter, I wished to be more explicit on some things which I had mentioned in that, as well as to make several observations on the new constitution, as it is called; but the conveyance waited, and time would not admit of saying any further. I will now resume the affair of calling a convention.⟩ When I said, that I could not see the propriety, or necessity, of the legislatures calling a convention, it was merely on the principle of calling one in consequence of the resolve or recommendation of the late convention, at Philadelphia;3 lest the people should infer, that the legislature, by recommending a state convention, considered the proceedings and resolve [425]of the Philadelphia convention in some measure obligatory on them so to do. When, as the latter rejected the authority of those by whom they were appointed (at least, that appears to me to have been the case with the delegate of this state, as well as with the delegates of several other states) and renounced all allegiance to the present United States, I cannot admit to be binding on the legislature, in any manner whatever, even had the late convention really offered a good constitution. But, as it is, I cannot help being of opinion, that the resolve or recommendation is an aggravation, if possible, of the crime and insult.—Should the legislature, when they meet, think that the calling of a convention will be the best means of restoring public tranquility, I shall acquiesce. But then, I wish them not to do it from a sense of any obligation which they are under to the act of their delegate,4 or that of the delegates of any other state, in the late convention; as the exorbitant act of that body, has, in my opinion, cancelled all obligation, on the part of this state, for considering their proceedings as binding. I should therefore be glad to see them very explicit on such a most extraordinary emergency; for surely such it must appear to all unprejudiced minds. It is to be hoped, that they will ascribe the effects to their true causes, which were, an evident want of duty, and an inordinate desire for unlimited power, in some of the members who composed the convention; at the same time, pointing out to the people, in the plainest manner, the snare which is laid for them, and, that the adopting of it, will be their last sovereign act, unless it should be a violent resumption, by arms. I imagine, that the faction were rather apprehensive of a reprimand, when they referred their plot to conventions of the people, “for their assent and ratification,” in preference to the legislatures, by whom they had been appointed, and from whom they derived all the authority which they had to assemble for a very different purpose. Though, in their reference of it to conventions of the people; they have not been much more polite to those bodies, than they have to the legislatures, and that you must have observed; as it is not submitted to the former for their consideration, improvement, or rejection; but expressly “for their assent and ratification;” which seems to exclude all manner of choice! Was ever self-sufficiency more evident in man? The legislatures are advised to call conventions of the people for registering the revolt of their citizens and deputies, as the supreme law of the land!—Could any thing be more humiliating to sovereign and independent states?—Would this junto have dared to offer such an indignity to any sovereign prince in Europe, had they been appointed by one?—I know that your answer must be in the negative. Why then thus [426]presumptuously attempt to prostrate thirteen sovereignties?—But the answer is obvious, and therefore not requisite at this time. If the legislature should not be pointedly clear on such an open attempt to dissolve the present confederacy, may we not, in a little time, expect a Shays, or, perhaps, a much more formidable insurgent in this state? Have you considered the tendency of the 2d paragraph of the 6th article of the NEW EDICT?—It does not appear to me, that either the Centinel, Federal Farmer, or any other writer that I have seen, has sufficiently attended to that clause, and all the consequences which it may involve. I am sensible, that the Centinel calls it a “sweeping clause;”5 but, I imagine, not on account of what I am going to observe, or he would have been more explicit. These are the words:—“This constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, &c.” You well know that I am not fond of disputing about words, unless they have an evident tendency to deceive or lead to error, in which case, I think, they ought to be thoroughly canvassed, and well understood, especially in an affair of such vast importance as the present. The word “supreme” is, I believe, generally received, in law and divinity, as an adjective of the superlative degree, and implies the highest in dignity or authority, &c. Now, if we analyze this clause, we shall see how it will appear. The constitution is to be the high-authority—the laws made in pursuance of the constitution are to be the highest authority, and all treaties made, or to be made are to be the highest authority; and yet there is to be but one highest authority! However easy it may be for the contrivers of this, to reconcile it to their own views, I confess to you, that it appears to me something like creed-making. If all the laws and treaties which may be made, in pursuance of this constitution (provided it be adopted) are to be of as high authority, as the constitution, I should be glad to know what security we can have for any one right, however sacred or essential, when there is no explicit proviso, that the laws and treaties which may be made, shall not be repugnant to the constitution? It is true, that they are to be made in pursuance of the constitution; but, pursuance is a vague term, and, I presume, generally implies little more than “in consequence, &c.”—I have always understood, that the laws derived all their just authority from the constitution, or social compact, as it is sometimes called; and that the latter receives its whole authority, in free governments, from the common consent of the people, [427]and recognizes or acknowledges all their essential rights and liberties, as well as ascertains the reciprocal duties or relations between the governed and their governors, or, perhaps, more properly, their principal public servants, who undertake to manage or conduct the affairs of the community agreeable to certain fixed stipulations, which are mentioned in the original compact or constitution, and not otherwise, but at the risk of being disobeyed, or opposed, as the case may require. If these ideas of a free government are just, ought there not to have been a positive distinction between the authority of the constitution and that of the laws, treaties, &c. The constitution, when once government is organized, will be mostly passive, but the laws, treaties, &c. of Congress, will be active and voluminous; whence it is easy to foresee what will become of the passive supremacy of it, when it happens to come in competition with two active supremacies, which are coeval and coequal with it, besides several others which will be added, you may rely: For there must be the supreme Lex Parliamentaria of a meagre, biennial representation of the people, and another of an encroaching lordly sexennial Senate, with the supreme prerogatives of a poor, greedy, quadrennial monarch, who must ever be ready to concur in any measures for fleecing the people, provided he is but allowed to participate of the spoil. And, to crown the whole, there must, of course, be a most supreme standing army for us to feed, clothe and pay, if you will pardon the redundancy of the phrase. Does it not appear to you, as if the framers of this clause had profited by the embarrassments which the British ministry frequently met with in their attempts to render acts of parliament, paramount to magna charta, or the great charter of the peoples essential rights, which is acknowleged, by the 43d. of Edward the 3d. not to be in the power of parliament to alter, change, or destroy; as all statutes made or to be made, against, or contrary to that constitution, or bill of rights, are, immediately, to be considered as null and void?6 I have many more observations to make on this political phenomenon, as well as its origination; but domestic affairs require my attention, and I must bid you adieu until another opportunity. I am, dear sir, Very respectfully, Your’s &c. A COUNTRYMAN. To a Citizen."
Newspaper,No,A Friend to Common Sense,,New York Journal,,12/19/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, As it is the duty of men, who reverence religion, to discountenance impiety and vice, so it is incumbent on those, who respect good sense, to express their disapprobation of folly, and to use their utmost endeavors to shame its votaries into a course of conduct more consistent with the dignity of rational beings: this consideration induces me, to animadvert upon the Examiner in your paper of the 14th inst. Nothing can make a man more ridiculous, than the affectation of qualities, which he does not possess. The celebrated Dean Swift wrote periodical papers, in support of the Tory ministry of queen Anne, under the signature of the Examiner:2 a writer in New-York undertakes to imitate the Dean, in wit and ingenuity, styles his foolish productions, the Examiner, and, in the importance of self-sufficiency, dogmatizes with the air of ability, lashes his opponents with all the severity of dullness, and resembles his predecessor in nothing, except in his attachment to tyranny. Our second Swift is evidently unfortunate in the use of his wit—his observations are designed to be satirical, but they amount to nothing more than general censure and railing; he [Examiner] calls Cato an owl and an hypocrite, and taxes him with want of abilities; if the preservation of my life depended upon the issue, I could not discover any wit in these remarks; the person, who ascribes wit to the Examiner, must also allow, that every scavenger and chimneysweeper in the city, possesses it in the most consummate perfection; for they are, in my very humble opinion, even superior to him in the excellent qualification of blackguardism. What a farrago of nonsense is the following:—“Cato may be compared to a carved image with a double head, one within the other; the inner head cohering with the trunk or body, and the outer being moveable about the inner, and painted in front the colour of an human face, not unlike the wooden heads, exposed to view in a barber’s shop;”—would an intelligent man ever publish such a ridiculous simile and palm it upon the world as a stroke of genuine wit? such a chaos [443]of words procures the confused, unthinking head of the author. A monkey has more unexceptionable claims to reason, than the Examiner to elegance or satire. The presumption of the imitator of Swift, in supposing his capability of refuting Cato, I consider one of the most remarkable instances of self-conceit to be met with in the history of mankind; as well might a parrot attempt to correct the language of an able rhetorician. The Examiner asserts, that Cato has promised much more than he is able to perform; this is the judgment of a partial, and I may say, injudicious writer. Every man of penetration would, independently of any other consideration, conclude that Cato wrote with great force and ability: and why?—because he is attacked by a whole swarm of dunces. Our American Swift further observes, that Cato’s pieces contain nothing but bare assertions, and that he has neglected to quote the most approved writers on government, excepting one or two thread bare quotations from Montesquieu, which have appeared before, in several recent publications; one would, from these remarks, be led to suppose, that he had never read any of Cato’s productions—we must either believe this or something worse. Let him point out those recent publications which, he insinuates, are copied by Cato; with what propriety can he censure assertions, when his performance is composed of nothing but assertions: but Cato acts directly the reverse; when he gives his opinions, he at the same time, gives the reasons upon which they are founded. The Examiner, however inconsistent with common sense, acts perfectly consistent with the practices of his party; a party, chiefly made up of aristocratics, who, unable to answer the cogent reasonings of their adversaries, have recourse, as their dernier resort, to scurrility and wilful misrepresentation; who solace themselves, for the weakness of their argumentation, by the plaudits and huzzas of mercenaries and ignoramuses; who circulate falshoods, which, without any hyperbole, would fill volumes; and, who calumniate their antagonists, with all the virulence of malignity. I advise the Examiner to reflect, that the palpability of his malice will defeat its intended effect; and that, like a wounded viper, he only darts his venom into himself. As a person, who wishes well to every individual, I would advise the Examiner to desist: As a republican, I say—proceed, sir!—Nothing can be better calculated to bring your party into contempt, than such contemptible productions. December 16th, 1787."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (II),,New York Journal,,12/20/1787,"Worthy Sir, My neighbour and me have been busy almost every evening, since I wrote to you last, and sometimes we set up very late, [448]still trying all we could to find out the real meaning of this new constitution; but really, as I said before, we find it a hard matter to come at it. We cannot be reconciled to it, that people who may wish to come here from the old countries, to get clear of the oppression of great folks there, should be obliged to pay ten dollars, besides their passage and other expences, for leave to do it—and we cannot help still thinking it a very pitiful thing, in this new government, to give leave to make slaves of our fellow creatures, for the sake of a triffling sum of money:—these things set very heavy upon our mind, for we believe, that they are establishing wickedness instead of justice, let some folks pretend to what they will. We see that this new government will have power to levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises upon us; now, with respect to the duties and imposts, we suppose that is money that is to be raised upon goods and liquors, that may be brought from abroad to this country, and we are very easy about it, for we are sure the less that is brought, the better it will be for us, for the less we will have to pay for; but as to excises, some of our neighbours from the old countries, where they say, they are as common as Mayweed—tell us that they will go to almost every thing—and, that if they set to work at this, they will make us pay more for the small beer and cyder we drink, than they would fetch, if we were to sell them and drink water in their stead. As for taxes, I will warrant you, we are at no loss about the meaning of that word, for we have learned by experience to understand it pretty well—indeed many of us have been driven to our last shifts, to pay what has been demanded of us already by our own state—and, I am sure, if this new government sets about this work too, between both, we shall be sadly hampered, and ten to one, if not only our stocks, but our farms too, will be sold to satisfy the collectors: but this is not all, it seems there is to be a new sort of tax, which we have not before heard of, called a capitation-tax; I should never have found out what was meant by it, if it had not been for my neighbour, who tells me, it is a tax upon the head, and that a poor man’s head, though he is not worth a groat in the world, must pay as much, as a rich man’s head, let him be ever so wealthy;—now this appears to me very little more like justice, than the affair about the poor blacks, though it may not be quite so wicked; for, although a poor man may have as good a head and as much brains in it, as a rich man, and be as honest and as wise a man; yet, where there are any good things a going (such as any place, by which there is a deal of money or honor to be had) the rich man’s head is always best then, and, by one means or another, he finds out ways to get these things to himself; so that I think his head ought to be taxed more than the poor man’s, for it is an old and true saying, pay alike share alike: [449]besides, he has more of the good things of this world, and is better able to pay. There is one thing, worthy Sir, that has given us a deal of trouble; we have seen on reading the constitution through the first time, that there were some things mentioned which, it is said, this new government should not do—and, we thought it very right, that they should not, for to be sure they were such things, as we would not like to see done; but upon reading it over and over again, and attending to it still more carefully, we began to think between ourselves, what could be the reason of saying they should not do these things, because, as we had understood matters at first, there was no power given to this new government to do them; one of these matters I mean, is, where they say, “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States,” now it is very plain to me, if there was no power given to this new government to grant titles of nobility, (I suppose what it means is to make lords) then there was no occasion to say that they should not do it, because it would be very foolish to say, that they should not do a thing which they could not do; this, as I said before, made us examine it again, and that very closely, and to be sure, to our great surprise, we found out some clauses, and some big words that we had not before taken notice of, appear to carry with them a very broad meaning, and though they did not just mention any thing about making lords, or (as it is called) granting titles of nobility, yet it very well may be, that these clauses give them power to do every thing, only, what it is said, they should not do—and my neighbour who understands what he reads better than me, thinks this must be the case, for he can’t believe that such wise men, as they say, the convention was made up of, and a great many of them judges and lawyers too, would have ever taken so much pains to guard against this new government’s doing things, which they would have had no power to do. But, as this seemed to us a matter of no little consequence, and we did not like to be in a mistake about it—my neighbour, who stands well with the young lawyers, and lads who are looking out for public employments, asked me to come over the next evening to his house, for he would have a parcel of them there, and we would try whether we could not find out their opinion about this matter; I accordingly went the next evening to my neighbour’s, and there, as he promised, he had a number of them—he soon began to talk with them about the new constitution, and mentioned several of the difficulties we had met with to understand it, and some things in it which appeared to us not to be right; such as the taking away the trial by jury, head-tax business, and encouraging the making slaves of our fellow-creatures; but we found they did not like to speak much [450]about it, and that they were very loth to say a word against it, they seemed indeed, to think there might be some small things in it which might have been as well left out; but, upon the whole, they said it would do very well, and that when we once got it agoing, we could mend it; and that something must be done, or we will all git into anarchy (as they called it) and confusion; my neighbour asked them, whether it would not be the best and safest way to mend it first, for fear if we once parted with so much power, as was given to this new government, we could never git it back again, and put them in mind of what Mr. Beccaria2 and other great men (whose names I do not remember) had said about giving more powers than were necessary to rulers; but, they did not like this and said, if we once began to alter, we should never agree about it, and get a quarrelling with one another. Indeed, good sir, I have but very indifferent thoughts (to say no worse) about these young men, for though I hear that in other places many of their cloth are very honest, and think very right about matters, yet those among us appear to be guided entirely by their own interest; they hold themselves above their neighbours, and seem to think themselves better and wiser than every body else, and I have heard that they do not scruple saying in private, that this new government would be a fine thing for them; that it will make a great deal more law business; that they will git higher costs; and that it will not be in the power of the country-members to keep lowering them as they have done lately, for the state legislatures will have nothing to do with these grand courts or any thing else of consequence, for which, they say, they are not fit. It is even said, that some of the young men who are looking for places, are so taken in with the notion of a standing army, that they have already bespoke cloth at the shop-keepers for regimentals. Now for my share, I am fully of my neighbours opinion, that it would be best to mend this new government before we agree to take it, for if we cannot agree to make it good now without quarrelling, I do not see how we will agree to do it afterwards—indeed, I think, it will be much harder; for those that have once got the power, I am afraid, will be very unwilling to part with it—they tell me it is no common thing, nay, some go so far as to say, it has never been known to happen. I should think it a very unwise thing to pull down an old house, in which I lived very comfortably for many years, and which had sheltered me and my family, and move into a new house, just to gratify the pride and vanity of the children, because it was larger and appeared finer, on the outside, when I knew at the same time, that it was not well finished within, that the foundation was bad, the chimnies smoky, the roof leaky, and many of the posts rotten, [451]so as to make it dangerous to go in it, and that it would cost me more than I was worth in the world to furnish and keep it in repair, and I am apt to believe if I got ruined by it, I should meet with few to pity me; and yet it is strange, we are told if we do not do something as foolish as this about the new government, we shall get a quarrelling; but let them quarrel that will, I am for continuing peaceably in the old house, and for mending it now and then, as it stands in need of it. I observe from the papers you sent me, that those who are warmly in favor of this new government, say, that it will make us able to pay our debts, establish our credit, and make us respectable abroad; but I cannot see how it is to do all these good things, and they have not undertaken to tell us; I think it but a poor way to pay debts, by getting a more costly government, and I cannot see that it will establish our credit, by being fickle and changing every day from one thing to another; I am sure an unsteady whimsical man, is but illy trusted by his neighbors, for few will put any dependence upon him; and I believe it will be pretty much the case with a government, that is always changing, for though it might be something this year, that we liked very well, and were very fond of, next year it might be changed into something else that we did not like at all, and could not bear to live under; and I can hardly think, it would make us very respectable abroad, when the people in the old countries found out, that we could not be contented, neither with the one thing or the other, and did not know what we would be at ourselves; besides, for my own part, I think we ought first to make ourselves happy at home, and I believe that will be found the best way to make people abroad think well of us. O my good friend, we ought carefully to guard against the pride and vanity of our hearts, which are always taking us from the good old way, and leading of us into new schemes and devices, and are dangerous enemies to our happiness both here, and hereafter; if our great men were oftener to read their bibles, they would find many lessons on this head, which might be of great service to them, and fit them better for the high places to which they are called; they might profit much on the present occasion by attending to the history of the Children of Israel, as recorded in that holy book; they did not trust in the promises, which were made them by their heavenly father through his holy prophets; they were restless under the government, which was appointed over them by the Almighty; they were fickle and fond of changing; they were ambitious, and wanted to appear respectable abroad; they must be like all the nations, have a king to judge them, and to go out before them, and fight their battles; notwithstanding, that good prophet Samuel protested [452]solemnly against it, by the command of our maker, and shewed them the manner of the king that should reign over them, yet they would have a new government, and they got Saul the son of kish for a king;3 the history of whose wicked reign I need not relate to you.4 O my dear sir, we ought to be much in prayer with God, least the same temper which seems to prevail too much at this day among many of us, should bring down upon our land also some heavy judgment; for to me it appears as if there was a rod in soak for us. I remain, Honoured Sir, Your real friend, And humble servant. A COUNTRYMAN."
Letter,No,"Robert Yates, John Lansing",George Clinton,,,12/21/1787,"SIR, We do ourselves the honor to advise your Excellency, that, in pursuance of concurrent resolutions of the Honorable Senate and Assembly, we have, together with Mr. Hamilton, attended the Convention appointed for revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting amendments to the same. It is with the sincerest concern we observe, that in the prosecution of the important objects of our mission, we have been reduced to the disagreeable alternative of either exceeding the powers delegated to us, and giving our assent to measures which we conceived destructive of the political happiness of the citizens of the United States; or opposing our opinion to that of a body of respectable men, to whom those citizens had given the most unequivocal proofs of confidence. Thus circumstanced, under these impressions, to have hesitated would have been to be culpable. We therefore gave the principles of the Constitution, which has received the sanction of a majority of the Convention, our decided and unreserved dissent; but we must candidly confess, that we should have been equally opposed to any system, however modified, which had in object the consolidation of the United States into one Government. We beg leave briefly to state some cogent reasons which, among others, influenced us to decide against a consolidation of the States. These are reducible into two heads. First. The limited and well defined powers under which we acted, and which could not, on any possible construction, embrace an idea of such magnitude as to assent to a general Constitution in subversion of that of the State. Secondly. A conviction of the impracticability of establishing a general Government, pervading every part of the United States, and extending essential benefits to all. Our powers were explicit, and confined to the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting such alterations and provisions therein, as should render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government, and the preservation of the Union. From these expressions, we were led to believe that a system of consolidated Government, could not, in the remotest degree, have been in contemplation of the Legislature of this State, for that so important a trust, as the adopting measures which tended to deprive the State Government of its most essential rights of Sovereignty, and to place it in a dependent situation, could not have been confided, by implication, and the circumstance, that the acts of the Convention were to receive a State approbation, in the last resort, forcibly corroborated the opinion, that our powers could not involve the subversion of a Constitution, which being immediately derived from the people, could only be abolished by their express consent, and not by a Legislature, possessing authority vested in them for its preservation. Nor could we suppose, that if it had been the intention of the Legislature to abrogate the [458]existing Confederation, they would, in such pointed terms, have directed the attention of their delegates to the revision and amendment of it, in total exclusion of every other idea. Reasoning in this manner, we were of opinion, that the leading feature of every amendment ought to be the preservation of the individual States, in their uncontroled constitutional rights; and that, in reserving these, a mode might have been devised, of granting to the Confederacy, the monies arising from a general system of revenue, the power of regulating commerce, and enforcing the observance of Foreign treaties, and other necessary matters of less moment. Exclusive of our objections, originating from the want of power, we entertained an opinion that a general Government, however guarded by declarations of rights or cautionary provisions, must unavoidably, in a short time, be productive of the destruction of the civil liberty of such citizens who could be effectually coerced by it; by reason of the extensive territory of the United States; the dispersed situation of its inhabitants, and the insuperable difficulty of controling or counteracting the views of a set of men (however unconstitutional and oppressive their acts might be) possessed of all the powers of Government, and who, from their remoteness from their constituents, and necessary permanency of office, could not be supposed to be uniformly actuated by an attention to their welfare and happiness; that however wise and energetic the principles of the general Government might be, the extremities of the United States could not be kept in due submission and obedience to its laws at the distance of many hundred miles from the seat of Government; that if the general Legislature was composed of so numerous a body of men as to represent the interest of all the inhabitants of the United States in the usual and true ideas of representation, the expence of supporting it would become intolerably burthensome, and that if a few only were invested with a power of legislation, the interests of a great majority of the inhabitants of the United States must necessarily be unknown, or if known even in the first stages of the operations of the new Government, unattended to. These reasons were in our opinion conclusive against any system of consolidated Government: to that recommended by the Convention we suppose most of them forcibly apply. It is not our intention to pursue this subject further than merely to explain our conduct in the discharge of the trust which the Honorable the Legislature reposed in us—interested however, as we are in common with our fellow citizens in the result, we cannot forbear to declare that we have the strongest apprehensions that a Government so organized [459]as that recommended by the Convention, cannot afford that security to equal and permanent liberty, which we wished to make an invariable object of our pursuit. We were not present at the completion of the New Constitution; but before we left the Convention, its principles were so well established as to convince us that no alteration was to be expected, to conform it to our ideas of expediency and safety. A persuasion that our further attendance would be fruitless and unavailing, rendered us less solicitous to return. We have thus explained our motives for opposing the adoption of the National Constitution, which we conceived it our duty to communicate to your Excellency, to be submitted to the consideration of the Hon. Legislature. We have the Honor to be, with the greatest Respect, your Excellency’s most obedient and very humble Servants,"
Newspaper,No,Democritus,,New York Journal,The Examiner,12/21/1787,"Most sublime, most witty, and most elegant EXAMINER! ! I bow down before you; I am vanquished by the ascendency, which your all-powerful, transcendant abilities, have over your obedient, abject slave. Although you have thought fit, in the majesty of your justice, to scourge me with your august displeasure, and severe sarcasms, for presuming to differ from you in opinion; yet, I have such great confidence in your benevolence and compassion, that I hope to be admitted into your favor; which is most earnestly desired by me, when I consider that you are not only an eminent writer, but also a most renowned physician, and consequently able to remove the drunkeness, which you say, has attacked your servant. That you are deeply versed in both surgery and physic, I observe, from the technical terms, with which you have interlarded your third lecture; and which, I cannot read, without praying, that you would, as you profess pity and compassion for me, take away “the serene gut which obstructs my optic nerves,” so that I may thoroughly understand your Solomon Gundy and other high-flown and learned words.2 That I may do something to merit your patronage and favor, I will here inform you of divers plans, which (if I enjoy health and live long enough) I intend to execute; and humbly request your sublimity to acquaint me, whether they engage your approbation. I purpose to collect from your judicious works, a book of similies, and metaphors; as a specimen take the following: Like Solomon Gundy. Noctural glare of the antifederal owl. Bright sun of the federal dove. Fixing a pearl into a swine’s snout. Like a diamond thrown into the mud. Like an elastic ball thrown against the side of a house. I also purpose to compile a dictionary of Medical terms, from your learned writings; by what follows, you will observe, I have a large stock of them already. Delicate organs. Gutta serena. Indigested. Optic nerves. Foul Stomach. Fever. Very costive. Uncured. Six discharges. Infected. Kindly injections. Disorder. Eyes anointed. I furthermore intend, to compose a book of medical observation, and receipt, from your works. For instance, “Solomon Gundy, composed of raw fish and flesh, is calculated to throw the person who eats it into a fever.” A man of your extensive reading, must well know, that it is the practice in England, to comprise, the beautiful reflections, and striking excellencies of eminent writers, into small volumes, and style them the Beauties of Shakespear, Blair,3 Johnson, &c. Now as your performances contain many rare, elegant, and uncommon observations, I mean to publish a book, and entitle it—The Beauties of the Examiner. e. g. Perfection. The works of a finite being cannot be perfect. Examiner, No. III. Composition. The works of a writer,4 destitute of both genius and information, must be very dull and insipid, because he has no genius and information. Idem, something abbreviated. I hope you will accept these my intentions in good part, and forgive my late impudence, as I have forgiven your severity. When I revolve in my mind the merits of your writings, I am astonished at your universal knowledge. This is the only exception I have ever known to your profound remark—that the works of a finite being [461]cannot be perfect; for you seem to be a complete master of the whole circle of human learning. Your works shew that you are —A chymist; for you speak of the absorption of mud.5 —A natural philosopher; for you speak of the elastic ball. —A logician; for you speak of analogy, logical justness, argumentative precision, and sophistry. —A metaphysician; for you speak of evil, infinity, scepticism, perfection, and blind fate —A mathematician; for you speak of proportion. —A soothsayer; for you speak of enchantment and witch craft. —A rhetorician; for you speak of hodge-podge. —A cook; for you speak of Solomon Gundy, composed of raw fish and flesh. —A swine-keeper; for you speak of ringing hogs snouts.

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,12/27/1787,"It is an important question, whether the general government of the United States should be so framed, as to absorb and swallow up the state governments? or whether, on the contrary, the former ought not to be confined to certain defined national objects, while the latter should retain all the powers which concern the internal police of the states? I have, in my former papers, offered a variety of arguments to prove, that a simple free government could not be exercised over this whole continent, and that therefore we must either give up our liberties and submit to an arbitrary one, or frame a constitution on the plan of confederation. Further reasons might be urged to prove this point—but it seems unnecessary, because the principal advocates of the new constitution admit of the position. The question therefore between us, this being admitted, is, whether or not this system is so formed as either directly to annihilate the state governments, or that in its operation it will certainly effect it. If this is answered in the affirmative, then the system ought not to be adopted, without such amendments as will avoid this consequence. If on the contrary it can be shewn, that the state governments are secured in their rights to manage the internal police of the respective states, we must confine ourselves in our enquiries to the organization of the government and the guards and provisions it contains to prevent a misuse or abuse of power. To determine this question, it is requisite, that we fully investigate the nature, and the extent of the powers intended to be granted by this constitution to the rulers. [467] In my last number2 I called your attention to this subject, and proved, as I think, uncontrovertibly, that the powers given the legislature under the 8th section of the 1st article, had no other limitation than the discretion of the Congress. It was shewn, that even if the most favorable construction was given to this paragraph, that the advocates for the new constitution could wish, it will convey a power to lay and collect taxes, imposts, duties, and excises, according to the discretion of the legislature, and to make all laws which they shall judge proper and necessary to carry this power into execution. This I shewed would totally destroy all the power of the state governments. To confirm this, it is worth while to trace the operation of the government in some particular instances. The general government is to be vested with authority to levy and collect taxes, duties, and excises; the separate states have also power to impose taxes, duties, and excises, except that they cannot lay duties on exports and imports without the consent of Congress. Here then the two governments have concurrent jurisdiction; both may lay impositions of this kind. But then the general government have supperadded to this power, authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying the foregoing power into execution. Suppose then that both governments should lay taxes, duties, and excises, and it should fall so heavy on the people that they would be unable, or be so burdensome that they would refuse to pay them both—would it not be necessary that the general legislature should suspend the collection of the state tax? It certainly would. For, if the people could not, or would not pay both, they must be discharged from the tax to the state, or the tax to the general government could not be collected.—The conclusion therefore is inevitable, that the respective state governments will not have the power to raise one shilling in any way, but by the permission of the Congress. I presume no one will pretend, that the states can exercise legislative authority, or administer justice among their citizens for any length of time, without being able to raise a sufficiency to pay those who administer their governments. If this be true, and if the states can raise money only by permission of the general government, it follows that the state governments will be dependent on the will of the general government for their existence. What will render this power in Congress effectual and sure in its operation is, that the government will have complete judicial and executive authority to carry all their laws into effect, which will be paramount to the judicial and executive authority of the individual states: in vain therefore will be all interference of the legislatures, courts, or magistrates of any of the states on the subject; for they will be subordinate [468]to the general government, and engaged by oath to support it, and will be constitutionally bound to submit to their decisions. The general legislature will be empowered to lay any tax they chuse, to annex any penalties they please to the breach of their revenue laws; and to appoint as many officers as they may think proper to collect the taxes. They will have authority to farm the revenues and to vest the farmer general, with his subalterns, with plenary powers to collect them, in any way which to them may appear eligible. And the courts of law, which they will be authorized to institute, will have cognizance of every case arising under the revenue laws, the conduct of all the officers employed in collecting them; and the officers of these courts will execute their judgments. There is no way, therefore, of avoiding the destruction of the state governments, whenever the Congress please to do it, unless the people rise up, and, with a strong hand, resist and prevent the execution of constitutional laws. The fear of this, will, it is presumed, restrain the general government, for some time, within proper bounds; but it will not be many years before they will have a revenue, and force, at their command, which will place them above any apprehensions on that score. How far the power to lay and collect duties and excises, may operate to dissolve the state governments, and oppress the people, it is impossible to say. It would assist us much in forming a just opinion on this head, to consider the various objects to which this kind of taxes extend, in European nations, and the infinity of laws they have passed respecting them. Perhaps, if leisure will permit, this may be essayed in some future paper. It was observed in my last number,3 that the power to lay and collect duties and excises, would invest the Congress with authority to impose a duty and excise on every necessary and convenience of life. As the principal object of the government, in laying a duty or excise, will be, to raise money, it is obvious, that they will fix on such articles as are of the most general use and consumption; because, unless great quantities of the article, on which the duty is laid, is used, the revenue cannot be considerable. We may therefore presume, that the articles which will be the object of this species of taxes will be either the real necessaries of life; or if not these, such as from custom and habit are esteemed so. I will single out a few of the productions of our own country, which may, and probably will, be of the number. Cider is an article that most probably will be one of those on which an excise will be laid, because it is one, which this country produces in great abundance, which is in very general use, is consumed in great quantities, and which may be said too not to be a real necessary of life. [469]An excise on this would raise a large sum of money in the United States. How would the power, to lay and collect an excise on cider, and to pass all laws proper and necessary to carry it into execution, operate in its exercise? It might be necessary, in order to collect the excise on cider, to grant to one man, in each county, an exclusive right of building and keeping cider-mills, and oblige him to give bonds and security for payment of the excise; or, if this was not done, it might be necessary to license the mills, which are to make this liquor, and to take from them security, to account for the excise; or, if otherwise, a great number of officers must be employed, to take account of the cider made, and to collect the duties on it. Porter, ale, and all kinds of malt-liquors, are articles that would probably be subject also to an excise. It would be necessary, in order to collect such an excise, to regulate the manufactory of these, that the quantity made might be ascertained, or otherwise security could not be had for the payment of the excise. Every brewery must then be licensed, and officers appointed, to take account of its product, and to secure the payment of the duty, or excise, before it is sold. Many other articles might be named, which would be objects of this species of taxation, but I refrain from enumerating them. It will probably be said, by those who advocate this system, that the observations already made on this head, are calculated only to inflame the minds of the people, with the apprehension of dangers merely imaginary. That there is not the least reason to apprehend, the general legislature will exercise their power in this manner. To this I would only say, that these kinds of taxes exist in Great Britain, and are severely felt. The excise on cider and perry, was imposed in that nation a few years ago, and it is in the memory of every one, who read the history of the transaction, what great tumults it occasioned.4 This power, exercised without limitation, will introduce itself into every corner of the city, and country—It will wait upon the ladies at their toilett, and will not leave them in any of their domestic concerns; it will accompany them to the ball, the play, and the assembly; it will go with them when they visit, and will, on all occasions, sit beside them in their carriages, nor will it desert them even at church; it will enter the house of every gentleman, watch over his cellar, wait upon his cook in the kitchen, follow the servants into the parlour, preside over the table, and note down all he eats or drinks; it will attend him to his bedchamber, and watch him while he sleeps; it will take cognizance of the professional man in his office, or his study; it will watch the merchant in the counting-house, or in his store; it will follow the mechanic to his shop, and in his work, and will haunt him in his family, and in his bed; [470]it will be a constant companion of the industrious farmer in all his labour, it will be with him in the house, and in the field, observe the toil of his hands, and the sweat of his brow; it will penetrate into the most obscure cottage; and finally, it will light upon the head of every person in the United States. To all these different classes of people, and in all these circumstances, in which it will attend them, the language in which it will address them, will be give! give! A power that has such latitude, which reaches every person in the community in every conceivable circumstance, and lays hold of every species of property they possess, and which has no bounds set to it, but the discretion of those who exercise it. I say, such a power must necessarily, from its very nature, swallow up all the power of the state governments. I shall add but one other observation on this head, which is this—It appears to me a solecism, for two men, or bodies of men, to have unlimited power respecting the same object. It contradicts the scripture maxim, which saith, “no man can serve two masters,”5 the one power or the other must prevail, or else they will destroy each other, and neither of them effect their purpose. It may be compared to two mechanic powers, acting upon the same body in opposite directions, the consequence would be, if the powers were equal, the body would remain in a state of rest, or if the force of the one was superior to that of the other, the stronger would prevail, and overcome the resistance of the weaker. But it is said, by some of the advocates of this system, “That the idea that Congress can levy taxes at pleasure, is false, and the suggestion wholly unsupported: that the preamble to the constitution is declaratory of the purposes of the union, and the assumption of any power not necessary to establish justice, &c. to provide for the common defence, &c. will be unconstitutional. Besides, in the very clause which gives the power of levying duties and taxes, the purposes to which the money shall be appropriated, are specified, viz. to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare.”(a) I would ask those, who reason thus, to define what ideas are included under the terms, to provide for the common defence and general welfare? Are these terms definite, and will they be understood in the same manner, and to apply to the same cases by every one? No one will pretend they will. It will then be matter of opinion, what tends to the general welfare; and the Congress will be the only judges in the matter. To provide for the general welfare, is an abstract proposition, which mankind differ in the explanation of, as much as they do on any political or moral proposition that can be proposed; the most opposite measures may be [471]pursued by different parties, and both may profess, that they have in view the general welfare; and both sides may be honest in their professions, or both may have sinister views. Those who advocate this new constitution declare, they are influenced by a regard to the general welfare; those who oppose it, declare they are moved by the same principles; and I have no doubt but a number on both sides are honest in their professions; and yet nothing is more certain than this, that to adopt this constitution, and not to adopt it, cannot both of them be promotive of the general welfare. It is as absurd to say, that the power of Congress is limited by these general expressions, “to provide for the common safety, and general welfare,” as it would be to say, that it would be limited, had the constitution said they should have power to lay taxes, &c. at will and pleasure. Were this authority given, it might be said, that under it the legislature could not do injustice, or pursue any measures, but such as were calculated to promote the public good, and happiness. For every man, rulers as well as others, are bound by the immutable laws of God and reason, always to will what is right. It is certainly right and fit, that the governors of every people should provide for the common defence and general welfare; every government, therefore, in the world, even the greatest despot, is limited in the exercise of his power. But however just this reasoning may be, it would be found, in practice, a most pitiful restriction. The government would always say, their measures were designed and calculated to promote the public good; and there being no judge between them and the people, the rulers themselves must, and would always, judge for themselves. There are others of the favourers of this system, who admit, that the power of the Congress under it, with respect to revenue, will exist without limitation, and contend, that so it ought to be. It is said, “The power to raise armies, to build and equip fleets, and to provide for their support, ought to exist without limitation, because it is impossible to foresee, or to define, the extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them.” This, it is said, “is one of those truths which, to correct and unprejudiced minds, carries its own evidence along with it. It rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal: the means ought to be proportioned to the end; the person, from whose agency the attainment of any end is expected, ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained.”(b) This same writer insinuates, that the opponents to the plan promulgated by the convention, manifests a want of candor, in objecting to [472]the extent of the powers proposed to be vested in this government; because he asserts, with an air of confidence, that the powers ought to be unlimited as to the object to which they extend; and that this position, if not self-evident, is at least clearly demonstrated by the foregoing mode of reasoning. But with submission to this author’s better judgment, I humbly conceive his reasoning will appear, upon examination, more specious than solid. The means, says the gentleman, ought to be proportioned to the end: admit the proposition to be true it is then necessary to enquire, what is the end of the government of the United States, in order to draw any just conclusions from it. Is this end simply to preserve the general government, and to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the union only? certainly not: for beside this, the state governments are to be supported, and provision made for the managing such of their internal concerns as are allotted to them. It is admitted, “that the circumstances of our country are such, as to demand a compound, instead of a simple, a confederate, instead of a sole government,” that the objects of each ought to be pointed out, and that each ought to possess ample authority to execute the powers committed to them. The government then, being complex in its nature, the end it has in view is so also; and it is as necessary, that the state governments should possess the means to attain the ends expected from them, as for the general government. Neither the general government, nor the state governments, ought to be vested with all the powers proper to be exercised for promoting the ends of government. The powers are divided between them—certain ends are to be attained by the one, and other certain ends by the other; and these, taken together, include all the ends of good government. This being the case, the conclusion follows, that each should be furnished with the means, to attain the ends, to which they are designed. To apply this reasoning to the case of revenue; the general government is charged with the care of providing for the payment of the debts of the United States; supporting the general government, and providing for the defence of the union. To obtain these ends, they should be furnished with means. But does it thence follow, that they should command all the revenues of the United States! Most certainly it does not. For if so, it will follow, that no means will be left to attain other ends, as necessary to the happiness of the country, as those committed to their care. The individual states have debts to discharge; their legislatures and executives are to be supported, and provision is to be made for the administration of justice in the respective states. For these objects the general government has no authority to provide; nor is it proper it should. It is clear then, that the states should have the command [473]of such revenues, as to answer the ends they have to obtain. To say, “that the circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite,” and from hence to infer, that all the sources of revenue in the states should be yielded to the general government, is not conclusive reasoning: for the Congress are authorized only to controul in general concerns, and not regulate local and internal ones; and these are as essentially requisite to be provided for as those. The peace and happiness of a community is as intimately connected with the prudent direction of their domestic affairs, and the due administration of justice among themselves, as with a competent provision for their defence against foreign invaders, and indeed more so. Upon the whole, I conceive, that there cannot be a clearer position than this, that the state governments ought to have an uncontroulable power to raise a revenue, adequate to the exigencies of their governments; and, I presume, no such power is left them by this constitution.

Newspaper,No,A Republican (II),,New York Journal,,12/27/1787,"To the People of the United States. Friends, and Fellow Citizens, As the press has teemed with productions respecting the new constitution, it is to be presumed, that most of you have already formed an opinion, as to its general principles; it is, therefore not my intention to trouble you with any remarks on those parts, which have been discussed; but, to call your attention to a point, which has been entirely unnoticed, and which appears to be sufficiently interesting and important to demand the most serious consideration. It is necessary to premise, that the proposed constitution, if adopted, must be considered, as an original compact, deriving its sanction from the concurrence of the people, totally abolishing the existing federal system, and establishing a government, different in style, construction, and principles:—And as there is no provision made, for continuing in force the acts and ordinances of the present confederation, they, of course, will be abrogated. The convention that formed our state constitution acted upon this principle, when they ordained, that the common and statute laws of England, together with the acts of the colonial legislature, and the resolutions of the convention, should continue to be the law of the state;2 but even if this should be an erroneous position, yet by the dissolution of the present system and its different offices, it is obvious that the acts and ordinances made under it, will become inapplicable and inefficient. Now, as it is declared by the new constitution, that no ex post facto laws shall be passed, will not all responsibility in those, who have been entrusted with the management of our monied concerns, be destroyed by this absolute and unqualified prohibition? Will not all laws, enacted by the general legislature, to oblige delinquents to account for the public treasure in their hands, come under the description of ex post facto laws, and as repugnant to the constitution, be nugatory and void? The 1st paragraph of the 6th article, directs, that [“]all debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of this constitution, shall be as valid against3 the United States, under this constitution as under the confederation.”—It was highly proper to give this security to our national creditors; the provision however, evinces it to have been the sense of the framers of the new constitution, that the acts and ordinances, by which the federal debts were contracted, and engagements entered into, would become void by the establishment of this new government—for, upon this principle only, it could have been deemed necessary. There is something very remarkable in the language of this clause—it provides, that all debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of the constitution, should be valid against the United States.—But there is nothing which ordains, that debts due to the United States, or contracts in their favor, shall be valid—although such a provision, it is evident, was equally essential and necessary. That the secret committees of Congress, who, for a long time, possessed the uncontrouled command of the key of the continental treasury—drew from thence immense sums of money—and that large sums, have also, from time to time, been issued by resolutions of Congress, [475]to the different officers of the various staff departments, are uncontrovertible facts, and that a great proportion of those monies, to the amount of some millions of dollars, remains to this day unaccounted for, cannot be denied, and if it should, I presume a recurrence to the treasury, and other public offices, will establish it beyond the possibility of dispute.4 The people of America are impoverished by a long and ruinous war, borne down with taxes; and it requires their utmost exertions to pay their foreign and domestic debts. In this situation, my fellow citizens, would it be prudent, would it be justifiable, like a neighbouring state, to commence a jubilee, kindle up bonfires, set your bells ringing, and execute a general release to the public debtors5—debtors who have sported away your substance6 in the hour of your distress, and who now wantonly riot on the spoils of your bleeding count[r]y?—it certainly would not. You ought therefore seriously to consider, before you give your fiat to an instrument, which will inevitably annihilate the debts due to the United States. I am sensible, ex post facto laws are generally deemed dangerous and iniquitous—and, in this point of view, their prohibition has been held out, by the advocates of the new constitution, as a lure for its adoption. History, and daily experience however, evince their necessity in some cases, particularly for the purpose of bringing those, concerned in the management of public monies, to justice. It is well worthy of observation, my friends and fellow citizens, that by the new constitution, our most7 inestimable rights, the trial by jury, and the freedom of the press; nay, even the liberty of conscience, are committed to the mercy of the general government, without a single stipulation for their security, and you are told by its advocates, that these important privileges are safely deposited. That the dangers apprehended from their abuse are imaginary and idle—and that from the nature of the government, a bill of rights would have been superfluous and ridiculous. How then are we to reconcile this restriction of power, in the representatives of the people, as to ex post facto laws, with the assertion that all power may be safely entrusted to them. Is it not a solecism in politics, through fear of the abuse of a power, which is in some instances absolutely necessary, totally to prohibit a government from the exercise of it—and yet commit our most important rights (which can never be necessary to promote the public good) into their hand, without the least limitation; you have been informed, in a speech made in favour of the new constitution, by one of its framers, and who (if credit can be given to common fame) took a principal lead in the business, that “it is the nature of man to pursue his own interest in preference to the public good.”8—and as it is well known, that there were gentlemen [476]in the convention of great weight and influence, who have, in divers characters, been most largely concerned in the monied transactions of the United States, and whose accounts remain unsettled,9 is it uncharitable to conclude, that they were influenced by the above sentiment of their friend and colleague, and consequently solicitous to establish a principle which would effectually preclude a settlement of their accounts; and is this not rendered the more probable, by the consideration, that their agents and connections throughout the states, are the warmest advocates, for its precipitate adoption even before the people could have time to understand its principles and reflect upon the resulting consequences. It is, however, immaterial to the public, whether the clause against ex post facto laws, proceeded from corruption or inattention; its effects will be the same.10"
Newspaper,No,Democritus,,New York Journal,,12/28/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, I was until lately a most violent enemy to the new Constitution; I considered it as a damnable design to reduce my countrymen to a state of vassallage; I viewed it with abhorrence and detestation; but my sentiments are totally altered. I now esteem it a perfect production, and will here unfold the reasons for my political regeneration, and hope, they will convert my deluded countrymen from their errors, and render their concurrence universal.—Know then, sir, I once thought Dr. Rushlight’s assertion in the convention of Pennsylvania, that the proposed government descended from heaven,2 little better than blasphemy and impiety; I supposed it was, in other words, saying, that the devil had made a fresh eruption from hell, and became Lord Paramount of the celestial regions. But, when I reflected upon the Doctor’s learning and genius, and upon the rationality of all his remarks, I concluded, that he must have some good reasons for his observation, which he did not think proper to divulge. This subject employed my greatest attention, and the more I revolved it in my mind, the more I was involved in doubt and uncertainty. Until at length, sir, I got happily extricated from the difficulty, and now am convinced of the truth of the Doctor’s position. That some people of Scotland have supernatural and prophetic visions is a fact as true as it is notorious. Might not then Mr. W—n3 have perceived the proposed form of government, by the power of second sight, and have known its excellent tendency to promote the public good, by his prognostic faculty? certainly he might—and, no doubt, this circumstance induced the assent of the Federal Convention, when he recommended it to their adoption.—This hypothesis, I will establish upon uncontrovertible grounds. 1st. Mr. W—n’s conduct demonstrates the reality of his inspiration: he was previously a man of worldly knowledge, and versed in profane studies—but his behavior in the convention of Pennsylvania shews a wonderful change for the better; he speaks of the heathenish Homer and his commentators with contempt, and hints that no plan of a federal government was to be found in his works, though by profession a lawyer; yet he forgets a remarkable passage in Blackstone, about the trial by jury in Sweden4—while he recollects two whole lines in Sternhold and Hopkins’s psalms:5 this behavior evinces, that he neglected and despised his former studies, and betook himself to the perusal of pious and holy books—and, this could never have happened, unless he were under the influence of some extraordinary occurrence. 2d. The unanimity of the federal convention, is infallible evidence of the truth of the Doctor’s position; how is it possible, that thirty-nine men should be unanimous in favor of a government, unless they were convinced of its descention from heaven. 3d. Some priests are strongly in favor of the new constitution, and not only pray, but preach for its adoption; it is conjectured, that some of them have a design to excommunicate the bible, and introduce it as a system of faith—and would it not be a solecism in language to say, that divines prize politics more than divinity? 4th. The infinite perfection of the government demonstrates its heavenly source. After having thus established, with irresistable arguments, an important fact—it behoves me to answer two objections against its certainty. 1st. It may be alledged, if it were true that Mr. W—n was, by inspiration, directed to compose the new constitution, this momentous circumstance would never have been concealed from the people: I answer, that the great modesty of the seer prevented its promulgation—and the ambition of the conventioneers, which stimulated them to arrogate to themselves—a production too perfect for the work of man. 2d. It may be further remarked—that the inspiration of an attorney is extremely improbable, and too miraculous for belief—but, did not Balaam’s ass see the angel of the Lord, and save his master’s life by disobeying him?6 Why then might not Mr. W—n, though an attorney, have a government revealed to him? and by disobeying the instructions of his constituents, he has very probably preserved their liberty and property. So the ass and he acted precisely alike, being both influenced by preternatural causes. O ye people of America, rest satisfied and rejoice—for ye are greatly favored—like the children of Israel—ye are blessed with a government from heaven. In imitation of the Jews, blend physician and priest together [481]in the high-priest; place the great Doctor in the shoes of Aaron, with this single restriction, that he never set up a golden calf for the people to worship.7 Appoint the great attorney seer, generalissimo of the United States, and agree to the celestial constitution. I am conscious, Mr. Greenleaf, that I shall be derided by sceptics, but I despise their derision. I have established my creed upon the rock of truth, and the man who disbelieves it, must be a disciple of Pyrrho.8 DEMOCRITUS. P. S. I hope my good friend Dr. Sawney M’Foolish, the Examiner, will not be angry with me, for employing another physician, to cure me of my madness. I am sure, he must ken vary weele, that I know he is mickle learned in quackery, and of the twa, is the stoutest fighter for the constitution, whilk the convention did tak upon themselves to make. I am glad to see him gie baith the brute and cat a bonny downset. He needna think otherwise, but I was free frae jocularity, when I tauld him, I wud make a set of buiks from his writings, whilk wud shaw him a bennisum to the bairns of Adam; and I donna doubt, but he will be sick mickle thought of in Europe, that he will be mad—a doctor of Medicine, since he has found out so important a thing, that Solomon Gundy9 will throw a man into a fever; and I trust the good people of America, will be grateful, and reward him with the office of man-mid-wife to her sacred majesty, the lady Presidentess, under the new government, for his able performances in defence of it."
Newspaper,No,Twenty-seven Subscribers,,New York Journal,,1/1/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, A number of squeamish ladies, around their breakfast table, last Monday, determined not to read your paper any more—To day a number of gentlemen [(]who subscribe for your paper merely for the variety and to have an opportunity of seeing the arguments as fully as possible on both sides) have expressed as much disgust at you for cramming us with the voluminous PUBLIUS,2 as for disturbing our appetites with your EXAMINER.3 We take M’Lean4 to read Publius in the best edition, and he gives us two at a time; and Childs5 for the daily news and advertisements, but they are curtailed, and we are disappointed for the purpose of serving up the same Publius at our expence; Loudon we take for his morality and evangelic sentiments,6 but here again we are imposed on, by being made to pay for the very same Publius, who has become nauseous, by having been served up to us no less than in two other papers on the same day. And now, Sir, it seems, you have the assurance, notwithstanding your professions, to induce us to subscribe, to give us Publius a fourth time before breakfast, and no less than two at a time. Pray Mr. Greenleaf adhere to the principles and professions you set out on,7 and let us have the wished for variety, or return the money, which you have taken on subscription—do not be so irresolute as to be frightened out of your duty by any pert adventurer, whose principles may be despotic, from habit in the wars and whose ideas of government cannot be satisfied with less than military execution: for a man whose sentiments have been viciated by one profession, will not easily recover virtuous dispositions by another. This new mode of abridging the liberty of the press, in New-York also, is not a [559]favourable symptom; but do not encourage the presumptive attempt of that author to occupy a greater proportion of the public high-way than decently comes to his share. By desire of Twenty-seven Subscribers. Flat-Bush, Dec. 24, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,1/3/1788,"The result of our reasoning in the two preceeding numbers1 is this, that in a confederated government, where the powers are divided between the general and the state government, it is essential to its existence, that the revenues of the country, without which no government can exist, should be divided between them, and so apportioned to each, as to answer their respective exigencies, as far as human wisdom can effect such a division and apportionment. It has been shewn, that no such allotment is made in this constitution, but that every source of revenue is under the controul of the Congress; it therefore follows, that if this system is intended to be a complex and not a simple, a confederate and not an entire consolidated government, it contains in it the sure seeds of its own dissolution.—One of two things must happen—Either the new constitution will become a mere nudum pactum,2 and all the authority of the rulers under it be cried down, as has happened to the present confederation—Or the authority of the individual states will be totally supplanted, and they will retain the mere form without any of the powers of government.—To one or the other of these issues, I think, this new government, if it is adopted, will advance with great celerity. It is said, I know, that such a separation of the sources of revenue, cannot be made without endangering the public safety—“unless (says a writer) it can be shewn that the circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible within certain determinate limits; unless the contrary of this position can be fairly and rationally disputed; it must be admitted as a necessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defence and protection of the community, &c.”(a) The pretended demonstration of this writer will instantly vanish, when it is considered, that the protection and defence of the community is not intended to be entrusted solely into the hands of the general government, and by his own confession it ought not to be. It is true this system commits to the general government the protection and defence of the community against foreign force and invasion, against piracies and felonies on the high seas, and against insurrection among [567]ourselves. They are also authorised to provide for the administration of justice in certain matters of a general concern, and in some that I think are not so. But it ought to be left to the state governments to provide for the protection and defence of the citizen against the hand of private violence, and the wrongs done or attempted by individuals to each other—Protection and defence against the murderer, the robber, the thief, the cheat, and the unjust person, is to be derived from the respective state governments.—The just way of reasoning therefore on this subject is this, the general government is to provide for the protection and defence of the community against foreign attacks, &c. they therefore ought to have authority sufficient to effect this, so far as is consistent with the providing for our internal protection and defence. The state governments are entrusted with the care of administering justice among its citizens, and the management of other internal concerns, they ought therefore to retain power adequate to the end. The preservation of internal peace and good order, and the due administration of law and justice, ought to be the first care of every government.—The happiness of a people depends infinitely more on this than it does upon all that glory and respect which nations acquire by the most brilliant martial achievements—and I believe history will furnish but few examples of nations who have duly attended to these, who have been subdued by foreign invaders. If a proper respect and submission to the laws prevailed over all orders of men in our country; and if a spirit of public and private justice, oeconomy and industry influenced the people, we need not be under any apprehensions but what they would be ready to repel any invasion that might be made on the country. And more than this, I would not wish from them—A defensive war is the only one I think justifiable—I do not make these observations to prove, that a government ought not to be authorised to provide for the protection and defence of a country against external enemies, but to shew that this is not the most important, much less the only object of their care. The European governments are almost all of them framed, and administered with a view to arms, and war, as that in which their chief glory consists; they mistake the end of government—it was designed to save mens lives, not to destroy them. We ought to furnish the world with an example of a great people, who in their civil institutions hold chiefly in view, the attainment of virtue, and happiness among ourselves. Let the monarchs in Europe, share among them the glory of depopulating countries, and butchering thousands of their innocent citizens, to revenge private quarrels, or to punish an insult offered to a wife, a mistress, or a favorite: I envy them not the honor, and I pray heaven this country may never be ambitious of it. The czar Peter the [568]great, acquired great glory by his arms; but all this was nothing, compared with the true glory which he obtained, by civilizing his rude and barbarous subjects, diffusing among them knowledge, and establishing, and cultivating the arts of life: by the former he desolated countries, and drenched the earth with human blood: by the latter he softened the ferocious nature of his people, and pointed them to the means of human happiness. The most important end of government then, is the proper direction of its internal police, and economy; this is the province of the state governments, and it is evident, and is indeed admitted, that these ought to be under their controul. Is it not then preposterous, and in the highest degree absurd, when the state governments are vested with powers so essential to the peace and good order of society, to take from them the means of their own preservation? The idea, that the powers of congress in respect to revenue ought to be unlimited, “because the circumstances which may affect the public safety are not reducible to certain determinate limits,” is novel, as it relates to the government of the united states. The inconveniencies which resulted from the feebleness of the present confederation was discerned, and felt soon after its adoption. It was soon discovered, that a power to require money, without either the authority or means to enforce a collection of it, could not be relied upon either to provide for the common defence, the discharge of the national debt, or for support of government. Congress therefore, so early as February 1781, recommended to the states to invest them with a power to levy an impost of five per cent ad valorem, on all imported goods, as a fund to be appropriated to discharge the debts already contracted, or which should hereafter be contracted for the support of the war, to be continued until the debts should be fully and finally discharged.3 There is not the most distant idea held out in this act, that an unlimited power to collect taxes, duties and excises was necessary to be vested in the united states, and yet this was a time of the most pressing danger and distress. The idea then was, that if certain definite funds were assigned to the union, which were certain in their natures, productive, and easy of collection, it would enable them to answer their engagements, and provide for their defence, and the impost of five per cent was fixed upon for the purpose. This same subject was revived in the winter and spring of 1783, and after a long consideration of the subject, and many schemes were proposed; the result was, a recommendation of the revenue system of April 1783;4 this system does not suggest an idea that it was necessary to grant the United States unlimitted authority in matters of revenue. A variety of amendments were proposed to this system, some of which are upon [569]the journals of Congress, but it does not appear that any of them proposed to invest the general government with discretionary power to raise money. On the contrary, all of them limit them to certain definite objects, and fix the bounds over which they could not pass. This recommendation was passed at the conclusion of the war, and was founded on an estimate of the whole national debt. It was computed, that one million and an half of dollars, in addition to the impost, was a sufficient sum to pay the annual interest of the debt, and gradually to abolish the principal.—Events have proved that their estimate was sufficiently liberal, as the domestic debt appears upon its being adjusted to be less than it was computed, and since this period a considerable portion of the principal of the domestic debt has been discharged by the sale of the western lands. It has been constantly urged by Congress, and by individuals, ever since, until lately, that had this revenue been appropriated by the states, as it was recommended, it would have been adequate to every exigency of the union. Now indeed it is insisted, that all the treasures of the country are to be under the controul of that body, whom we are to appoint to provide for our protection and defence against foreign enemies. The debts of the several states, and the support of the governments of them are to trust to fortune and accident. If the union should not have occasion for all the money they can raise, they will leave a portion for the state, but this must be a matter of mere grace and favor. Doctrines like these would not have been listened to by any state in the union, at a time when we were pressed on every side by a powerful enemy, and were called upon to make greater exertions than we have any reason to expect we shall ever be again. The ability and character of the convention, who framed the proferred constitution, is sounded forth and reiterated by every declaimer and writer in its favor, as a powerful argument to induce its adoption. But are not the patriots who guided our councils in the perilous times of the war, entitled to equal respect. How has it happened, that none of these perceived a truth, which it is pretended is capable of such clear demonstration, that the power to raise a revenue should be deposited in the general government without limitation? Were the men so dull of apprehension, so incapable of reasoning as not to be able to draw the inference? The truth is, no such necessity exists. It is a thing practicable, and by no means so difficult as is pretended, to limit the powers of the general government in respect to revenue, while yet they may retain reasonable means to provide for the common defence. It is admitted, that human wisdom cannot foresee all the variety of circumstances that may arise to endanger the safety of nations—and it may with equal truth be added, that the power of a nation, exerted [570]with its utmost vigour, may not be equal to repel a force with which it may be assailed, much less may it be able, with its ordinary resources and power, to oppose an extraordinary and unexpected attack;—but yet every nation may form a rational judgment, what force will be competent to protect and defend it, against any enemy with which it is probable it may have to contend. In extraordinary attacks, every country must rely upon the spirit and special exertions of its inhabitants—and these extraordinary efforts will always very much depend upon the happiness and good order the people experience from a wise and prudent administration of their internal government. The states are as capable of making a just estimate on this head, as perhaps any nation in the world.—We have no powerful nation in our neighbourhood; if we are to go to war, it must either be with the Aboriginal natives, or with European nations. The first are so unequal to a contest with this whole continent, that they are rather to be dreaded for the depredations they may make on our frontiers, than for any impression they will ever be able to make on the body of the country. Some of the European nations, it is true, have provinces bordering upon us, but from these, unsupported by their European forces, we have nothing to apprehend; if any of them should attack us, they will have to transport their armies across the atlantic, at immense expence, while we should defend ourselves in our own country, which abounds with every necessary of life. For defence against any assault, which there is any probability will be made upon us, we may easily form an estimate. I may be asked to point out the sources, from which the general government could derive a sufficient revenue, to answer the demands of the union. Many might be suggested, and for my part, I am not disposed to be tenacious of my own opinion on the subject. If the object be defined with precision, and will operate to make the burden fall any thing nearly equal on the different parts of the union, I shall be satisfied. There is one source of revenue, which it is agreed, the general government ought to have the sole controul of. This is an impost upon all goods imported from foreign countries. This would, of itself, be very productive, and would be collected with ease and certainty.—It will be a fund too, constantly encreasing—for our commerce will grow, with the productions of the country; and these, together with our consumption of foreign goods, will encrease with our population. It is said, that the impost will not produce a sufficient sum to satisfy the demands of the general government; perhaps it would not. Let some other then, [571]equally well defined, be assigned them:—that this is practicable is certain, because such particular objects were proposed by some members of Congress when the revenue system of April 1783, was agitated in that body. It was then moved, that a tax at the rate of ninetieths of a dollar on surveyed land, and a house tax of half a dollar on a house, should be granted to the United States.5 I do not mention this, because I approve of raising a revenue in this mode. I believe such a tax would be difficult in its collection, and inconvenient in its operation. But it shews, that it has heretofore been the sense of some of those, who now contend, that the general government should have unlimitted authority in matters of revenue, that their authority should be definite and limitted on that head.—My own opinion is, that the objects from which the general government should have authority to raise a revenue, should be of such a nature, that the tax should be raised by simple laws, with few officers, with certainty and expedition, and with the least interference with the internal police of the states.—Of this nature is the impost on imported goods—and it appears to me that a duty on exports, would also be of this nature—and therefore, for ought I can discover, this would be the best source of revenue to grant the general government. I know neither the Congress nor the state legislatures will have authority under the new constitution to raise a revenue in this way. But I cannot perceive the reason of the restriction. It appears to me evident, that a tax on articles exported, would be as nearly equal as any that we can expect to lay, and it certainly would be collected with more ease and less expence than any direct tax. I do not however, contend for this mode, it may be liable to well founded objections that have not occurred to me. But this I do contend for, that some mode is practicable, and that limits must be marked between the general government, and the states on this head, or if they be not, either the Congress in the exercise of this power, will deprive the state legislatures of the means of their existence, or the states by resisting the constitutional authority of the general government, will render it nugatory. (a)Federalist, No. 23.6"
Newspaper,No,Cato,,New York Journal,,1/3/1788,"To the Citizens of the State of New-York. That the senate and president are further improperly connected, will appear, if it is considered, that their dependence on each other will prevent either from being a check upon the other; they must act in concert, and whether the power and influence of the one or the other is to prevail, will depend on the character and abilities of the men who hold those offices at the time. The senate is vested with such a proportion of the executive, that it would be found necessary that they should be constantly sitting. This circumstance did not escape the convention, and they have provided for the event, in the 2d article, which declares, that the executive may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses or either of them. No occasion can exist for calling the assembly without the senate; the words or either of them, must have been intended to apply only to the senate. Their wages are already provided for; and it will be therefore readily observed, that the partition between a perpetuation of their sessions and a perpetuation of their offices, in the progress of the government, will be found to be but thin and feeble. Besides, the senate, who have the sole power to try all impeachments, in case of the impeachment of the president, are to determine, as judges, the propriety of the advice they gave him, as senators. Can the senate in this, therefore, be an impartial judicature? And will they not rather serve as a screen to great public defaulters? Among the many evils that are incorporated in this new system of government, is that of congress having the power of making or altering the regulations prescribed by the different legislatures, respecting the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives, and the time, and manner of choosing senators. If it is enquired, in what manner this regulation may be exercised to your injury—the answer is easy. By the first article the house of representatives shall consist of members, chosen every second year by the people of the several states, who are qualified to vote for members of their several state assemblies; it can therefore readily be believed, that the different state legislatures, provided such can exist after the adoption of this government, will continue those easy and convenient modes for the election of representatives for the national legislature, that are in use, for the election of members of assembly for their own states; but the congress have, by the constitution, a power to make other regulations, or alter those in practice, prescribed by your own state legislatures; hence, instead of [573]having the places of elections in the precincts, and brought home almost to your own doors, Congress may establish a place, or places, at either the extremes, center, or outer parts of the states; at a time and season too, when it may be very inconvenient to attend; and by these means destroy the rights of election; but in opposition to this reasoning, it is asserted, that it is a necessary power because the states might omit making rules for the purpose, and thereby defeat the existence of that branch of the government; this is what logicians call argumentum absurdum,2 for the different states, if they will have any security at all in this government, will find it in the house of representatives, and they, therefore, would not be very ready to eradicate a principle in which it dwells, or involve their country in an instantaneous revolution. Besides, if this was the apprehension of the framers, and the ground of that provision, why did not they extend this controuling power to the other duties of the several state legislatures. To exemplify this the states are to appoint senators, and electors for choosing of a president; but the time is to be under the direction of congress. Now, suppose they were to omit the appointment of senators and electors, though congress was to appoint the time, which might well be apprehended as the omission of regulations for the election of members of the house of representatives, provided they had that power; or suppose they were not to meet at all: of course, the government cannot proceed in its exercise. And from this motive, or apprehension, congress ought to have taken these duties entirely in their own hands, and, by a decisive declaration, annihilated them, which they in fact have done by leaving them without the means of support, or at least resting on their bounty. To this, the advocates for this system oppose the common, empty declamation, that there is no danger that congress will abuse this power; but such language, as relative to so important a subject, is mere vapour and sound without sense. Is it not in their power, however, to make such regulations as may be inconvenient to you? It must be admitted, because the words are unlimited in their sense. It is a good rule, in the construction of a contract, to suppose, that what may be done will be; therefore, in considering this subject, you are to suppose, that in the exercise of this government, a regulation of congress will be made, for holding an election for the whole state at Poughkeepsie, at New-York, or, perhaps, at Fort-Stanwix: who will then be the actual electors for the house of representatives? Very few more than those who may live in the vicinity of these places. Could any others afford the expence and time of attending? And would not the government by this means have it in their power to put whom they pleased in the house of representatives? You ought certainly to have as much or more distrust with respect to the [574]exercise of these powers by congress, than congress ought to have with respect to the exercise of those duties which ought to be entrusted to the several states, because over them congress can have a legislative controuling power. Hitherto we have tied up our rulers in the exercise of their duties by positive restrictions—if the cord has been drawn too tight, loosen it to the necessary extent, but do not entirely unbind them.—I am no enemy to placing a reasonable confidence in them; but such an unbounded one as the advocates and framers of this new system advise you to, would be dangerous to your liberties; it has been the ruin of other governments, and will be yours, if you adopt with all its latitudinal powers—unlimitted confidence in governors as well as individuals is frequently the parent of deception.—What facilitated the corrupt designs of Philip of Macedon, and caused the ruin of Athens, but the unbounded confidence in their statesmen and rulers? Such improper confidence Demosthenes was so well convinced had ruined his country, that in his second Phillipic oration he remarks—“that there is one common bulwark with which men of prudence are naturally provided, the guard and security of all people, particularly of free states, against the assaults of tyrants—What is this? Distrust. Of this be mindful; to this adhere; preserve this carefully, and no calamity can affect you.”3—Montesquieu observes, that “the course of government is attended with an insensible descent to evil, and there is no reascending to good without very great efforts.”4 The plain inference from this doctrine is, that rulers in all governments will erect an interest separate from the ruled, which will have a tendency to enslave them. There is therefore no other way of interrupting this insensible descent and warding off the evil as long as possible, than by establishing principles of distrust in your constituents, and cultivating the sentiment among yourselves. But let me enquire of you, my countrymen, whether the freedom and independence of elections is a point of magnitude? If it is, what kind of a spirit of amity, deference and concession,5 is that which has put it in the power of Congress at one stroke to prevent your interference in government, and do away your liberties for ever? Does either the situation or circumstances of things warrant it?"
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,Publius,1/7/1788,"A correspondent, having observed the attempt of the present voluminous writer upon the new constitution, to explain the meaning of its several abstruce parts, by mathematical demonstration, and his endeavours to prove its right angular construction, begs leave to propose, since he has failed in this mode, that he next have recourse to conic sections, by which he will be enabled, with greater facility, to discover the mazy windings of his favorite system."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,1/7/1788,"By private accounts from Boston, we learn, that almost all the stanch republicans of Massachusetts, those begetters and supporters of the late revolution, who are lovers of the community at large, and defenders of their freedom and independence, consequently detesters of every tyrannical junto, and their abettors, are decidedly opposed to the proposed constitution in its present form; among these are, that father of patriots SAMUEL ADAMS,2 and a number of the other members of the [578]ever memoriable COMMITTEE of CORRESPONDENTS, of 1774, ’5, and 6."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,1/10/1788,"The next powers vested by this constitution in the general government, which we shall consider, are those, which authorise them to “borrow money on the credit of the United States, and to raise and support armies.” I take these two together and connect them with the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, because their extent, [594]and the danger that will arise from the exercise of these powers, cannot be fully understood, unless they are viewed in relation to each other. The power to borrow money is general and unlimitted, and the clause so often before referred to, authorises the passing any laws proper and necessary to carry this into execution. Under this authority, the Congress may mortgage any or all the revenues of the union, as a fund to loan money upon, and it is probable, in this way, they may borrow of foreign nations, a principal sum, the interest of which will be equal to the annual revenues of the country.—By this means, they may create a national debt, so large, as to exceed the ability of the country ever to sink. I can scarcely contemplate a greater calamity that could befal this country, than to be loaded with a debt exceeding their ability ever to discharge. If this be a just remark, it is unwise and improvident to vest in the general government, a power to borrow at discretion, without any limitation or restriction. It may possibly happen that the safety and welfare of the country may require, that money be borrowed, and it is proper when such a necessity arises that the power should be exercised by the general government.—But it certainly ought never to be exercised, but on the most urgent occasions, and then we should not borrow of foreigners if we could possibly avoid it. The constitution should therefore have so restricted, the exercise of this power as to have rendered it very difficult for the government to practise it. The present confederation requires the assent of nine states to exercise this, and a number of the other important powers of the confederacy2—and it would certainly have been a wise provision in this constitution, to have made it necessary that two thirds of the members should assent to borrowing money—when the necessity was indispensible, this assent would always be given, and in no other cause ought it to be. The power to raise armies, is indefinite and unlimitted, and authorises the raising forces, as well in peace as in war. Whether the clause which impowers the Congress to pass all laws which are proper and necessary, to carry this into execution, will not authorise them to impress men for the army, is a question well worthy consideration? If the general legislature deem it for the general welfare to raise a body of troops, and they cannot be procured by voluntary enlistments, it seems evident, that it will be proper and necessary to effect it, that men be impressed from the militia to make up the deficiency. These powers taken in connection, amount [to] this: that the general government have unlimitted authority and controul over all the wealth [595]and all the force of the union. The advocates for this scheme, would favor the world with a new discovery, if they would shew, what kind of freedom or independency is left to the state governments, when they cannot command any part of the property or of the force of the country, but at the will of the Congress. It seems to me as absurd, as it would be to say, that I was free and independent, when I had conveyed all my property to another, and was tenant to will to him, and had beside, given an indenture of myself to serve him during life.—The power to keep up standing armies in time of peace, has been justly objected, to this system, as dangerous and improvident. The advocates who have wrote in its favor, have some of them ridiculed the objection, as though it originated in the distempered brain of its opponents, and others have taken pains to shew, that it is a power that was proper to be granted to the rulers in this constitution. That you may be enabled to form a just opinion on this subject, I shall first make some remarks, tending to prove, that this power ought to be restricted, and then animadvert on the arguments which have been adduced to justify it. I take it for granted, as an axiom in politic, that the people should never authorise their rulers to do any thing, which if done, would operate to their injury. It seems equally clear, that in a case where a power, if given and exercised, will generally produce evil to the community, and seldom good—and which, experience has proved, has most frequently been exercised to the great injury, and very often to the total destruction of the government; in such a case, I say, this power, if given at all, should if possible be so restricted, as to prevent the ill effect of its operation. Let us then enquire, whether standing armies in time of peace, would be ever beneficial to our country—or if in some extraordinary cases, they might be necessary; whether it is not true, that they have generally proved a scourge to a country, and destructive of their liberty. I shall not take up much of your time in proving a point, in which the friends of liberty, in all countries, have so universally agreed. The following extract from Mr. Pultney’s speech, delivered in the house of commons of Great-Britain, on a motion for reducing the army, is so full to the point, and so much better than any thing I can say, that I shall be excused for inserting it.3 He says, “I have always been, and always shall be against a standing army of any kind; to me it is a terrible thing, whether under that of a parliamentary, or any other designation; a standing army is still a standing army by whatever name it is called; they are a body of men distinct from the body of the people; they are governed by different laws, and blind obedience, and an entire submission to the orders of their commanding officer, is their only principle; [596]the nations around us, sir, are already enslaved, and have been enslaved by those very means; by means of their standing armies they have every one lost their liberties; it is indeed impossible that the liberties of the people in any country can be preserved where a numerous standing army is kept up. Shall we then take our measures from the example of our neighbours? No, sir, on the contrary, from their misfortunes we ought to learn to avoid those rocks upon which they have split. “It signifies nothing to tell me that our army is commanded by such gentlemen as cannot be supposed to join in any measures for enslaving their country; it may be so; I have a very good opinion of many gentlemen now in the army; I believe they would not join in any such measures; but their lives are uncertain, nor can we be sure how long they will be kept in command, they may all be dismissed in a moment, and proper tools of power put in their room. Besides, sir, we know the passions of men, we know how dangerous it is to trust the best of men with too much power. Where was a braver army than that under Jul. Caesar? Where was there ever an army that had served their country more faithfully? That army was commanded generally by the best citizens of Rome, by men of great fortune and figure in their country, yet that army enslaved their country. The affections of the soldiers towards their country, the honor and integrity of the under officers, are not to be depended on. By the military law the administration of justice is so quick, and the punishments so severe, that neither the officer nor soldier dare dispute the orders of his supreme commander; he must not consult his own inclination. If an officer were commanded to pull his own father out of his house, he must do it; he dares not disobey; immediate death would be the sure consequence of the least grumbling: and if an officer were sent into the court of request, accompanied by a body of musketeers with screwed bayonets, and with orders to tell us what we ought to do, and how we were to vote: I know what would be the duty of this house; I know it would be our duty to order the officer to be hanged at the door of the lobby: but I doubt, sir, I doubt much, if such a spirit could be found in the house, or in any house of commons that will ever be in England.  “Sir, I talk not of imaginary things? I talk of what has happened to an English house of commons, from an English army; not only from an English army, but an army that was raised by that very house of commons, an army that was paid by them, and an army that was commanded by generals appointed by them; therefore do not let us vainly imagine, that an army, raised and maintained by authority of parliament, will always be submissive to them.4 If an army be so numerous [597]as to have it in their power to overawe the parliament, they will be submissive as long as the parliament does nothing to disoblige their favourite general; but when that case happens I am afraid, that in place of the parliament’s dismissing the army, the army will dismiss the parliament.”—If this great man’s reasoning be just, it follows, that keeping up a standing army, would be the highest degree dangerous to the liberty and happiness of the community—and if so, the general government ought not to have authority to do it; for no government should be empowered to do that which if done, would tend to destroy public liberty."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (II),,New York Journal,,1/10/1788,"Worthy Sir, Since I wrote to you last,2 I have been giving the new constitution another reading, though, in truth, I got almost sick of it; and, I find by one clause, which I had not taken so much notice of before, that all laws, treaties, &c. made by this new government, is to be the supreme law of the land, the state constitutions, or any of their laws, to the contrary notwithstanding;—now besides, the powers it takes away, in so many words, from our state governments, and to be sure it takes so much, as to leave them, in my poor opinion, very little; its laws and treaties may take away more, and so alter and change what little is left, that no body among us, except the lawyers, will be able to know any thing about our own state constitution and laws—and, I do not believe, they themselves will understand them; I will warrant you, they will not like it the worse for that, for they will always give it such a meaning, as will best suit their own purposes. I find too, that all our state officers are to take an oath or affirmation to support this new constitution—now as they are bound by an oath to support our state constitution too—and as it is almost impossible to find out the meaning of the new constitution, and how much power would be taken away from the state governments in the first place, and altogether uncertain how much more may hereafter be taken away by laws and treaties which [598]may be made under the new government, I cannot, for my share, see how an honest man will be able ever to take such an oath; for one day he may be bound by oath to observe a law made by his own government, and the next day out comes a law or treaty from the general government, by which he is obliged by oath to do the contrary; and if he doubts the right of the general government to make such a law or treaty, to be sure, he will be in a very disagreeable situation. Indeed, my good sir, it is a serious thing to trifle with an oath; and, I think, they ought to have mentioned clearly and plainly, how much power they meant to give to the new government, and how much they meant to leave with the states, before they required oaths of people; and, I believe, it is very certain, that if this general government takes place, they will never get an honest man to serve in either;—for no man but he that has a conscience that will stretch like a tripe, will swear to perform a duty that he cant understand. I observe, that, by the new constitution, they have guarranteed to the respective states a republican form of government—now I conclude this was, because it was thought the best form and most pleasing to the people; but I cannot find, at the same time, that they have made any engagements, that this new government shall continue to be republican; and I see, they have contrived a way to change it into what they please, without giving themselves the trouble to consult the people about it: as they have taken away almost all powers from the state governments, I think this guarrantee to them of a republican form of government will be of very little use, for what good can the mere form or shadow do, when the substance is lost? Indeed, worthy sir, according to my weak judgment, this new constitution is a very bad one, and if ever it should be agreed to, I am afraid we shall have reason to rue it. It appears very strange to me, that some people who were lately fighting for liberty, should so soon turn tail, and now endeavour to establish a tyranny over their country: and I think, it is not uncharitable to conclude, that instead of contending with the old government for the sake of liberty, they were contending for power—which, no doubt, they will have plenty of, when the new constitution takes place: however, I hope, they will be disappointed, for I can assure you, there is not a man in our parts, but what thinks of it exactly as I do, and is determined at all hazards, to have nothing to do with it; for it would be vain and foolish, indeed, to spend so much blood and treasure to rid ourselves of one tyranny and set up a worse. I am greatly indebted to you, for putting yourself to the trouble of sending me so many papers about this matter—and as they must be attended with some expence to you, I beg you will send me no more [599]of them; for I have seen enough to convince me very fully, that the new constitution is a very bad one, and a hundred-fold worse than our present government; and I do not perceive, that any of the writers in favour of it (although some of them use a vast many fine words, and shew a great deal of learning) are able to remove any of the objections which are made against it. Mr. Wilson, indeed, speaks very highly of it; but we have only his word for its goodness; and nothing is more natural than for a mother to speak well of her own bantling, however ordinary it may be. He seems, however, to be pretty honest in one thing—where he says, “It is the nature of man to pursue his own interest, in preference to the public good”3—for they tell me he is a lawyer, and his interest then makes him for the new government, for it will be a noble thing for lawyers; besides, he appears to have an eye to some high place under it, since he speaks with great pleasure of the places of honour and emolument, being diverted to a new channel, by this change of system. As to Mr. Publius, I have read a great many of his papers, and I really cannot find out what he would be at; he seems to me as if he was going to write a history, so I have concluded to wait and buy one of his books, when they come out.4 The only thing I can understand from him, as far as I have read, is, that it is better to be united than divided—that a great many people are stronger than a few—and that Scotland is better off since the union with England than before; and I think, he proves too, very clearly, that the fewer nations there are in the world, the fewer disputes will be about the law of nations—and the greater number that are joined in one government, the abler will they be to raise ships and soldiers, and the less need for fighting; but I do not learn that any body denies these matters, or that they have any thing to do with the new constitution. Indeed I am at a loss to know, whether Mr. Publius means to persuade us to return back to the old government, and make ourselves as happy as Scotland has by its union, or to accept of the new constitution, and get all the world to join with us, so as to make one large government—it would certainly, if what he says is true, be very convenient for Nova-Scotia and Canada, and, for ought I know, his advice will have great weight with them, I have also read several other of the pieces, which appear to be wrote by some other little authors, and by people of little consequence, though they seem to think themselves men of importance, and take upon them grand names, such as Curtius, Cæsar,5 and the like. Now Mr. Cæsar6 do not depend so much on reasoning as upon bullying—he abuses the people very much, and if he spoke in our neighbourhood as impudently as he writes in the newspapers, I question whether he would come off with whole bones: from the manner he talks of the people, [600]he certainly cannot be one of them himself; I imagine he has lately come over from some old country, where they are all Lords and no common people—if so, it would be as well for him to go back again, as to meddle himself with our business, since he holds such a bad opinion of us. I have already gave you a great deal of trouble, honoured Sir, with my long letters—I shall therefore conclude, hoping if any thing new is stiring, that you would be kind enough, now and then, to drop me a line, and let me know how things are going in your city. I remain with great respect, Your assured friend and Humble servant, A COUNTRYMAN."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,1/17/1788,"The design of civil government is to protect the rights and promote the happiness of the people. For this end, rulers are invested with powers. But we cannot from hence justly infer that these powers should be unlimited. There are certain rights which mankind possess, over which government ought not to have any controul, because it is not necessary they should, in order to attain the end of its institution. There are certain things which rulers should be absolutely prohibited from doing, because, if they should do them, they would work an injury, not a benefit to the people. Upon the same principles of reasoning, if the exercise of a power, is found generally or in most cases to operate to the injury of the community, the legislature should be restricted in the exercise of that power, so as to guard, as much as possible, against the danger. These principles seem to be the evident dictates of common sense, and what ought to give sanction to them in the minds of every American, they are the great principles of the late revolution, and those which governed [618]the framers of all our state constitutions. Hence we find, that all the state constitutions, contain either formal bills of rights, which set bounds to the powers of the legislature, or have restrictions for the same purpose in the body of the constitutions. Some of our new political Doctors, indeed, reject the idea of the necessity, or propriety of such restrictions in any elective government, but especially in the general one. But it is evident, that the framers of this new system were of a contrary opinion, because they have prohibited the general government, the exercise of some powers, and restricted them in that of others. I shall adduce two instances, which will serve to illustrate my meaning, as well as to confirm the truth of the preceding remark. In the 9th section, it is declared, “no bill of attainder shall be passed.” This clause takes from the legislature all power to declare a particular person guilty of a crime by law. It is proper the legislature should be deprived of the exercise of this power, because it seldom is exercised to the benefit of the community, but generally to its injury. In the same section it is provided, that “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion, the public safety may require it.” This clause limits the power of the legislature to deprive a citizen of the right of habeas corpus, to particular cases viz. those of rebellion and invasion; the reason is plain, because in no other cases can this power be exercised for the general good. Let us apply these remarks to the case of standing armies in times of peace. If they generally prove the destruction of the happiness and liberty of the people, the legislature ought not to have power to keep them up, or if they had, this power should be so restricted, as to secure the people against the danger arising from the exercise of it. That standing armies are dangerous to the liberties of a people was proved in my last number2—If it was necessary, the truth of the position might be confirmed by the history of almost every nation in the world. A cloud of the most illustrious patriots of every age and country, where freedom has been enjoyed, might be adduced as witnesses in support of the sentiment. But I presume it would be useless, to enter into a laboured argument, to prove to the people of America, a position, which has so long and so generally been received by them as a kind of axiom. Some of the advocates for this new system controvert this sentiment, as they do almost every other that has been maintained by the best writers on free government.—Others, though they will not expressly deny, that standing armies in times of peace are dangerous, yet join [619]with these in maintaining, that it is proper the general government should be vested with the power to do it. I shall now proceed to examine the arguments they adduce in support of their opinions. A writer, in favor of this system, treats this objection as a ridiculous one. He supposes it would be as proper to provide against the introduction of Turkish janizaries, or against making the Alcoran a rule of faith.3 From the positive, and dogmatic manner, in which this author delivers his opinions, and answers objections made to his sentiments—one would conclude, that he was some pedantic pedagogue who had been accustomed to deliver his dogmas to pupils, who always placed implicit faith in what he delivered.4 But, why is this provision so ridiculous? because, says this author, it is unnecessary. But, why is it unnecessary? “because, the principles and habits, as well as the power of the Americans are directly opposed to standing armies; and there is as little necessity to guard against them by positive constitutions, as to prohibit the establishment of the Mahometan religion.” It is admitted then, that a standing army in time of peace, is an evil. I ask then, why should this government be authorised to do evil? If the principles and habits of the people of this country are opposed to standing armies in time of peace, if they do not contribute to the public good, but would endanger the public liberty and happiness, why should the government be vested with the power? No reason can be given, why rulers should be authorised to do, what, if done, would oppose the principles and habits of the people, and endanger the public safety, but there is every reason in the world, that they should be prohibited from the exercise of such a power. But this author supposes, that no danger is to be apprehended from the exercise of this power, because, if armies are kept up, it will be by the people themselves, and therefore, to provide against it, would be as absurd as for a man to “pass a law in his family, that no troops should be quartered in his family by his consent.” This reasoning supposes, that the general government is to be exercised by the people of America themselves—But such an idea is groundless and absurd. There is surely a distinction between the people and their rulers, even when the latter are representatives of the former.—They certainly are not identically the same, and it cannot be disputed, but it may and often does happen, that they do not possess the same sentiments or pursue the same interests. I think I have shewn, that as this government is constituted, there is little reason to expect, that the interest of the people and their rulers will be the same. Besides, if the habits and sentiments of the people of America are [620]to be relied upon, as the sole security against the encroachment of their rulers, all restrictions in constitutions are unnecessary; nothing more is requisite, than to declare who shall be authorized to exercise the powers of government, and about this we need not be very careful—for the habits and principles of the people will oppose every abuse of power. This I suppose to be the sentiments of this author, as it seems to be of many of the advocates of this new system. An opinion like this, is as directly opposed to the principles and habits of the people of America, as it is to the sentiments of every writer of reputation on the science of government, and repugnant to the principles of reason and common sense. The idea that there is no danger of the establishment of a standing army, under the new constitution, is without foundation. It is a well known fact, that a number of those who had an agency in producing this system, and many of those who it is probable will have a principal share in the administration of the government under it, if it is adopted, are avowedly in favour of standing armies. It is a language common among them, “That no people can be kept in order, unless the government have an army to awe them into obedience; it is necessary to support the dignity of government, to have a military establishment.” And there will not be wanting a variety of plausible reason[s] to justify the raising one, drawn from the danger we are in from the Indians on our frontiers, or from the European provinces in our neighbourhood. If to this we add, that an army will afford a decent support, and agreeable employment to the young men of many families, who are too indolent to follow occupations that will require care and industry, and too poor to live without doing any business we can have little reason to doubt, but that we shall have a large standing army, as soon as this government can find money to pay them, and perhaps sooner. A writer, who is the boast of the advocates of this new constitution, has taken great pains to shew, that this power was proper and necessary to be vested in the general government.5 He sets out with calling in question the candour and integrity of those who advance the objection, and with insinuating, that it is their intention to mislead the people, by alarming their passions, rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their understandings. The man who reproves another for a fault, should be careful that he himself be not guilty of it. How far this writer has manifested a spirit of candour, and has pursued fair reasoning on this subject, the impartial public will judge, when his arguments pass before them in review. He first attempts to shew, that this objection is futile and disingenuous, [621]because the power to keep up standing armies, in time of peace, is vested, under the present government, in the legislature of every state in the union, except two. Now this is so far from being true, that it is expressly declared, by the present articles of confederation, that no body of forces “shall be kept up by any state, in time of peace, except such number only, as in the judgment of the United States in Congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison the forts necessary for the defence of such state.”6 Now, was it candid and ingenuous to endeavour to persuade the public, that the general government had no other power than your own legislature have on this head; when the truth is, your legislature have no authority to raise and keep up any forces? He next tells us, that the power given by this constitution, on this head, is similar to that which Congress possess under the present confederation. As little ingenuity is manifested in this representation as in that of the former. I shall not undertake to enquire whether or not Congress are vested with a power to keep up a standing army in time of peace; it has been a subject warmly debated in Congress, more than once, since the peace;7 and one of the most respectable states in the union, were so fully convinced that they had no such power, that they expressly instructed their delegates to enter a solemn protest against it on the journals of Congress, should they attempt to exercise it.8 But should it be admitted that they have the power, there is such a striking dissimilarity between the restrictions under which the present Congress can exercise it, and that of the proposed government, that the comparison will serve rather to shew the impropriety of vesting the proposed government with the power, than of justifying it. It is acknowledged by this writer, that the powers of Congress, under the present confederation, amount to little more than that of recommending. If they determine to raise troops, they are obliged to effect it through the authority of the state legislatures. This will, in the first instance, be a most powerful restraint upon them, against ordering troops to be raised. But if they should vote an army, contrary to the opinion and wishes of the people, the legislatures of the respective states would not raise them. Besides, the present Congress hold their places at the will and pleasure of the legislatures of the states who send them, and no troops can be raised, but by the assent of nine states out of the thirteen. Compare the power proposed to be lodged in the legislature on this head, under this constitution, with that vested in the present Congress,9 and every person of the least discernment, whose understanding is not totally blinded by prejudice, will perceive, that [622]they bear no analogy to each other. Under the present confederation, the representatives of nine states, out of thirteen, must assent to the raising of troops, or they cannot be levied: under the proposed constitution, a less number than the representatives of two states, in the house of representatives, and the representatives of three states and an half in the senate, with the assent of the president, may raise any number of troops they please. The present Congress are restrained from an undue exercise of this power, from this consideration, they know the state legislatures, through whose authority it must be carried into effect, would not comply with the requisition for the purpose, if it was evidently opposed to the public good: the proposed constitution authorizes the legislature to carry their determinations into execution, without the intervention of any other body between them and the people. The Congress under the present form are amenable to, and removable by, the legislatures of the respective states, and are chosen for one year only: the proposed constitution does not make the members of the legislature accountable to, or removeable by the state legislatures at all; and they are chosen, the one house for six, and the other for two years; and cannot be removed until their time of service is expired, let them conduct ever so badly.—The public will judge, from the above comparison, how just a claim this writer has to that candour he affects to possess. In the mean time, to convince him, and the advocates for this system, that I possess some share of candor, I pledge myself to give up all opposition to it, on the head of standing armies, if the power to raise them be restricted as it is in the present confederation; and I believe I may safely answer, not only for myself, but for all who make the objection, that they will be satisfied with less."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (II),,New York Journal,,1/17/1788,"Worthy Sir, I might have saved myself a world of trouble, in searching to find out the meaning of the new constitution, if I had only attended a little more closely at first, to that clause, which says, the Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States—and the other clause, which gives them power to make all laws, that shall be necessary and proper, for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers, vested by this constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department, or officer thereof. The first gives them power to do any thing at all, if they only please to say, it is for the common welfare, for they are the only judges of this—and, my neighbour is clearly of opinion, that they have power, under these clauses, even to ring and yoke all the hogs in the country; and a great many people, who have much meadow-lands, and who have them often rooted up and spoiled by the swine, think it would be for the general welfare; for they suppose, in this way, and in their corn-fields, if it was all reckoned up, they do more damage than they are worth, when they are fit for the knife—so, if this is the case, it would certainly be for the general welfare, not to let them run at large at all. By the last of these clauses, it would appear, that there are some powers vested in this government, besides what are mentioned in it, since it speaks of the aforegoing, and all other powers: now I do not think it worth while to waste any time, in finding out what these other powers are, for those which are mentioned, will take in every thing, but the two or three little matters, they have accepted [i.e., excepted]. As I said before, though I did not like the whole constitution, I was pleased to find that this new government would be prevented [624]from making lords, and ex post facto laws; but I begin to doubt, whether these things were not put in on purpose to shew, they would have had authority to do them, if they had not accepted [i.e., excepted] them—and to confirm more strongly their power of doing every thing else; howsomever, my old neighbour from Pennsylvania tells me, that this ex post facto law business was put in, not because it was a bad thing, but to place it out of our power of calling to account, people who have the public monies in their hands—for, by this means, there will be no such thing as getting at them, and indeed I think it is very likely, that this may be the case, for if they were really honest, and meant to hinder the doing of a bad thing, why did they not also say, that the Congress should never take away, the rights of conscience, trial by jury, and liberty of the press? These are all rights we hold very dear, and yet we have often read, and heard of governments, under various pretences, breaking in upon them—and upon the rights of conscience particularly; for in most of the old countries, their rulers, it seems, have thought it for the general welfare to establish particular forms of religion, and make every body worship God in a certain way, whether the people thought it right or no, and punish them severely, if they would not: now, as it is known, that there has been a great deal of mischief done by rulers in these particulars, and as I have never read or heard of any great mischief being done by ex post facto laws, surely it would have been of more importance, to have provided against Congress, making laws to take away liberty of conscience, trial by jury, and freedom of the press, than against their passing ex post facto laws, or even their making lords. I conclude therefore, that there may be a great deal of truth, in what my neighbour from Pennsylvania says, about this matter. By this new constitution, there are several things, which it is declared the state governments shall not do, such as emitting bills of credit, making any thing but gold or silver coin a tender in payment of debts, and passing laws for the impairing the obligation of contracts, &c.—but I do not find, that this new government are hindered from doing these things, and yet if they are bad things, it appears proper, that they ought to be hindered from doing them, as well as the state governments—for I do not see, why we are to expect honester men in the general government, than in the state governments; there will be a great many there, that we never heard of or know any thing about; and I am sure we have suffered more by the paper money made by Congress than we have by that made by our own assembly. Indeed, Worthy Sir, take the new constitution all together, it is an odd jumbled kind of business, and yet some people say, they were very wise, honest men, who made it—though I have no doubt some of them might have been [625]very honest, but I am widely mistaken, if the bulk of them were both honest and wise. I am, Honored Sir, Your real friend, and Humble servant, A COUNTRYMAN."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,1/22/1788,"Letters from a Gentleman in Dutchess-County, to his Friend in New-York. (Continued from this Register of the 15th ult.)2 January 10, 1788. Dear Sir, Although an unavoidable impediment has prevented my corresponding with you, as often as I wished and intended, yet it has not, entirely, deprived me of all opportunity, of revolving the general convention and their proceedings in my mind. In doing which, I always endeavour to divest myself of every prepossession for, or against them, and their conduct, and, as impartially and candidly as I am capable, to view and consider the whole in every possible point of light, in which I can place it.—And, though it is readily granted, that the convention was composed of a number of very sensible men; yet, if we take the retrospect of the time, when it was first proposed, that there should be a general convention, and the design of it; and likewise reflect, that several of the gentlemen who composed the last convention, were also members of the first, as well as members of the different legislatures which deputed them, besides being delegates to Congress; by all which means they must have had frequent, and great opportunities of learning the sentiments of others with time to read and study the best authors on government, and make up their own minds, on the subject, previous to their last meeting. Shall we find, if we deduct a part of the constitution of this state, some part of the confederation, and the mode of election in Connecticut, &c. from what they have done, that all these combined circumstances, added to four months close application of great abilities and wisdom, which have been so often bandied about, have produced any thing adequate to what might reasonably have been expected from such united advantages?—Nay, have they produced any thing but what they ought not to have produced? And, to say no worse of it, have they not descended below the dignity of their characters? Have they not said,—“Done in convention, by the unanimous consent of the states present, &c.” shortly after which, we see, “New-York,” and “Alexander Hamilton,” annexed to it, as though the state were fully represented by that one deputy, when it had sent three deputies?—And, either forgetting, or in hopes that others would forget, have they not afterwards said, “In convention, Monday September 17, 1787. Present, the states of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut,” “Mr. Hamilton for New-York, &c.?” By what name ought this to be called? May not some of the wisdom of this world be truly called foolishness? [635]I could very easily imagine, that a gentleman of far less understanding than “Alexander Hamilton,” is said to be, would have had modesty enough to wait for further authority, before he set his name to an instrument of such immense importance to the state which entrusted him, and honored him with its interests and commands.3 What was this but setting the state and his colleagues at open defiance, and, tacitly, telling the legislature and them, “I want none of your instructions, advice, nor assistance. I better know than you or they what ought to be done, and how to do it. Yes, I know what will suit you all, much better than any body else in the state. I know, that trial by jury, of the vicinage, is a foolish custom, besides frequently embarrassing the judges, it often disappoints the lawyers, and therefore, as I may never have it in my power again, I will now contribute all I can to the abolition of it.” If it be true, that actions may speak plainer than words, which, I believe, is a maxim pretty well established, must not the foregoing, or something like it, have been the language or ideas held by that gentleman? Can the conduct of a man be spoken too freely of, who, unauthorised, has attempted to transfer all power from the many, to the few? Has this state, or, have the United States, expended so much blood and treasure for the sake of exalting one, or the few, and depressing the many? If they have, or, if that was their view, then have they been guilty of an unpardonable offence against God and their country. But it cannot be—that never could have been even in contemplation, with the honest patriots of seventy-six. The conduct of George Grenville, the Earl of Hillsborough, Lord Mansfield, the Earl of Bute, Lord North, the King and Parliament of Great Britain, as well as that of their adherents, the stamp-masters, &c. in America, has always been canvassed and treated with the utmost freedom, by the friends of this country. Whence then all this reserve and tenderness for a junto of our fellow citizens, who have cast off their allegiance to the United States, and endeavoured to rob us of our best inheritance? Will it not be said, by the nations of Europe and posterity, that they acted with more spirit and enterprise in robbing us of it, than we have in defending it, though we pretended to know the value of it? Others may do as they please, but, for myself, I am determined to pursue them, with my pen, as long as I can wield it, unless they should make a solemn, public recantation. Should the new constitution be sufficiently corrected by a substantial bill of rights, an equitable representation, chosen annually, or not eligible under two years, the senate chosen triennally, and not eligible in [636]less than three years afterwards, which, apart from it, becoming a more general object to men of learning and genius, might also be a means of preventing monopolies by a few men or families—separating the legislative, judicial and executive departments entirely, and confining the national government to its proper objects; but, by no means admitting a standing army in time of peace, nor a select militia, which last, is a scheme that a certain head4 has, for some time, been teeming with, and is nothing else but an artful introduction to the other—Nor ought the militia, or any part of it, I think, to be marched out of the state, without the consent of the legislature, and then, not for more than a certain reasonable time, &c.—leaving the states sovereign and independent with respect to their internal police, and relinquishing every idea of drenching the bowels of Africa in gore, for the sake of enslaving its freeborn innocent inhabitants, I imagine we might become a happy and respectable people. And, the conduct of the late general convention, by the violent effort which it has made to prostrate our invaluable liberties at the feet of power, fully evinces the absolute necessity of the most express stipulations, for all our essential rights. But, should the constitution be adopted in its present form, without any amendment, I candidly think, that we should have been much happier, at least for a number of years, in our old connexion with Great-Britain, than with such an absurd heterogeneal kind of government as the convention have proposed for our implicit adoption. Indeed, at present, there are so many dissentients, and others daily becoming so, in all the states, and with arms in their hands, that I cannot see how it could well be organized, without a force superior to every opposition, and that must, of course, absorb all the resources of ways and means immediately, and would defeat many of its own purposes and promises. Besides, where is the difference between the people’s cutting one another’s throats, for their own diversion, or cutting them for the pleasure and aggrandizement of one or a few?—If any, I should prefer the former; that is, for my own diversion, &c. I have no idea of being gladiator to any man or body of men whatever; nor marching 500 or 1000 miles to quell an insurrection of such emigrants as are proposed by the new constitution, to be introduced for one and twenty years. No, nor of butchering the natives, that a few great speculators and landholders may engross all the best soil for a song, and revive the old feudal system, which I know to be the wish of some of the advocates for the new government. Is it not fortunate for this state, that the executive is not one of the aristocracy, or we might have been precipitated into measures, perhaps, which would have afforded us ample time for repentance? [637] If, at any time, I should trespass on your patience, I beg you will please to place it to the account of the general convention, and believe me to be, dear Sir, Your most obedient and very humble servant, A COUNTRYMAN."
Letter,No,Melancton Smith,Abraham Yates Jr.,,,1/23/1788,"I have been so engaged for a long time past that I have not been able to command leisure to write to you—Indeed for sometime past, there would have been no propriety in my writing, for report here said that you was defunct, and that your funeral had been solemnized with great pomp & your pall supported by a number of illustrious Characters, who I am well informed had a principal agency in producing the new Constitution2—What should have taken them, so soon from Philadelphia to Albany, I was at a loss to determine, unless it was for the benefit of the air, or to make an establishment at the City of Lansingburgh, which I am told is a favourable situation to carry on their business— I am happy to hear, however that you are now in the land of the living—If the report of your decease was true, and you have been restored to this mortal life by a dissmission from the regions of the dead, for a while in order to oppose the new system of government, I should be curious to hear what a number of the patriots who assisted in effecting the late revolution say about it?—But perhaps, the publication concerng your death, meant to take a distinction between the rough Hewer and Abraham Yates, so that though the former might be buried, the latter might remain in Life and health— I cannot give you any news of importance to be relied upon—We have nothing authentic from the Convention of Massachusetts, Reports on all hands say, that the division in that body will be great—but on which side the majority will be time must discover—The friends to the new government in this City, appear for a few days past, to despond with respect to Massachusets. The decision of that State will certainly have great influence on the final issue of the business—If they reject it I think it cannot go down, if they accept, every effort will be used to carry it through—We have nothing from the Southward— I wish you and Mr. Jones,3 would favour me, as your leisure and opportunities will permit, with your observations on this system, especially on the Judicial powers of it, about which very little has yet been written. It appears to me this part of the system is so framed as to clinch all the other powers; and to extend them in a silent and imperceptible manner to any thing and every thing, while the Court who are vested with these powers are totally independent, uncontroulable and not amenable to any other power in any decisions they may make4— What are the cases in equity arising under the Constitution? Will not the supreme court under this clause have a right to determine [639]enlarge the extent of the powers of the general government and to curtail that of the States at pleasure?— What are the cases of equity under Treaties? Will they not under this power be authorized to reverse all acts of attainder heretofore passed by the States, and to set aside all Judgements of Confiscation? I could state a number more questions, if I had time, but I am in haste—I only wish to call your attention, and that of Mr Jones to attend criticaly to this part of the plan, and beg your remarks upon it—We are weak here, the few that oppose it, have not leisure or ability or else want inclination to examine and expose its defects, such of you as are of the true faith at Pokeepsie should employ all your leisure in thinking and making remarks, if you have not time to arrange them for publication, they will afford great assistance to some here who will do it, if you will forward your observations to me. I could easily lengthen my Epistle but I am in haste—remember to your room companions"
Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,Giles Hickory,1/23/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, I am informed, that a number of gentlemen have been addressed by Mr. N—h W——r, accompanied with a pamphlet, entitled, “The American Magazine, for December 1787.” This curious work accidentially fell into my hands, although I have not the honor [640]of having been addressed. I enquired who N— W—— was, and am informed he was originally of Connecticut, where the polite arts have flourished for centuries, from the immence wealth of the country, the leisure of its inhabitants, and more especially from its cities; sources of all urbanity and polite literature, metaphysics, and good grammar; that this same N. W—— has wrote something about the English or American language, or a spelling book, or grammar,2 I cannot learn which—that a Mr. Kid, whether a relation of the former Capt. Kid the pirate, I cannot learn, has criticised upon N. W——’s institutes, or whatever they are called—and that it is, that Mr. Kid had greatly the advantage. But, Mr. Printer, the American Magazine, cum notis variorum.3 “The American Magazine.—A full stop. Containing A Miscellaneous Collection of Original and other valuable Essays, In Prose and Verse, And calculated both for Instruction and Amusement.” Now, sir, as Mr. N. W. is a grammarian, I conclude we are to have two Magazines; “and calculated both,” is the same as “and both calculated,” that is, “both American Magazine;”—perhaps he may have borrowed this word, “both,” which I have an unaccountable antipathy to, from the proposed new constitution, where I find it frequently used, or, as he was in Philadelphia at the time of the conclave, he might, from his famed institutes, have been called upon, and dictated the word both. But, Mr. Printer, let us proceed to the introduction. “The Editor of the American Magazine, for December 1787 (observes the last month in the year) presents the compliments of the season (by way of anticipation; this is a silent and secret operation) to his readers.[”] Now, I ask, whether he has any particular set of readers at command. As this is the first number, and only publication, who are his readers? But, sir, to go on, “and wishes them all the blessing they wish for themselves.” What a philanthropist! so, if any of his readers wish to debauch my wife or daughter he wishes they may stop. The editor is a metaphysician, as well as a grammarian. The word blessing always means something good; and an illicit indulgence is wicked—The thing itself is good, but the illicitness is bad. Well, now I am really afraid, that all his readers will not be able to make this nice, logical distinction; and if they cannot, and should abuse the good things of nature, they may hereafter plead, that the editor of the American Magazine, who must be a good authority, wished them to do the same thing. But nequid nimis, that is, too much of one thing is good for nothing—True, yet I [641]have heard, that there cannot be too much of a thing good in itself. Let us proceed. He begs leave, on the auspicious opening (a fine word) of the year 1788, to usher (I suppose he is some under teacher) into the world a new publication (yes, a new publication for an old year) which he designs to continue (then this same new publication is to be printed over and over and over[)]; well, one of them is more than I can digest. “He thinks it unnecessary to trouble his readers with an enumeration of the benevolent motives—(Now these last words I do not perfectly understand, for I am no metaphysician—but they sound a little like “a good plenum, or a bad vacuum”) which prompted him to this undertaking; for whatever he may say in his own favor, mankind will still have their own opinion of the editor’s views.[”] To this he has not “a single objection;” (artful! why could he not have said right off of hand, he had no objection; a man that has a thousand objections, to be sure, has not a single one—so the editor has not a single one, though he has a great many.)—(His readers would have been rather better, than mankind.) “While he is conscious, that, among several motives which actuate him, there is not a bad one.” Ambiguous, among a great number of motives, several may be good and several bad, as he calls them. Perhaps, if the editor had said, among the several, it would have included all his motives; but as it is, he seems to have called several favorite motives, none of which will he allow to be bad. The others, then, the editor has decided on. “It is the editor’s wish to gratify every class of readers, and his fair readers may be assured, that no inconsiderable pains will be taken to furnish them with entertainment; at the same time, he flatters himself, that many of the ladies will be found in the number of his correspondents.[”] I must confess, I do not like this passage; but I will take care, that none of my fair family shall be furnished by, or correspond with this redoubtable editor. Several other things might be observed upon this famous introduction, as the stowing away readers in bulk, &c. But the thirteenth page has just caught my eye. In his introduction, the editor says, “New-York is the most eligible situation for a publication of this kind.” Now I am at a loss to know why New-York is the most eligible situation for the publication of this thirteenth page. That the assertions should be made by a freeman, to an enlightened and free people, is offering a direct insult to their understanding. Is this usher, this grammatical pedlar, this new publication man, who reserves to himself the right of deciding on the merit of essays communicated, and the propriety of admitting them into the work, and consequently makes them all his own, is he happy in the choice of his situation for such a piece? If he is, I am deceived as to the good sense of the people of [642]New-York. The editor has dared to publish to the freemen of New-York, and to assert, that the objection to the new constitution, because it contains no bill of rights, is founded on ideas of government that are totally false. That our ancestors reasoned right, and because we reason in the same way, we adhere to old prejudices, and reason wrong. These are vain assertions without proof—But the editor goes on, “a bill of rights against the encroachments of kings, is perfectly intelligible,” and pray, are not the rights of worshipping as I please, and of being tryed by a jury, as perfectly intelligible under a republican form of government, as under a monarchical? “A bill of rights against the encroachments of an elective legislature, is a curiosity in government.[”] The editor would do well to shew, that it is so, because, his ipse dixit would not go very far, if stubborn facts were not directly against him. The next sentence, I think I may say, is a curiosity—and perhaps it is in point, to prove a bill of rights is not worth contending for, nay, that it is wrong to make it a constituent part, when forming a constitution. “One half of the people who read books, have so little ability to apply what they read to their own practice, that they had better not read at all.” How the editor arrived at the exact number I know not; it is a bad compliment to his readers. About one eighth of the people read; half of this eighth had better not read at all; therefore, fifteen sixteenths of the people, what are they better than cattle; and is this the reason why N. York is the most eligible situation for this publication. The privileges of a Britain are held as a birthright, or matters never alienated. They are not grants of the king; the barons, the only freemen in England in 1215, demanded, sword in hand, of the king, that he should renounce all claim to certain privileges of right belonging to them. Whatever might have been the knowledge of the barons of England at that time, I venture not to assert; but to think, that it was infinitely short of the knowledge of the good people of New-York in the science of government—Mr. Editor goes on, “These statutes are, however, not esteemed, because they are unalterable; for the same power that enacted them can at any moment repeal them; but they are esteemed, because they are barriers erected by the representatives of the nation against a power that exists independent of their own choice.” For the Editor’s consideration I shall extract several passages from Blackstone, observing by the way, that he says, the people of England were not represented in parliament till the year 1265. “Hence it indisputably appears, that parliaments, or general councils, are coeval with the kingdom itself; how those parliaments were constituted and composed, is another question, which has been a matter of great dispute, &c.”4 “Thus much for the declaration of our rights and liberties; which will appear from what has been premised to be indeed no other than [643]either that residuum of natural liberty, which is not required by the laws of society to be sacrificed to public convenience;” they may be said to remain, in a peculiar and emphatical manner, the rights of the people of England; “and these may be reduced to three primary articles: The right of personal security; the right of personal liberty, and the right of private property.”5 “To vindicate these rights, when actually violated, or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration, and free course of justice, in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances, and lastly to the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence—And all these rights and liberties it is our birth right to enjoy entire.”6 Perhaps, upon the principles before established, the convention might (if they pleased) have vested the regal dignity in a family entirely new. “These three princes, king William, queen Mary, and queen Anne, did not take the crown by hereditary right”—“formerly the descent was absolute, but now, upon the new settlement, the inheritance is conditional.”7 “The doctrine of hereditary right does by no means imply an indefeasible right to the throne.”8 It is evident, according to the learned judge, that the kings of England are not independent of the people, and yet that people have reserved that residuum of liberty, which is not necessary to be sacrificed to public convenience. That these rights have their existence otherwise than merely by acts of parliament. When King William came to the throne of England, there was a solemn compact, previous to his being declared king, called a bill of rights: The statute that soon after took place, contains nearly verbatim the same articles; if, however, the statute had been repealed, the bill of rights would have remained in force. The editor says, “In our government there is no power of legislation independent of the people.” Is there any power of legislation in England independent of the people? Surely there is not; and did these people, in their wisest days, draw such an absurd consequence? “There is no power existing against which it is necessary to guard.” “I undertake to prove, that a standing bill of rights is absurd (attend to the proof) because no constitutions (how many are there in a free government) can be unalterable. Cannot a constitution be altered without altering the bill of rights?—Cannot the constitution of Pennsylvania be essentially altered?—And is not all the alteration, contended for by its opposers, merely that of the deposit of the powers? Is it not the voice of the states in the Union, that the people have a right to alter their constitutions? We can have no greater power to enslave posterity, than they have to repeal the act, if found inconvenient. What idle attempt [644]at reasoning—we can only make ourselves happy in a particular way, by retaining some privileges, which, if the legislature possessed, would not be exercised, but for the purposes of slavery; yet we must not make this reservation for fear of enslaving our posterity. “The right of jury trial may in future cease to be a privilege—(It may so, Mr. Editor, if the person to be tried and his jury, are to travel five hundred miles) or other modes more satisfactory to the people may be devised; such an event is neither impossible nor improbable.”—There is but one other way, that is, for the judges to decide as to law and fact. And when this takes place, farewell to all liberty in America. I am happy in thinking, that the genius of America will spurn at the idea with as much contempt and energy as she did against the assumed power of the Parliament of Great-Britain. There need not be much said here. Where, Mr. Editor, did you learn, that there is an attempt to make a perpetual constitution? I never heard of such a thing, until I saw it in your new publication. Did you start this idea for the sake of building upon it near half a column of nonsense? As I have not time to pursue farther this metaphysical, grammatical institutional reasoner, I hope some other will find leisure to attend to him."
Newspaper,No,Sidney,,Albany Gazette,,1/24/1788,"“I aim at reformation, not satire; as I mean no invidious reflections, but only to give my sentiments with that honest freedom to which every [645]American is entitled by birthright: I shall just state from Polybius, the means by which all mixed governments have originally deviated from the first principles, which were the basis of their rise and grandeur; how by this deviation, they tended towards their decline, and that those means, acquiring additional force from that very decline, necessarily produced those evils which accelerated the destruction of every free people.” Montague.2 The discussions heretofore published, in favour of the requisitions of Congress, of the 3d February, 1781, and 18th April, 1783, for vesting that hon. body with power to levy an impost of five per cent.3 have appeared under the favourable aspect of a mere regulation, necessary and proper for the satisfaction of the public creditors and the support of national faith; as if, by investing Congress with a revenue, to be collected by officers of their own appointment, and laws of their own making, the public creditors would be sooner paid, and the national faith better preserved; but in its progression, it has assumed another form; we are now soon (perhaps too soon, for we have got into a habit of doing business either in secret or in haste) to be called upon to change the very principles of our government(a) contrary to the opinion of former authors, and to adopt that reported by the Convention, lately assembled at Philadelphia; in which the United States are to be consolidated, so as to become one republic, of upwards of four thousand miles(b) in circumference; Congress invested with legislative and judicial powers, and with it to decide whether we shall establish a strong executive, as well as to surrender an actual for a virtual representation. The Dutch have made experiments in both. By the one, they have entirely lost the right(c) of representation; by the other, they have embarrassed themselves with a stadtholder(d) (a strong executive whose mal-administration, within the space of forty years, has become so intolerable that the inhabitants, to get rid of him, are this day on the brink of ruin[)]. In these discussions, those who opposed the measure, and were for adhering to the confederation (as if words had lost their meaning) were distinguished by the appellation of “anti federal,” and those who were for altering the confederation and investing Congress with an independent revenue, assumed the epithet of “federal men;” and notwithstanding the late Convention, in their letter of the 17th September, have decided, viz. “but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trusts to one body of men is evident,”4 still the delusion is carried on, they call themselves federalists, when, in the same breath, they do not hesitate to say, they mean to destroy! entirely to destroy the confederation! [646] Misrepresentations, equally delusive, have been made in attempting to induce the several legislatures to invest Congress with the above mentioned revenue, with those, now daily propagated to establish the new constitution. While the former was in agitation, the papers were filled with accounts that several of the States had agreed to the impost system, and at last they went so far as to assert, that it had been adopted by eleven states, and that there were but two that had refused; and what is astonishing, gentlemen in dignified stations, attempted to confirm those misrepresentations; it was however discovered, when the laws of the different states, respecting that system, were published, in the year 1786, that it was doubtful whether two, of the thirteen, had fully adopted it.  When the late Convention was sitting (and under an injunction of secrecy) scarce a newspaper appeared, without a recommendation of the government in expectancy—That a government to be agreed to and countenanced by General Washington and Doctor Franklin, would be such as all good men ought to approve, and none but bad men would disapprove; and those who refused to give it their approbation, until they should have an opportunity of examining it, were treated as infidels in politics—and threatned, should they withhold their assent, to be insulted, tarred and feathered, and even in the late discussions, we meet with observations, tending to impress an opinion, that the consent of General Washington and Dr. Franklin, is not only a conclusive argument, to induce the people at large to determine in favour of the constitution, but that even to suppose they have erred or been imposed upon, is an impeachment of their understanding and integrity. A most extravagant way of reasoning. For when we calmly consider we shall find, that to err is inseparable to human nature; to be sure, to suppose that there was ever a general who understood military government better than the one, or any philosopher better acquainted with the powers of electricity than the other, would be justly reprehensible; but that they (admitting that they are not therefore the worse) should therefore be considered better, and even infallible judges of civil government (and that too, when they differ with Montesquieu, Locke, Sidney, and many other celebrated authors upon government) is inadmissible. When this new constitution was reported, and suffered by Congress barely in its passage to go on to the several legislatures, without their approbation; it was represented in the papers as having passed Congress with unanimous consent:6 now for a while we have been entertained with stories, how acceptable it is to the people in the several states—how readily the legislatures order conventions—and how those are insulted and their conduct reprobated, who are opposed to it; and [647]I shall not wonder, hereafter, to see it asserted in the papers, that it has been adopted by eleven states; when again, upon enquiry it may not have been fully adopted by two states. This kind of management is not uncommon after revolutions. Goldsmith mentions, that after the battle of La Houge (within four years after king William ascended the throne of England) “patriotism began to be ridiculed as an idle virtue—the practice of bribing a majority in parliament became universal: the example of the great was caught up by the vulgar, principle, and every decency was gradually banished—talents lay uncultivated, and the ignorant and profligate, were received into favour. That to remove the evil, parliament were diligent in restraining the universal corruption, that seemed to prevail over the whole kingdom—they were assiduously employed in bringing those to justice who were grown wealthy by public plunder, and encreasing the number of laws which restrained the art of peculation.”7 In the mean time Addison and Steele, in allusion to the doctrine, then propagated by Sacheveral and others, engrafted upon the policy of the cabal; “who were for establishing such a perpetual and extensive fund of revenue, to advance the prerogative, as would render parliaments useless,” tried to open the eyes of the people. “I have frequently (says Addison) wondered to see men of probity, who would scorn to utter a falshood for their own particular advantage, give so readily into a lie, when it becomes the voice of their faction, notwithstanding they are thoroughly sensible of it as such.”8 “Some tell us (says the same author) we ought to make our government upon earth, like that in heaven; which, say they, is altogether monarchial and unlimitted; was man like his Creator in goodness and justice, I should be for following this great model; but where goodness and justice are not essential to the ruler, I would by no means put myself into his hands, to be disposed of according to his particular will and pleasure. “Where the prince is a man of virtue, it is indeed happy for his people that he is absolute; but since in the common run of mankind, for one that is wise and good, you find ten of a contrary character, it is very dangerous for a nation to stand to its chance, or to have its public happiness or misery depend on the virtues and vices of a single man.”9 Steele, under the figure of two dances, represents the operation of the two forms of government, viz. absolute power, and the representation of a free state. In the first, he introduces absolute power, in the person of a tall man, with a hat and feather, who gives his first minister, that stands just before him, an huge kick—the minister gives the kick to the next below, and so to the end of the stage. In this moral and [648]practical jest, you are made to understand, that there is, in an absolute government, no gratification but giving the kick you receive from one above you to one below you; this is performed to a grave and melancholy air; but, on a sudden the tune moves quicker, and the whole company fall into a circle and take hands, and then at a certain sharp note, they move round and kick as kick can. This latter performance, he makes to be the representation of a free state; where, if you all mind your steps, you may go round and round very jollily, with a motion pleasant to yourselves and those you dance with; nay, if you put yourselves out, at the worst, you only kick and are kicked, like friends and equals. The two following paragraphs, taken from De Witt’s political maxims, contain a concise history of the management in the United Netherlands, after their revolution. “It appears (he says, page 7, 415) that the inhabitants of a republic are infinitely more happy, than subjects of a land governed by one supreme head; yet the contrary is always thought in a country where a prince is already reigning, or in republics, where one supreme head is ready to be accepted. “For not only officers, courtiers, idle gentry, and soldiery, but also all those that would be such, knowing, that under the worst Government they use to fare best, because they hope that with impunity they may plunder and rifle the citizens and country people, and so by the corruption of the government enrich themselves, or attain to grandeur, they cry upon monarchial government, for their private interest, to the very heavens: although God did at first mercifully institute no other but a commonwealth government, and afterwards in his wrath appointed one sovereign over them. Yet for all this, those bloodsuckers of the state, and indeed of mankind, dare to speak of republics with the utmost contempt, make a mountain of every mole hill, discourse of the defects of them at large, and conceal all that is good in them, because they know none will punish them for what they say. “The matter being thus, we must say, that all persons who for their particular interest do wilfully introduce such a monarchial government into our native country, will commit a crime which afterwards can never be remedied, but like Adam’s original sin be derived from father to son to perpetuity, and produce such pernicious effects that all the good order and laws of these provinces, whether civil or ecclesiastical, must at length be subverted. And, seeing crimen magistratis is properly committed against the laws of the sovereign power, namely either to assault the legislator himself, or to endeavour to alter the sovereign government; we must therefore conclude that the said inhabitants will by so [649]doing make themselves guilty of crimen magistratis and pas duellionis non fluxum sed permanens ni deternum, the most grievious, most durable and endless treason against this country.”10 I shall add an observation of Sallust that happened after the revolution at Rome, for he affirms, “that after the expulsion of the King, as long as the fear of Tranquin and the burthensome war with the Etrurians kept the Romans in suspence, the government was administered with equity and moderation. But as soon as ever the dread of those impending dangers was removed, the senate begun to domineer over the people and treat them as slaves; inflicting death or scouring after the arbitrary manner of dispotic tyrants; expelling them from their lands, and arrogating the whole government to themselves without communicating the least share of it to the Plebians.”11 Thus, “the people, before the creation of this magistracy, were amused with the name of liberty, whilst in fact they had only changed the tyranny of one for the more galling yoke of three hundred. But the tribunitial power proved an invincible obstacle to the arbitrary schemes of the aristocratic faction, and at last introduced that due admixture of democracy, which is so essentially necessary to the constitution of a well regulated republic.” To conclude for my own part, at this day when the matter has been discussed, and the dangers so fully pointed out; and, considering how zealous we have been in the cause of human nature, to counteract the kidnaping, and to secure the Africans, and their posterity from slavery; it is with difficulty I can suppose, persons of information recommending the adoption of this new constitution serious. It makes its appearance, in a worse point of view, than the carriage, after the horses have taken a start, and disengaged themselves from the reins; for there you may follow the track, and find the vehicle, which though abused, the owner may at his leisure repair. But upon the start of the late convention, when they refused to be guided by their credentials (which expressly confined their powers to be for the sole purpose of revising and amending the confederation)12 and presuming to recommend to the people this new instrument, is more like the horse-hunter, who after having used every contrivance to trapan, and ensnare, has recourse to wheedling, and cajolling, he goes up to the horse, and invites him to a feast, and while he perceives that the animal is apprehensive that he will deprive him of his liberty, scratches his ears, tries to make him believe, that he will not do like other horse-hunters, and abuse him; but if he will suffer him to put on the halter, he will give the animal usage as he likes and such as will be better for him than liberty, or at the option of the animal set him at liberty again; but no sooner has he the halter [650]well fixed, and the horse shews an inclination to disengage himself, he tells him, I have you fast now, and do what you can I shall not let you go, and you shall do what I order you, I will ride, whip, and spur you, and you shall have no more rest, or food than is sufficient to keep your skin and bones together; and when you are no longer fit to do my work, I will sell you, or if you die, I will sell your skin. (a)“It is proper also (says Bacon) not to try new experiments in the political body, unless the necessity be urgent, and the utility evident; and take care that the desire of reformation, may occasion the change—and not the desire of the change plead for the reformation. Again, let all novelty, though it cannot perhaps be rejected, yet be held suspected: & lastly, as the scripture directs, Let us stand up on the old paths, and see and ask for the good way, and walk therein.”    2 Bacon 154.1 “Polybias having traced government up to its first origin, explains the principles by which different governments arose to the summit of their power and grandeur, & proves that they sunk to ruin, by a more or less rapid progress, in proportion as they receded more or less from the first principles, on which they were originally founded.”    Montague 363.14 (b)“Political societies, like the human body, have their limits circumscribed, which they cannot exceed without disturbing their œconomy. An overgrown republic can only be saved from despotism, by subdividing it into a number of confederate republics.[”]    Marquis Becaria.15 “It is natural (says the great Montesquieu) for a republic to have only a small territory, otherwise it cannot long subsist,” &c.16 (c)“The magistrates of a certain city in Holland, so ordered the business, that the people in a general assembly, gave up the right of election; since which time, the senators have filled up all vacancies in their own body; and this example has been followed by all the other towns in the provinces.”    1 Bowen 547.17 (d)“This office in a manner supercedes the constitution. The stadtholder is president of the states of every province; and such is his power and influence, that he can change the deputies, magistrates and officers, in every province and city: by this, he has the moulding of the assembly of the states general, though he has no voice in it: in short, though he [651]has not the title he has more real power and authority than some kings.”    Guth.

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,1/24/1788,"To the People of the State of New-York. The liberties of a people are in danger from a large standing army, not only because the rulers may employ them for the purposes of supporting themselves in any usurpations of power, which they may see proper to exercise, but there is great hazard, that an army will subvert the forms of the government, under whose authority, they are raised, and establish one, according to the pleasure of their leaders. We are informed, in the faithful pages of history, of such events frequently happening.—Two instances have been mentioned in a former paper.1 They are so remarkable, that they are worthy of the most careful attention of every lover of freedom.—They are taken from the history of the two most powerful nations that have ever existed in the world; and who are the most renowned, for the freedom they enjoyed, and the excellency of their constitutions:—I mean Rome and Britain. In the first, the liberties of the commonwealth was destroyed, and the constitution overturned, by an army, lead by Julius Caesar, who was appointed to the command, by the constitutional authority of that commonwealth. He changed it from a free republic, whose fame had sounded, and is still celebrated by all the world, into that of the most absolute despotism. A standing army effected this change, and a standing army supported it through a succession of ages, which are marked in the annals of history, with the most horrid cruelties, bloodshed, and carnage;—The most devilish, beastly, and unnatural vices, that ever punished or disgraced human nature. The same army, that in Britain, vindicated the liberties of that people from the encroachments and despotism of a tyrant king, assisted Cromwell, their General, in wresting from the people, that liberty they had so dearly earned. You may be told, these instances will not apply to our case:—But those who would persuade you to believe this, either mean to deceive you, or have not themselves considered the subject. I firmly believe, no country in the world had ever a more patriotic army, than the one which so ably served this country, in the late war. But had the General who commanded them, been possessed of the spirit of a Julius Cesar or a Cromwell, the liberties of this country, had in all probability, terminated with the war; or had they been maintained, might have cost more blood and treasure, than was expended in the conflict with Great-Britain. When an anonimous writer addressed the officers of the army at the close of the war, advising them not to part with their arms, until justice was done them—the effect it had is well known.2 It affected them like an electric shock. He wrote like Cesar; and had the commander in chief, and a few more officers of rank, countenanced the measure, the desperate resolution had been taken, to refuse to disband. What the consequences of such a determination would have been, heaven only knows.—The army were in the full vigor of health and spirits, in the habit of discipline, and possessed of all our military stores and apparatus. They would have acquired great accessions of strength from the country.—Those who were disgusted at our republican forms of government (for such there then were, of high rank among us) would have lent them all their aid.—We should in all probability have seen a constitution and laws, dictated to us, at the head of an army, and at the point of a bayonet, and the liberties for which we had so severely struggled, snatched from us in a moment. It remains a secret, yet to be revealed, whether this measure was not suggested, or at least countenanced, by some, who have had great influence in producing the present system.3—Fortunately indeed for this country, it had at the head of the army, a patriot as well as a general; and many of our principal officers, had not abandoned the characters of citizens, by assuming that of soldiers, and therefore, the scheme proved abortive. But are we to expect, that this will always be the case? Are we so much better than the people of other ages and of other countries, that the same allurements of power and greatness, which led them aside from their duty, will have no influence upon men in our country? Such an idea, is wild and extravagant.—Had we indulged such a delusion, enough has appeared in a little time past, to convince the most credulous, that the passion for pomp, power and greatness, works as powerfully in the hearts of many of our better sort, as it ever did in any country under heaven.—Were the same opportunity again to offer, we should very probably be grossly disappointed, if we made dependence, that all who then rejected the overture, would do it again.  From these remarks, it appears, that the evils to be feared from a large standing army in time of peace, does not arise solely from the apprehension, that the rulers may employ them for the purpose of promoting their own ambitious views, but that equal, and perhaps greater danger, is to be apprehended from their overturning the constitutional powers of the government, and assuming the power to dictate any form they please. The advocates for power, in support of this right in the proposed government, urge that a restraint upon the discretion of the legislatures, in respect to military establishments in time of peace, would be improper to be imposed, because they say, it will be necessary to maintain small garrisons on the frontiers, to guard against the depredations of the Indians, and to be prepared to repel any encroachments or invasions that may be made by Spain or Britain.4 The amount of this argument striped of the abundant verbages with which the author has dressed it, is this: It will probably be necessary to keep up a small body of troops to garrison a few posts, which it will be necessary to maintain, in order to guard against the sudden encroachments of the Indians, or of the Spaniards and British; and therefore, the general government ought to be invested with power to raise and keep up a standing army in time of peace, without restraint; at their discretion. I confess, I cannot perceive that the conclusion follows from the premises. Logicians say, it is not good reasoning to infer a general conclusion from particular premises: though I am not much of a Logician, it seems to me, this argument is very like that species of reasoning. When the patriots in the parliament in Great-Britain, contended with such force of argument, and all the powers of eloquence, against keeping up standing armies in time of peace, it is obvious, they never entertained an idea, that small garrisons on their frontiers, or in the neighbourhood of powers, from whom they were in danger of encroachments, or guards, to take care of public arsenals would thereby be prohibited. The advocates for this power farther urge that it is necessary, because it may, and probably will happen, that circumstances will render it requisite to raise an army to be prepared to repel attacks of an enemy, before a formal declaration of war, which in modern times has fallen into disuse.5 If the constitution prohibited the raising an army, until a war actually commenced, it would deprive the government of the power of providing for the defence of the country, until the enemy were within our territory. If the restriction is not to extend to the raising armies in cases of emergency, but only to the keeping them up, this would leave the matter to the discretion of the legislature; and they [656]might, under the pretence that there was danger of an invasion, keep up the army as long as they judged proper—and hence it is inferred, that the legislature should have authority to raise and keep up an army without any restriction. But from these premises nothing more will follow than this, that the legislature should not be so restrained, as to put it out of their power to raise an army, when such exigencies as are instanced shall arise. But it does not thence follow, that the government should be empowered to raise and maintain standing armies at their discretion as well in peace as in war. If indeed, it is impossible to vest the general government with the power of raising troops to garrison the frontier posts, to guard arsenals, or to be prepared to repel an attack, when we saw a power preparing to make one, without giving them a general and indefinite authority, to raise and keep up armies, without any restriction or qualification, then this reasoning might have weight; but this has not been proved nor can it be. It is admitted that to prohibit the general government, from keeping up standing armies, while yet they were authorised to raise them in case of exigency, would be an insufficient guard against the danger. A discretion of such latitude would give room to elude the force of the provision. It is also admitted that an absolute prohibition against raising troops, except in cases of actual war, would be improper; because it will be requisite to raise and support a small number of troops to garrison the important frontier posts, and to guard arsenals; and it may happen, that the danger of an attack from a foreign power may be so imminent, as to render it highly proper we should raise an army, in order to be prepared to resist them. But to raise and keep up forces for such purposes and on such occasions, is not included in the idea, of keeping up standing armies in times of peace. It is a thing very practicable to give the government sufficient authority to provide for these cases, and at the same time to provide a reasonable and competent security against the evil of a standing army—a clause to the following purpose would answer the end: As standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, and have often been the means of overturning the best constitutions of government, no standing army, or troops of any description whatsoever, shall be raised or kept up by the legislature, except so many as shall be necessary for guards to the arsenals of the United States, or for garrisons to such posts on the frontiers, as it shall be deemed absolutely necessary to hold, to secure the inhabitants, and facilitate the trade with the Indians: unless when the United States are threatened with an attack or invasion from some foreign power, in which case the legislature [657]shall be authorised to raise an army to be prepared to repel the attack; provided that no troops whatsoever shall be raised in time of peace, without the assent of two thirds of the members, composing both houses of the legislature. A clause similar to this would afford sufficient latitude to the legislature to raise troops in all cases that were really necessary, and at the same time competent security against the establishment of that dangerous engine of despotism a standing army. The same writer who advances the arguments I have noticed, makes a number of other observations with a view to prove that the power to raise and keep up armies, ought to be discretionary in the general legislature; some of them are curious; he instances the raising of troops in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, to shew the necessity of keeping a standing army in time of peace;6 the least reflection must convince every candid mind that both these cases are totally foreign to his purpose—Massachusetts raised a body of troops for six months, at the expiration of which they were to disband of course; this looks very little like a standing army. But beside, was that commonwealth in a state of peace at that time? So far from it that they were in the most violent commotions and contests, and their legislature had formally declared that an unnatural rebellion existed within the state.7 The situation of Pennsylvania was similar; a number of armed men had levied war against the authority of the state, and openly avowed their intention of withdrawing their allegiance from it.8 To what purpose examples are brought, of states raising troops for short periods in times of war or insurrections, on a question concerning the propriety of keeping up standing armies in times of peace, the public must judge. It is farther said, that no danger can arise from this power being lodged in the hands of the general government, because the legislatures will be a check upon them, to prevent their abusing it.9 This is offered, as what force there is in it will hereafter receive a more particular examination. At present, I shall only remark, that it is difficult to conceive how the state legislatures can, in any case, hold a check over the general legislature, in a constitutional way. The latter has, in every instance to which their powers extend, complete controul over the former. The state legislatures can, in no case, by law, resolution, or otherwise, of right, prevent or impede the general government, from enacting any law, or executing it, which this constitution authorizes them to enact or execute. If then the state legislatures check the general legislatures, it must be by exciting the people to resist constitutional laws. In this way every individual, or every body of men, may check any government, in proportion to the influence they may have [658]over the body of the people. But such kinds of checks as these, though they sometimes correct the abuses of government, oftner destroy all government. It is further said, that no danger is to be apprehended from the exercise of this power, because it is lodged in the hands of representatives of the people; if they abuse it, it is in the power of the people to remove them, and chuse others who will pursue their interests.10 Not to repeat what has been said before, That it is unwise in any people, to authorize their rulers to do, what, if done, would prove injurious—I have, in some former numbers, shewn, that the representation in the proposed government will be a mere shadow without the substance.11 I am so confident that I am well founded in this opinion, that I am persuaded, if it was to be adopted or rejected, upon a fair discussion of its merits, without taking into contemplation circumstances extraneous to it, as reasons for its adoption, nineteen-twentieths of the sensible men in the union would reject it on this account alone; unless its powers were confined to much fewer objects than it embraces."
Newspaper,No,Expositor,,New York Journal,,1/24/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, The more I consider the doings of the late general convention, the more I admire them; and the greater is my surprise, that so many sensible men as are opposed to them, for not containing a bill of rights, should not instantly have seen that the whole, even to the resolves and letter which accompany the constitution,1 is little else than as copious a one, as ever perhaps, any known body of men stipulated for in the same manner! It really seems to me, as if all your antifederalists were under the same cloud, and could not see the woods for trees. This, I am aware, may, to you and them, at first, appear highly presumptuous in me; but, if I do not make good my assertion, by the time I go all through the constitution, I will publicly ask pardon of them and you. I confess, that the first time I viewed it in this light, I was a little staggered myself; but, by comparing one part with another, and the whole with its parts, as well as the conduct of several of the members who composed the convention, before and after its dissolution, with some of the alterations, arrangements and appointments of Congress which shall be noted occasionally, I was clear, that those honorable bodies must have considered it in the same point of view that I do. You may easily imagine, that a person of my frail constitution, was not a little elated by concluding himself fully in sentiment with Congress and the convention, especially the latter, and this immediately [660]determined me to attempt communicating my ideas of it, to you, in the best manner I could, and as early as business would permit. Wherever you may think me wrong, I am perfectly willing to submit my opinion to any two of the signing members, (the president excepted) who if they cannot agree, may call in another signing member to their assistance, or as an umpire. Or, if any other gentleman in this, or in either of the other states, should think my expositions deficient, and will be pleased to point out the defect by a line directed to the Printer of the New-York Journal and Daily Patriotic Register, for the Expositor, his observations shall be gratefully attended to, in time and place. Yet, I wish to observe, that whenever any thing appears doubtful or ambiguous, I mean to give it the most probable eventual construction, and which shall be fairly inferred from the assumption and conduct of the convention, as well as from the general tenor of the constitution itself, together with some of the late proceedings of Congress, &c. I persuade myself, sir, that your acknowledged candour will not permit you to refuse joining issue with me in this, and therefore, In the first place then, I shall endeavour to consider the Exordium.—And Oh! that I had the pen of a Junius, or Pratt.2 “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.” Is it not evident from the language used in this exordium, till we come to the words “Do ordain, &c.” that the convention had only themselves and their posterity in contemplation, in the forepart of it, and the United States in the latter part? Is not “We the people of the United States, etc. &c.” as applicable to the members of the convention, in their private capacities, as to any other people in the states? And do not the words “Domestic tranquility,” as well as “Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity,” warrant such an opinion? Is it not also further supported by the last clause; that is, “Do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.”—By which a distinction is created, that looks as if they all had intended to be the principal organizers of the new government, and had, in the very preface to it, taken care to have a bill of rights for themselves and their posterity? Nor is this so altogether unaccountable when it is considered that the gentlemen had secluded themselves from the rest of the United States, by forming a political conclave which produced their catholic creed:—Moreover, if the language of the Pennsylvania ratification [661]be attended to, will it not corroberate the foregoing sentiments? It is there said, “In the name of the people,” &c. “We the delegates of the people,” &c. “Do in the name and by the authority of the same people, and for ourselves,” &c.3 This, to be sure, does not sound quite so sovereign and independent, as—“We the people,” &c. But that, you know, is easily accounted for, by the one having authority for what they did, and the other None. And had the latter added—“Of our own mere motion,” &c. how truly descriptive of their right would it have read! Yet, it is imagined, that this plenipotent preface is sufficiently indicative of the assumed right of its authors to dissolve the present confederacy; which, if so, where is there any other body of men on earth, who can, justly, claim such another right? And now, with all due deference for the constitution itself.— “Article I. “Sect. 1.—All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.” (The remainder of this piece, under the signiture of “Expositor,” is unavoidably postponed to Thursday next.)

Newspaper,No,Senex (NY),,Albany Journal,,1/25/1788,"The freedom of the press has ever been advocated as the surest defence of liberty; and those who have made attempts to controul it, have deservedly met with the indignation of every lover of his country. Like other privileges, however, it cannot be kept from the reach of abuse, without destroying its essence. While law protects it as the channel through which the oppressed may utter their injuries, and the lowest innocent force the shafts of satire through the guards with which men in power are encompassed, it remains open also to the revengeful, the malevolent, and impotent coward; who may, while he shrouds himself in the dark, vent the poison of his heart, at those whom envy or blind party rage, has made the objects of his hate—The present political situation of America has given occasion to many strictures on characters in public life. Whenever they have been made with freedom and decency, the authors have conferred an obligation on their countrymen: but where passions have raved through their performances, and the language not of satire, but of a lower denomination, has been harshly mixed up for the purpose—where the aim has evidently been to gratify an unamiable disposition, there every benevolent mind has felt a wound, and the liberty of the press become a nuisance. To keep an eye on men in office, is the duty of every member of the community—and there is no danger of remissness in this species of vigilance among freemen: To sound the alarm, and drag the servants of the public to a tribunal, when they become unworthy or perfidious, and boldly declare their demerits, is manly—When questions of such importance as now engross our attention, stand for a decision, to draw forth all the resources of reason, with the energy of a mind raised, by [810]nature and improvement, above ignoble abilities, and with the divine influence of persuasion, to charm a world to a sense of propriety and truth, is noble—it is glorious, and commands our sublimest admiration. There are not wanting, in this critical day, characters adorned with a lustre of this eminence, who stand the unparall[el]ed boast and ornament of their country. The present occasion has turned out a bright train of patriots, who have displayed the intrinsic science of American politics in every view—and, from a confused mass of systems and experiments, led forth a succession of unanswerable truths. But while those who, with an unprejudiced disposition, are attentive to arguments on the subject, a set of vain, petulent scribblers open their sluices, and pour on the public an unwelcome inundation of scurrilous nonsense—intermixed with a detached, unapplicable parcel of notions, gathered from the writings of men of sense. The well wishers of a good cause are sorry to see it so unmercifully dirtied, by these officious literary coxcombs obtruding themselves as its advocates; who, while they fancy themselves elevated to the clouds, crawl, with the divers in the Dunciad, at the bottom of the miry pool.2 No simile can give a juster idea of them, than a pack of whiffits barking and snapping at the heels of a stranger, with all the spite of cowardly, impotent malice. To observe these little things emulating the works, for which great minds alone are destined, excite in us the emotions we feel at seeing children, in mock plays, acting the characters of heroes; or mad men swaggering with the fancied importance of princes.—To be enabled to bluster, in a style fitted for such purposes, requires no other education than what is common along the dock-yards of a populous town—where all the necessary epithets and metaphors are daily repeated, and the copious use of them considered as the characteristic of manliness. None but those, who are seasoned with such spice, can sink so low; and none but a scoundrel will assassinate his neighbour in the dark. The man of honor will meet his antagonist like a soldier, and not disgrace his colours by shrinking from the ranks, and like a murderer, give the blow without hailing his enemy. It is the business of a printer to guard these avenues, which policy leaves to the indiscriminate use and abuse of the public, not merely so as to evade the penalties of the law, but in such manner that no innocent person be hurt, by the malignant rancor of those whose supreme delight is wanton defamation: And should any one so far mistake his interest as, by his manner of conducting a press, to avow the base motives of attracting employment by the singular abusiveness of his publications, he ought to be abhorred as a wit, and the man who would give the wretch a glimpse of encouragement, be ranked among the [811]vilest enemies of mankind. Like progressive advances in villany, some may expect to rise in boldness, from one step to another, under the expectation of proceeding to any extreme, with the same impunity they began, but let it be remembered, that beyond a certain point, the man who knows the value of a character, will not suffer the remarks of a censurer and may think the sacrifice of a like but an inadequate expiation for stains of such unhallowed touches. There are still spirits who, though they may for a while pass the freaks of a monkey, without deigning them attention, will, when its liberties become hurtful, drag the animal from its hole, behind whatever skreen it may skulk, and give it the chastisement its impertinence merits. When rebellion is the object, reason must be silenced by the noise of declamation, and inflammatory addresses are the trumpets, which muster the tools of reason to the combat. If this be the intent of the pieces which have lately disgraced the city, let the authors recollect, that they are addressing a people who are capable of distinguishing between rational language and the roarings of a mad man; or let them gather all their engines at once, and wreak their vengeance on the Rough Hewer and the obnoxious of his party, but let the patience of the public be no longer abused with a jargon of indecent Canvastown eloquence."
Letter,Yes,Charles Tillanghast,Hugh Hughes,,,1/27/1788,"Friday about twelve o’Clock the Boys arrived at my House, and handed me your favour, with the inclosures.2 The Piece signed Countryman, you will find inserted in Greenleaf’s paper,3 and part of the Expositor in Thursday’s Paper4—I consulted the General,5 and he was of opinion with me, that the Expositor had better be inserted in Thursday’s than any other, as that Paper had a more general Circulation in the Country, than that of any other day in the Week6—This will, I trust, account satisfactorily, for the division of the Piece—he has seperated it at a part which excites the curiosity of People to see the Remainder, and they will of course read the residue with pleasure. Brutus, you will find in the same paper7—that piece, was deposited for Thursday’s Paper, before the Expositor came to hand, otherwise the latter would have had the preference, and Brutus would have been in continuation. I am of Opinion with you, that it will be best to have the political pieces delivered, as they come to hand, to Greenleaf; for I put the Interrogator8 into the hands of Cato, who gave it to Brutus to read, and between them, I have not been able to get it published, Cato having promised me from time to time that he would send it to Greenleaf—It shall be inserted, I am determined, in Tuesday’s Paper— You will observe in the Countryman, a small alteration viz—for Baron,9 is inserted a certain head; which I did at the request of the General, who observed that as the Baron did not interest himself openly with respect to the Constitution, it would have too personal a nature, and it might involve Greenleaf in embarrassment; and that the words substituted, pointed to him, almost as clearly, as if his name had been mentioned—As I know you wish to indulge your friend, provided you can be consistent, I did not hesitate to comply with the General’s request—I trust you will excuse me for the freedom I have taken—I should not have done it, from my own suggestions of propriety. You will be surprised, I am confident, at the appointment of Hamilton to Congress10—but I can account for it in some measure—I attribute it to Benson’s11 Influence in both Houses—he is, as you no doubt are informed, a strong new-government man—I cannot but help thinking, that the Republican staid here too long; for after he had delivered his speech, he immediately came to Town, and did not set off ’till Thursday [668] last,12 and it was on That day, or the Tuesday before, that the appointment took place—I am sure they took the advantage of his absence.—The appointment of Phocion13 I am clear will not be pleasing to the Republican, but, I think, he may charge it to his own account; for if he had been at Poughkeepsie, at the time, he would have had sufficient influence to have prevented it. The Papers will give you a better account of the state of Politicks than I can collect otherwise— The federalists, as they are pleased to call themselves, have their doubts whether Massachusetts will adopt the new constitution proposed—they say, if that state does not, it will never take place—from which we may infer, that the prayers of the whole tribe of office seekers—would be Officers &c &c—are daily put up for the fulfillment of their Wishes—Mr. Gerry writes that he is clearly of opinion that their is a majority against it14—But whether it proceeds from my not being of so sanguine a disposition as some of my Neighbours, I must confess to you, I have my fears.—They are grounded on a variety of reasons, but the chief are, that most of the men of abilities, learning, information and intrigue, (but not of honesty, with regard to the liberties of the People at large) in the Massachusetts Convention, are in favour of the new System; their sitting in Boston, is also not in favour of the People; for the more honest, tho’ less informed, will be the more likely to be duped and cajoled by the designing ones, who will treat them with Dinners &c. &c.15 Another reason I can assign, which is a very strong one, with me, and that is, on examining the list of delegates, I find that there are seventeen Clergymen;16 delegates from different Towns; and altho’ the precepts of that Religion, which they profess, and whose principles they endeavour to impress on their hearers, strongly recommend humility &c, yet there are no set of Men, collectively who have more pride, and who are possessed of more arbitrary principles—I have not taken up this opinion hastily; but from a particular attention I have paid to their Conversation, deportment &c, not only in this State, but those others in which I have travelled—And as the new Constitution does not exclude them from offices under it, and the Constitutions of the different states (this, and one or two more, excepted)17 permitting them to hold civil and other Offices, I have not a doubt but they will be found, at the close of this important Business, almost generally, the most zealous advocates for the adoption of the proposed government—I know you are fully sensible of the influence they commonly have on the minds of the more ignorant, tho not less virtuous part, of the community; and I make not a doubt, but they will use their utmost exertions as well in, as out of Convention, to make proselytes to the new faith. In my last letter, I inclosed you the Copy of a short one I received from Colonel Pickering.—A few days ago I recd. the original, of which the inclosed is a Copy,18 and as I knew, that you would be glad to see what he could say for himself, I prevailed on John to assist me in copying it—from the pains he has taken, and the complexion of the postscript, I believe he intended that I should publish it—but as his reasons does not convince me, I shall not do it. I wish my abilities were sufficient to enable me to enter into a full discussion of the subject—in that case, it is probable, the charge of inconsistency, at least, might be retorted on him—He shews, I think, more Temper in this last letter, than he ordinarly does—particularly in that part, where he says, that the Opposition in Massachusetts, consists only of Paper-money men, and Shayites—does he include in this Description Mr. Gerry, Mr. S. Adams and Mr. Dane?19 men, who have borne some of the most important Offices in that State, and have all been Delegates to Congress—But, the spirit of party will, generally, ever predominate.… I gave him [John Lamb] your letter to read, as it respected political matters.…"
Letter,Yes,Charles Tillanghast,Hugh Hughes,,,1/28/1788,"P.S. The Boys set out in about an hour—From the account brought by the eastern Post it appears pretty evident that there is a decided majority against the new Constitution in the Massachusetts Convention—You will find in Greenleaf’s of this day an extract of a letter from Boston—The Letter was received by Greenleaf, from one of his Correspondents.20 The extract from Edes’s paper, serves to convince me that no means will be left unessayed to get a majority, however small, in favour of the government proposed.21 I had like to have forgot mentioning to you that I believe the Writer, who has attacked Noah Webster, to be Mr. Osgood,22—it is only my conjecture, as, from delicacy, I did not ask the General, the writer’s name—it was handed to him by the Author, for his opinion, and if he approved of it, to send it for Publication. I shall send you the Magazine, as it is probable he may prove vulnerable in some other instances, than those which have been noticed. I should have been more circumspect with regard to names; if this Letter went by any other Conveyance, but as it will be delivered into your own hands, I did not think it requisite to use more caution than I have done— P.S. in continuation— I cannot but consider the appointment of Hamilton as a very considerable point gained over the opponents to the new Constitution, as his election holds up an idea of the approbation of the Legislature [670]respecting his late Conduct in General Convention, which, no doubt, will be made a handle of by the federalists and, I think, it also implies an indirect censure on Mr. Judge Yates & Mr Lansing.23 I have not time to add further—Adieu—"

All sides are waiting here with anxious expectation for the determination of the Convention of Massachusetts. Both the favourers and opposers say, that they have a majority.

Let me hear from you as often as you can"
Letter,Yes,John Williams,,,,1/29/1788,"“The new constitution is not yet taken up, various are the opinions upon this subject; if I can have my opinion carried it will be this, let it come to the people without either recommending or disapprobation; let the people judge for themselves—if the majority is for it, let it be adopted—if they are against it, let it be rejected, as all powers are, or ought to be, in the people; they, and they only, have the right to say whether the form of government shall be altered. For my own part, I must confess, under the present situation of affairs, something must be done, but whether the present system is the best will be the question. The powers given to the president are very great. The elections may be so altered as to destroy the liberty of the people. The direct taxation, and to be collected by officers of Congress, are powers which cannot be granted agreeable to our present constitution, nor will it be very convenient for Congress officers, and our state collectors, to be collecting both at one time, and as Congress may lay a poll tax, how will that agree with us. I need not tell you the injustices of it. If the new constitution is adopted, Congress hath all the impost and excise; this latter may be laid heavy on taverns and spirits, so that the emoluments from taverns, which are now converted to the use of the poor, must go to Congress; and what is yet worse, all the duties arising from any duties or excise, are to be appropriated to the use of Congress. “You will also observe that senators are for six years, and that small states have an equal number with large states, so that the advantage of having property in a maritime state, will be reduced to an equal value with the property where there is no navigation. If this is not taking our liberty, it is certainly diminishing our property, which is equal to it. What hath kept the taxes so low in this state—the reason is obvious, our impost duties.2 This is a privilege Providence hath endowed us with; our landed property will ever sell according to the conveniency of it; the lighter the tax, the higher the land; the nigher to market, the greater profits arising from our produce. Let our imposts and advantages be taken from us, shall we not be obliged to lay as heavy taxes as Connecticut, Boston, &c. What hath kept us from those burthens but the privileges, which we must lose if the present proposed constitution is adopted.”"
Newspaper,No,Expositor,,New York Journal,,1/31/1788,"(Continued from Thursday last.) Does not this small section ascertain a most ample and important right to the new Congress? I acknowledge that it seems to clash a little with the second clause of the second section in the second article, as well as with the second clause of the sixth article; the former of which impowers the president, in conjunction with two thirds of the senators present, to make treaties, which the other clause says, shall be the supreme laws of the land, &c. But this may have proceeded from a redundance of power and wisdom, which, by a majority of the members, as well as some others, were supposed to be the inherent qualities of the convention. “Sect. 2. The house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year, by the people of the several states, and the electors, in each state, shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.” I expect, you will readily acknowledge, that, by this the right of biennial representation is clearly and fully fixed, which, no doubt, will be improved to triennial and septennial, in time; as the constitution admits of improvement, you know. Besides, as all constitutions, that we have any account of, have undergone very great improvements, in the hands of their administrators, we can have no reason, at least none that I know of, at present, to suspect, that this, though a come-by-chance, [662]will be neglected; especially if we reflect on the fondness of the parents for their issue, which, in temper and features, I grant, bears a strong resemblance to some of them. And not only so, but, if we consider the address, gallantry and influence of several who contributed to its existence, is there not every inducement to expect, that they will make suit to its organization, should it ever arrive to that age? When, if not discouraged in what they have already begun, they may make such rapid improvements in government and jurisprudence, as not only to surprize their constituents, but astonish the world, and that merely by maturating their natural offspring.—Again, “No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty-five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen.” Here we have a right indubitably secured to us, and one, perhaps, which some of the antifederalists have not adverted to; that is, a right to prefer age and folly to youth and understanding, in whig or tory, no matter which, if but full five and twenty or upwards, &c. How liberal! None of your little, contracted, whiggish criterions, such as, a reputable character, good sense, and invariable friend to the independence of the United States, to the rights and liberties of the people, &c. No, no, there is no harm in his having been in arms against this country; perhaps it may be requisite for him to be in arms against it again, and then, it may be supposed, that he will make the better officer, as being more likely to act from principle, especially if he engaged in the British service from that motive. By the most liberal construction of this clause, there seems to be another curious right intended for the inhabitants of the United States, and which had well nigh escaped me until this moment; and that is, the right of chusing our representatives of either colour, for here is no distinction, that I perceive. The one colour appears as eligible as the other; if but round five and twenty years of age, &c. And this corresponds so exactly with a representative for every “thirty thousand” (black or white) as unconditionally mentioned in the next clause, that it may have been intended as some kind of compensation for dragging the former, by violence, &c. from their native country, into unlimited slavery. Should this have been the design of the convention, as well as to enlarge and diversify our choice, I verily believe that nothing short of infinite redundance, could ever have dictated such liberal and gracious sentiments towards the unfortunate people in contemplation, and us. Yet, it may not be amiss to observe, that much of this must depend on the interpretation given to the first part of the first clause of the fifth [663]section, as well as the latter part of the second clause, of the same section. As the former declares, that “Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members;” and the latter, that “each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behaviour, and with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member.” Not for disorderly behaviour, you will please to observe, sir, though it may appear so, at first view, but absolutely; and that perhaps, for not appearing in the ton of the “ten-mile-square,” or not living in the style of the court, &c. That is, keeping an assortment of w——s, horses and hounds, or purchasing a premature seduction at the expence of the public, &c. This is imagined, is what Mr. P—k—y alludes to, in his observations on the plan of government, which he submitted to the convention, when he says, “Respectable appointments,” &c.4 But alas! Mr. Printer, the language of this presumptive constitution, is so compressed, there is so much implied, and so much involved in it, by the subtilest choice of the most equivocal and comprehensive terms, in some places, as well as the most artful arrangements and combinations of sentences, &c. in others, besides here and there a few seeming contradictions or inconsistencies, &c. which require all the elucidation it is possible to give them, that, I am really afraid, it will scarcely bear the same proportion to my expositions, that Boerhaave’s institutes do to Van Swieten’s commentaries,5 which are, (if my memory serve, for it is now many years since I read them) in the ratio of volumes, as one is to eighteen. But to proceed, “Representation and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New-Hampshire shall be entitled to choose three; Massachusetts eight; Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one; Connecticut five; New-York six; New-Jersey four; Pennsylvania eight; Delaware one; Maryland six; Virginia ten; North-Carolina five; South-Carolina five; and Georgia three.” This copious and comprehensive clause contains a number of very ample rights, some of which are sufficiently defined, and others involved, [664]whilst several are only to be inferred from implication.—Among the former, we find the rights of representation and direct taxes hold the first place, and which in fact, involve almost every other right in the possessors of those two. But, although those two principal rights are pretty clearly expressed, as well as the mode of ascertaining them; yet, are the objects of that mode not so fully defined as could be wished. The words, “By adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years—three fifths of all other persons,” are not sufficiently descriptive, as was observed above, of the objects of enumeration, to prevent disputes and injustice, though they may fully enough admit of the potential right of the new Congress to define the objects, as they do the right of throwing the burden of taxes on the poor, and people in middling circumstances, and that of both sexes—yes, even on poor women who go out to labour for the support of several helpless children, aye, on the very children themselves, some of whom, perhaps, may be in their mere infancy, in the cradle; as the term “person” may include every human creature, whether born or unborn, which last, if requisite for ascertaining the quota of a state, may, of course, be an object of capitation or a poll tax, could its complete existence be fully established. ⟨And this may produce a right of celibacy, or not marrying, in the one sex, and something worse in the other, at least something more criminal in the eye of the law, which, together with the importation and virtual representation of the Africans in the southern states, may, in a few years, greatly affect the interests of the northern, in national concerns.⟩6 Whilst a part of the very same words, that is, “three fifths of all other persons,” undoubtedly implies a right of exemption from taxes, for the other two fifths of the superannuated and infant slaves, &c. And that to screen the great overgrown landholders, whose numberless acres cannot be so easily measured, as the heads of the people can be counted. Does the right of oppression proceed from a redundance of wisdom or riches? (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,1/31/1788,"The nature and extent of the judicial power of the United States, proposed to be granted by this constitution, claims our particular attention. Much has been said and written upon the subject of this new system on both sides, but I have not met with any writer, who has discussed the judicial powers with any degree of accuracy. And yet it is obvious, that we can form but very imperfect ideas of the manner in which this government will work, or the effect it will have in changing the internal police and mode of distributing justice at present subsisting in the respective states, without a thorough investigation of the powers of the judiciary and of the manner in which they will operate. This government is a complete system, not only for making, but for executing laws. [681]And the courts of law, which will be constituted by it, are not only to decide upon the constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it, but by officers subordinate to them to execute all their decisions. The real effect of this system of government, will therefore be brought home to the feelings of the people, through the medium of the judicial power. It is, moreover, of great importance, to examine with care the nature and extent of the judicial power, because those who are to be vested with it, are to be placed in a situation altogether unprecedented in a free country. They are to be rendered totally independent, both of the people and the legislature, both with respect to their offices and salaries. No errors they may commit can be corrected by any power above them, if any such power there be, nor can they be removed from office for making ever so many erroneous adjudications. The only causes for which they can be displaced, is, conviction of treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. This part of the plan is so modelled, as to authorise the courts, not only to carry into execution the powers expressly given, but where these are wanting or ambiguously expressed, to supply what is wanting by their own decisions. That we may be enabled to form a just opinion on this subject, I shall, in considering it, 1st. Examine the nature and extent of the judicial powers—and 2d. Enquire, whether the courts who are to exercise them, are so constituted as to afford reasonable ground of confidence, that they will exercise them for the general good. With a regard to the nature and extent of the judicial powers, I have to regret my want of capacity to give that full and minute explanation of them that the subject merits. To be able to do this, a man should be possessed of a degree of law knowledge far beyond what I pretend to. A number of hard words and technical phrases are used in this part of the system, about the meaning of which gentlemen learned in the law differ. Its advocates know how to avail themselves of these phrases. In a number of instances, where objections are made to the powers given to the judicial, they give such an explanation to the technical terms as to avoid them. Though I am not competent to give a perfect explanation of the powers granted to this department of the government, I shall yet attempt to trace some of the leading features of it, from which I presume it will appear, that they will operate to a total subversion of the state judiciaries, if not, to the legislative authority of the states. In article 3d, sect. 2d, it is said, “The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of [682]the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority, &c.” The first article to which this power extends, is, all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution. What latitude of construction this clause should receive, it is not easy to say. At first view, one would suppose, that it meant no more than this, that the courts under the general government should exercise, not only the powers of courts of law, but also that of courts of equity, in the manner in which those powers are usually exercised in the different states. But this cannot be the meaning, because the next clause authorises the courts to take cognizance of all cases in law and equity arising under the laws of the United States; this last article, I conceive, conveys as much power to the general judicial as any of the state courts possess. The cases arising under the constitution must be different from those arising under the laws, or else the two clauses mean exactly the same thing. The cases arising under the constitution must include such, as bring into question its meaning, and will require an explanation of the nature and extent of the powers of the different departments under it. This article, therefore, vests the judicial with a power to resolve all questions that may arise on any case on the construction of the constitution, either in law or in equity. 1st. They are authorised to determine all questions that may arise upon the meaning of the constitution in law. This article vests the courts with authority to give the constitution a legal construction, or to explain it according to the rules laid down for construing a law.—These rules give a certain degree of latitude of explanation. According to this mode of construction, the courts are to give such meaning to the constitution as comports best with the common, and generally received acceptation of the words in which it is expressed, regarding their ordinary and popular use, rather than their grammatical propriety. Where words are dubious, they will be explained by the context. The end of the clause will be attended to, and the words will be understood, as having a view to it; and the words will not be so understood as to bear no meaning or a very absurd one. 2d. The judicial are not only to decide questions arising upon the meaning of the constitution in law, but also in equity. By this they are empowered, to explain the constitution according to the reasoning spirit of it, without being confined to the words or letter. “From this method of interpreting laws (says Blackstone) by the reason of them, arises what we call equity;” which is thus defined by Grotius, [683]“the correction of that, wherein the law, by reason of its universality, is deficient; for since in laws all cases cannot be foreseen, or expressed, it is necessary, that when the decrees of the law cannot be applied to particular cases, there should some where be a power vested of defining those circumstances, which had they been foreseen the legislator would have expressed; and these are the cases, which according to Grotius, lex non exacte definit, sed arbitrio boni viri permittet.” The same learned author observes, “That equity, thus depending essentially upon each individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed principles of equity laid down, without destroying its very essence, and reducing it to a positive law.”1 From these remarks, the authority and business of the courts of law, under this clause, may be understood. They will give the sense of every article of the constitution, that may from time to time come before them. And in their decisions they will not confine themselves to any fixed or established rules, but will determine, according to what appears to them, the reason and spirit of the constitution. The opinions of the supreme court, whatever they may be, will have the force of law; because there is no power provided in the constitution, that can correct their errors, or controul their adjudications. From this court there is no appeal. And I conceive the legislature themselves, cannot set aside a judgment of this court, because they are authorised by the constitution to decide in the last resort. The legislature must be controuled by the constitution, and not the constitution by them. They have therefore no more right to set aside any judgment pronounced upon the construction of the constitution, than they have to take from the president, the chief command of the army and navy, and commit it to some other person. The reason is plain; the judicial and executive derive their authority from the same source, that the legislature do theirs; and therefore in all cases, where the constitution does not make the one responsible to, or controulable by the other, they are altogether independent of each other. The judicial power will operate to effect, in the most certain, but yet silent and imperceptible manner, what is evidently the tendency of the constitution:—I mean, an entire subversion of the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the individual states. Every adjudication of the supreme court, on any question that may arise upon the nature and extent of the general government, will affect the limits of the state jurisdiction. In proportion as the former enlarge the exercise of their powers, will that of the latter be restricted. That the judicial power of the United States, will lean strongly in favour of the general government, and will give such an explanation [684]to the constitution, as will favour an extension of its jurisdiction, is very evident from a variety of considerations. 1st. The constitution itself strongly countenances such a mode of construction. Most of the articles in this system, which convey powers of any considerable importance, are conceived in general and indefinite terms, which are either equivocal, ambiguous, or which require long definitions to unfold the extent of their meaning. The two most important powers committed to any government, those of raising money, and of raising and keeping up troops, have already been considered, and shewn to be unlimitted by any thing but the discretion of the legislature.2 The clause which vests the power to pass all laws which are proper and necessary, to carry the powers given into execution, it has been shewn, leaves the legislature at liberty, to do every thing, which in their judgment is best.3 It is said, I know, that this clause confers no power on the legislature, which they would not have had without it4—though I believe this is not the fact, yet, admitting it to be, it implies that the constitution is not to receive an explanation strictly, according to its letter; but more power is implied than is expressed. And this clause, if it is to be considered, as explanatory of the extent of the powers given, rather than giving a new power, is to be understood as declaring, that in construing any of the articles conveying power, the spirit, intent and design of the clause, should be attended to, as well as the words in their common acceptation. This constitution gives sufficient colour for adopting an equitable construction, if we consider the great end and design it professedly has in view—there appears from its preamble to be, “to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity.” The design of this system is here expressed, and it is proper to give such a meaning to the various parts, as will best promote the accomplishment of the end; this idea suggests itself naturally upon reading the preamble, and will countenance the court in giving the several articles such a sense, as will the most effectually promote the ends the constitution had in view—how this manner of explaining the constitution will operate in practice, shall be the subject of future enquiry.5 2d. Not only will the constitution justify the courts in inclining to this mode of explaining it, but they will be interested in using this latitude of interpretation. Every body of men invested with office are tenacious of power; they feel interested, and hence it has become a kind of maxim, to hand down their offices, with all its rights and privileges, [685]unimpared to their successors; the same principle will influence them to extend their power, and increase their rights; this of itself will operate strongly upon the courts to give such a meaning to the constitution in all cases where it can possibly be done, as will enlarge the sphere of their own authority. Every extension of the power of the general legislature, as well as of the judicial powers, will increase the powers of the courts; and the dignity and importance of the judges, will be in proportion to the extent and magnitude of the powers they exercise. I add, it is highly probable the emolument of the judges will be increased, with the increase of the business they will have to transact and its importance. From these considerations the judges will be interested to extend the powers of the courts, and to construe the constitution as much as possible, in such a way as to favour it; and that they will do it, appears probable. 3d. Because they will have precedent to plead, to justify them in it. It is well known, that the courts in England, have by their own authority, extended their jurisdiction far beyond the limits set them in their original institution, and by the laws of the land. The court of exchequer is a remarkable instance of this. It was originally intended principally to recover the king’s debts, and to order the revenues of the crown. It had a common law jurisdiction, which was established merely for the benefit of the king’s accomptants. We learn from Blackstone, that the proceedings in this court are grounded on a writ called quo minus, in which the plaintiff suggests, that he is the king’s farmer or debtor, and that the defendant hath done him the damage complained of, by which he is less able to pay the king. These suits, by the statute of Rutland, are expressly directed to be confined to such matters as specially concern the king, or his ministers in the exchequer. And by the articuli super cartas, it is enacted, that no common pleas be thenceforth held in the exchequer contrary to the form of the great charter: but now any person may sue in the exchequer. The surmise of being debtor to the king being matter of form, and mere words of course; and the court is open to all the nation.6 When the courts will have a president [i.e., precedent] before them of a court which extended its jurisdiction in opposition to an act of the legislature, is it not to be expected that they will extend theirs, especially when there is nothing in the constitution expressly against it? and they are authorised to construe its meaning, and are not under any controul? This power in the judicial, will enable them to mould the government, into almost any shape they please.—The manner in which this may be effected we will hereafter examine."
Newspaper,No,Expositor,,New York Journal,,2/7/1788,"(Concluded from last Thursday’s Paper.) But these “three fifths of all other persons,” produce another right also, which, though rather latent, in some respects, I shall endeavour to expose. It is the right of the southern states to send one representative to the new Congress for every fifty thousand slaves which they now have, or may import. For, three fifths of fifty thousand, if I mistake not, are equal to thirty thousand, which entitles them to a representation. And this may be termed the right of infecundity, as it seems to have been ascertained and admitted as a compensation for the insalubrity [665]of the climate, which, with luxury and idleness, the inevitable consequences of a numerous slavery, does not admit of as rapid natural population as any. It also serves as an auxiliary for preserving an equilibrium to those states in the division of the loaves and fishes. And, as to the right of representation for every thirty thousand, though rather meagre, as the people from whom we separated, have nearly one for every sixteen thousand; yet, all circumstances considered, is not so trifling a favour as some of your antifederalists, or, perhaps, as you call them, real federalists, have insinuated. For, could not the same self-sufficient power which granted one for every thirty thousand, have denied us any; and where, in such case, would have been our remedy, if no alteration or amendment could have taken place? Besides, a right of virtual representation, for every thirty thousand, must be a redundance for those states, where, probably, all the constituents are the property of a hundred or more planters, &c. and, whose wants and sufferings, though numerous and pressing, no doubt, yet, are all very nearly alike. But if we take a comparative view of the southern right of virtual representation with our own real representation, I am afraid, that we shall not have quite so much reason for exultation as Publius and some others have asserted. As one hundred planters, in those states, each having five hundred slaves, will have a right of representation, when it will require five thousand of our northern farmers, supposing their families each to average six persons, to entitle them to the same right. This, I confess, is rather a disagreeable comparison; but it certainly was made in and by the convention, and the delegate from this state acceded to it alone, on the part of the state. With what right they know best who deputed him, and, as the legislature are now convened, to them I refer him, for the present, only observing, that if he had not the most full and ample powers for what he did (and I never heard it pretended that he had) I cannot help thinking it a most daring insult offered to the free men and freeholders of this state, besides being an unparalleled departure from his duty to this state, as well as to the United States. However, to place this right of virtual representation in the southern states in every possible point of view, besides doing justice to the merits of the delegate of this state, and others in a similar situation, I beg leave to ask, whether the northern states have not as just a right to a representation for every three fifths of their live stock, if of equal value, if not, say four fifths; or, should this be thought insufficient, let it be five fifths, or the whole fifty thousand, &c. as the southern states have to a representation for every three fifths of their slaves, who, greater is the shame and pity, have no more will or freedom of choice, of their own, than our live stock. Nay not half so much as some part of it? Must there not have been something in prospect, from the new government, exceedingly fascinating, to induce the delegate of the state, in the very delicate situation which he was, singly and alone, to make such an invidious and degrading concession, on the part of an unrepresented people? I venerate the defenders of this country in every state, but what more has been done by the southern states than by the northern, especially this, which was the seat of the war, to the last of the contest, I shall be glad to learn? Has any one of them as a state, or have they all, made greater exertions than this? Have they shed their blood more liberally or nobly than we have? Or is it richer or more prolific? The concession demanded and made, gives the negative to the latter; but, without any reflection on the others, I believe them equally brave. To be continued by The EXPOSITOR."

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,2/7/1788,"In my last,2 I shewed, that the judicial power of the United States under the first clause of the second section of article eight, would be authorized to explain the constitution, not only according to its letter, but according to its spirit and intention; and having this power, they would strongly incline to give it such a construction as to extend the powers of the general government, as much as possible, to the diminution, and finally to the destruction, of that of the respective states. I shall now proceed to shew how this power will operate in its exercise to effect these purposes. In order to perceive the extent of its influence, I shall consider, First. How it will tend to extend the legislative authority. Second. In what manner it will increase the jurisdiction of the courts, and Third. The way in which it will diminish, and destroy, both the legislative and judicial authority of the United States. 757] First. Let us enquire how the judicial power will effect an extension of the legislative authority. Perhaps the judicial power will not be able, by direct and positive decrees, ever to direct the legislature, because it is not easy to conceive how a question can be brought before them in a course of legal discussion, in which they can give a decision, declaring, that the legislature have certain powers which they have not exercised, and which, in consequence of the determination of the judges, they will be bound to exercise. But it is easy to see, that in their adjudications they may establish certain principles, which being received by the legislature, will enlarge the sphere of their power beyond all bounds. It is to be observed, that the supreme court has the power, in the last resort, to determine all questions that may arise in the course of legal discussion, on the meaning and construction of the constitution. This power they will hold under the constitution, and independent of the legislature. The latter can no more deprive the former of this right, than either of them, or both of them together, can take from the president, with the advice of the senate, the power of making treaties, or appointing ambassadors. In determining these questions, the court must and will assume certain principles, from which they will reason, in forming their decisions. These principles, whatever they may be, when they become fixed, by a course of decisions, will be adopted by the legislature, and will be the rule by which they will explain their own powers. This appears evident from this consideration, that if the legislature pass laws, which, in the judgment of the court, they are not authorised to do by the constitution, the court will not take notice of them; for it will not be denied, that the constitution is the highest or supreme law. And the courts are vested with the supreme and uncontroulable power, to determine, in all cases that come before them, what the constitution means; they cannot, therefore, execute a law, which, in their judgment, opposes the constitution, unless we can suppose they can make a superior law give way to an inferior. The legislature, therefore, will not go over the limits by which the courts may adjudge they are confined. And there is little room to doubt but that they will come up to those bounds, as often as occasion and opportunity may offer, and they may judge it proper to do it. For as on the one hand, they will not readily pass laws which they know the courts will not execute, so on the other, we may be sure they will not scruple to pass such as they know they will give effect, as often as they may judge it proper. From these observations it appears, that the judgment of the judicial, on the constitution, will become the rule to guide the legislature in their construction of their powers. [758] What the principles are, which the courts will adopt, it is impossible for us to say; but taking up the powers as I have explained them in my last number, which they will possess under this clause, it is not difficult to see, that they may, and probably will, be very liberal ones. We have seen, that they will be authorized to give the constitution a construction according to its spirit and reason, and not to confine themselves to its letter. To discover the spirit of the constitution, it is of the first importance to attend to the principal ends and designs it has in view. These are expressed in the preamble, in the following words, viz. “We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution,” &c. If the end of the government is to be learned from these words, which are clearly designed to declare it, it is obvious it has in view every object which is embraced by any government. The preservation of internal peace—the due administration of justice—and to provide for the defence of the community, seems to include all the objects of government; but if they do not, they are certainly comprehended in the words, “to provide for the general welfare.” If it be further considered, that this constitution, if it is ratified, will not be a compact entered into by states, in their corporate capacities, but an agreement of the people of the United States, as one great body politic, no doubt can remain, but that the great end of the constitution, if it is to be collected from the preamble, in which its end is declared, is to constitute a government which is to extend to every case for which any government is instituted, whether external or internal. The courts, therefore, will establish this as a principle in expounding the constitution, and will give every part of it such an explanation, as will give latitude to every department under it, to take cognizance of every matter, not only that affects the general and national concerns of the union, but also of such as relate to the administration of private justice, and to regulating the internal and local affairs of the different parts. Such a rule of exposition is not only consistent with the general spirit of the preamble, but it will stand confirmed by considering more minutely the different clauses of it. The first object declared to be in view is, “To form a perfect union.” It is to be observed, it is not an union of states or bodies corporate; had this been the case the existence of the state governments, might have been secured. But it is a union of the people of the United States considered as one body, who are to ratify this constitution, if it is [759]adopted. Now to make a union of this kind perfect, it is necessary to abolish all inferior governments, and to give the general one compleat legislative, executive and judicial powers to every purpose. The courts therefore will establish it as a rule in explaining the constitution. To give it such a construction as will best tend to perfect the union or take from the state governments every power of either making or executing laws. The second object is “to establish justice.” This must include not only the idea of instituting the rule of justice, or of making laws which shall be the measure or rule of right, but also of providing for the application of this rule or of administering justice under it. And under this the courts will in their decisions extend the power of the government to all cases they possibly can, or otherwise they will be restricted in doing what appears to be the intent of the constitution they should do, to wit, pass laws and provide for the execution of them, for the general distribution of justice between man and man. Another end declared is “to insure domestic tranquility.” This comprehends a provision against all private breaches of the peace, as well as against all public commotions or general insurrections; and to attain the object of this clause fully, the government must exercise the power of passing laws on these subjects, as well as of appointing magistrates with authority to execute them. And the courts will adopt these ideas in their expositions. I might proceed to the other clause, in the preamble, and it would appear by a consideration of all of them separately, as it does by taking them together, that if the spirit of this system is to be known from its declared end and design in the preamble, its spirit is to subvert and abolish all the powers of the state government, and to embrace every object to which any government extends. As it sets out in the preamble with this declared intention, so it proceeds in the different parts with the same idea. Any person, who will peruse the 8th section with attention, in which most of the powers are enumerated, will perceive that they either expressly or by implication extend to almost every thing about which any legislative power can be employed. But if this equitable mode of construction is applied to this part of the constitution; nothing can stand before it. This will certainly give the first clause in that article a construction which I confess I think the most natural and grammatical one, to authorise the Congress to do any thing which in their judgment will tend to provide for the general welfare, and this amounts to the same thing as general and unlimited powers of legislation in all cases. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,2/14/1788,"(Continued from last Thursday’s paper.) This same manner of explaining the constitution, will fix a meaning, and a very important one too, to the 12th clause of the same section, which authorises the Congress to make all laws which shall be proper and necessary for carrying into effect the foregoing powers, &c. A voluminous writer in favor of this system, has taken great pains to convince the public, that this clause means nothing: for that the same powers expressed in this, are implied in other parts of the constitution.2 [774]Perhaps it is so, but still this will undoubtedly be an excellent auxilliary to assist the courts to discover the spirit and reason of the constitution, and when applied to any and every of the other clauses granting power, will operate powerfully in extracting the spirit from them. I might instance a number of clauses in the constitution, which, if explained in an equitable manner, would extend the powers of the government to every case, and reduce the state legislatures to nothing; but, I should draw out my remarks to an undue length, and I presume enough has been said to shew, that the courts have sufficient ground in the exercise of this power, to determine, that the legislature have no bounds set to them by this constitution, by any supposed right the legislatures of the respective states may have, to regulate any of their local concerns. I proceed, 2d, To inquire, in what manner this power will increase the jurisdiction of the courts. I would here observe, that the judicial power extends, expressly, to all civil cases that may arise save such as arise between citizens of the same state, with this exception to those of that description, that the judicial of the United States have cognizance of cases between citizens of the same state, claiming lands under grants of different states. Nothing more, therefore, is necessary to give the courts of law, under this constitution, complete jurisdiction of all civil causes, but to comprehend cases between citizens of the same state not included in the foregoing exception. I presume there will be no difficulty in accomplishing this. Nothing more is necessary than to set forth, in the process, that the party who brings the suit is a citizen of a different state from the one against whom the suit is brought, & there can be little doubt but that the court will take cognizance of the matter, & if they do, who is to restrain them? Indeed, I will freely confess, that it is my decided opinion, that the courts ought to take cognizance of such causes, under the powers of the constitution. For one of the great ends of the constitution is, “to establish justice.” This supposes that this cannot be done under the existing governments of the states; and there is certainly as good reason why individuals, living in the same state, should have justice, as those who live in different states. Moreover, the constitution expressly declares, that “the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.” It will therefore be no fiction, for a citizen of one state to set forth, in a suit, that he is a citizen of another; for he that is entitled to all the privileges and immunities of a country, is a citizen of that country. And in truth, the [775]citizen of one state will, under this constitution, be a citizen of every state. But supposing that the party, who alledges that he is a citizen of another state, has recourse to fiction in bringing in his suit, it is well known, that the courts have high authority to plead, to justify them in suffering actions to be brought before them by such fictions. In my last number3 I stated, that the court of exchequer tried all causes in virtue of such a fiction. The court of king’s bench, in England, extended their jurisdiction in the same way. Originally, this court held pleas, in civil cases, only of trespasses and other injuries alledged to be committed vi et armis.4 They might likewise, says Blackstone, upon the division of the aula regia,5 have originally held pleas of any other civil action whatsoever (except in real actions which are now very seldom in use) provided the defendant was an officer of the court, or in the custody of the marshall or prison-keeper of this court, for breach of the peace, &c. In process of time, by a fiction, this court began to hold pleas of any personal action whatsoever; it being surmised, that the defendant has been arrested for a supposed trespass that “he has never committed, and being thus in the custody of the marshall of the court, the plaintiff is at liberty to proceed against him, for any other personal injury: which surmise of being in the marshall’s custody, the defendant is not at liberty to dispute.” By a much less fiction, may the pleas of the courts of the United States extend to cases between citizens of the same state. I shall add no more on this head, but proceed briefly to remark, in what way this power will diminish and destroy both the legislative and judicial authority of the states. It is obvious that these courts will have authority to decide upon the validity of the laws of any of the states, in all cases where they come in question before them. Where the constitution gives the general government exclusive jurisdiction, they will adjudge all laws made by the states, in such cases, void ab initio.6 Where the constitution gives them concurrent jurisdiction, the laws of the United States must prevail, because they are the supreme law. In such cases, therefore, the laws of the state legislatures must be repealed, restricted, or so construed, as to give full effect to the laws of the union on the same subject. From these remarks it is easy to see, that in proportion as the general government acquires power and jurisdiction, by the liberal construction which the judges may give the constitution, will those of the states lose its rights, until they become so trifling and unimportant, as not to be worth having. I am much mistaken, if this system will not operate to effect this with as much celerity, as those who have the administration [776]of it will think prudent to suffer it. The remaining objections to the judicial power shall be considered in a future paper."
Newspaper,No,A Countryman (I),,New York Journal,,2/14/1788,"Letters from a Gentleman in Dutchess-County to his friend in New-York (Continued from this Register of the 22d ult.)2 Dear Sir, The pamphlets which you sent me, I have read, and, agreeably to what I proposed, in my first letter, will offer you, by way of return, for your politeness and friendship, some of the observations which occurred to me, when I read them. Wherever you think me wrong, I beg your correction, when business permits; as I have nothing in view but the truth, and that I ever wish to avow, let who will be opposed to it. Though I can not subscribe to the whole of the Federal Farmer; yet, I think he has great merit, and well deserves the thanks of his country. But, if I mistake not, he seems at the latter end of the 3d page and beginning of the 4th, to lay rather too much stress on Mr. Pope’s maxim, which is, that, “that which is best administered, is best.”3 With the greatest deference for the Foederal Farmer’s good sense, I beg leave to ask, whether this jingling maxim will not militate as much for the worst form of government, as for the best? From the candour which every where appears in his letters, I think, that I may venture to presume on his answering this question, if answered at all, in the affirmative. However, should I, in this, be wrong, I will as readily acknowledge the error, as ask the question. And, if so, what matter whether the form of government be good or bad, if it be but well administered? Besides, if Mr. Pope’s mode of reasoning be just, why find fault with the constitution proposed, before it is put to the test; for who can tell, previous to its being administered, but it may, according to the poet’s logic, be the best? Hence, does it not clearly appear how dangerous it is, to adopt the opinion or sentiments of any man, or number of men, however sanctioned by time, or the reputed wisdom, &c. of the author [777]or authors, without first thoroughly canvassing the principles, and considering the consequences? Perhaps, to a theocracy or divine government; that is, a government instituted and administered by the immediate interposition of the almighty, the poet’s maxim may, with more consistency, be applied. In which, whatever is of divine institution, or administration, is certainly best. But, I believe it is not pretended by any body, unless it be by the mad doctor, in Philadelphia, that the proffered constitution is of divine descent;4 or, if it be, it is rather too nearly related to the divine right of kings, to be worshipped by true republicans, who enjoy the proper use of their reason. Why then adopt that which may as readily lead to error, as to truth? As the letter writer appears to be a gentleman of true philanthropy, as well as of a clear and comprehensive understanding, I am bound to believe, that it is something, which, from an early adoption, or much use, has become very familiar to him, and, that he did not, at the time, attend to all its consequences. Neither is this any thing uncommon, or peculiar to him, as it undoubtedly has gone through the hands of thousands, before his; and, I imagine, almost every person may, at times, discover something or other of the kind, the absurdity of which, either from much use, or an early adoption, as mentioned above, has become so familiar or sanctioned by custom and time, as not to excite attention, and that too often in spiritual as well as temporal concerns. At the bottom of the 15th page and top of the 16th, are these words, “I wish the system adopted with a few alterations; but those, in my mind, are essential ones; if adopted without, every good citizen will acquiesce, &c.”5 On which, I wish the gentleman had either been more explicit, or silent; as, in the first case, his meaning would have appeared to more advantage, and, in the other, there would have been no necessity for any observation. For, when he says, “if adopted without, every good citizen will acquiesce,” may it not imply, that, “every good citizen,” ought, in duty, or of choice to “acquiesce,” or that “every good citizen must of, or from, necessity “acquiesce?” However, I imagine, that, from the epithet—“good citizen,” the former construction may fairly be put on the phrase; that is, that it will, of course, be the duty or choice of every good citizen to acquiesce, even if the constitution should be adopted without any alteration. Now, if this be truly the gentleman’s meaning, and I can not, as I said above, at present, fairly put any other on it—I must deny his position. Nay, does not he, himself, tacitly deny it, when he says, that the alterations which he wished made, “are essential ones?” For, if they are [778]really essential, according to the true sense of the word, will it not be rather difficult to prove, that it is the duty of a good citizen to acquiesce, in the manner represented, in what is essentially wrong? Should it be said, that no more is meant by the word “acquiesce,” than “a peaceable submission,” I then say, that there was no necessity for mentioning the quality of the citizen; it being as much the duty of a bad citizen, as a good one, to acquiesce, perhaps, more requisite to be inculcated to the bad, than the good. And, should the constitution be adopted without being essentially amended, I hold it to be the indispensible duty of every citizen, good and bad, not to acquiesce in the devises and institutions of men, which are directly opposite, or repugnant, to the word of god; but, by all and every just and prudent means, continually endeavour to procure a reformation or amendment of every thing which is essentially wrong. In page the 18th, paragraph the 2d, it is said, “The senate is entirely on the federal plan,”6 which to me appears somewhat singular, when each senator is to have one vote. Either I do not comprehend his meaning, or there is a mistake, which ought to be corrected, for, by the present confederation, which is a union of the states, not a consolidation, all the delegates, from a state, have but one vote, and in the state senate, which is on the plan of consolidation, each senator has a vote. In page 38, there is an expression, which does not seem to be altogether consistent with the general tenor of the whole, but, perhaps not worth your notice at this time.7 I ask your pardon for being so tedious on such a trifling affair, seemingly; yet viewed in all their consequences, they appear to me, to be of some import rightly to understand. The fabulous story of Actaeon and his hounds,8 is too often verified in disputes of this sort. If I do not mistake, it frequently so happened, just before the revolution, as well as in the course of the war; and, I think, that I remember seeing several such complaints in the public prints, when you returned to the city, especially of Phocion,9 who then pretended to be as zealous an advocate for the constitution of the state, as Publius is now for the new constitution, of which, in No. 38, he gives but a vague account of what is alluded to in the preceding paragraph, as well as the Federal Farmer.10 Not that I suppose the Federal Farmer to have been intentionally wrong. I do not, I assure you; and I beg, that he will not suspect me of it, let him be who he will, for who he is I know not. There are thousands of words and phrases made use of, and that by the most sensible men and best writers, which will not, in all constructions, bear a close examination; and, if that be the case with such characters as I have mentioned, there can be no doubt but you and he, should it be read by [779]him, may discover such in these very observations: but be that as it may, I expect you will readily agree with me that, it is absolutely requisite to weigh every sentiment of friend as well as foe, before we approve, in such momentous concerns, as these times afford.— As remarkable as the Federal Farmer is for candour and fair reasoning, just so remarkable is the pamphlet, said to be written by P——h W——r, of Philadelphia, for a farrago of falshood and a want of reasoning.11 But I know the man and his creed: I have several of his essays, &c. &c. He is a creature of M——’s and a child of the bank,12 if I may be allowed the phrase. And, had it not been for the pernicious influence of that bank, persuaded I am, that the people of Pennsylvania would not have been precipitated, in the manner they have, into the measures lately adopted by them. Is it not curious enough, that our common friend —— ——, should accuse any man of not being a fair reasoner,13 when the very constitution itself, has not been effected by reason, but in direct opposition to it; and the adoption of it, in Pennsylvania, was carried in the same manner, only with more violence—the other more cunning. I am not entirely destitute of hopes, but that state may yet have another convention on the same subject. It cannot surely be possible, that the great body of the people, when they become fully informed of the perfidious advantage which has been taken of their confidence and credulity, by a few designing men, will patiently suffer themselves to be insulted by an aristocratical junto, and their adherents. No, I think, that they will spurn at the constitution, and the contrivers of it, in that state. And to my no small satisfaction, I observe, that the “Centinel” is perfectly competent, and willing to give them every information that their circumstances may require.14 The Federalist, as he terms himself, or Publius, puts me in mind of some of the gentlemen of the long robe, when hard pushed, in a bad cause, with a rich client. They frequently say a great deal, which does not apply; but yet, if it will not convince the judge nor jury, may, perhaps, help to make them forget some part of the evidence—embarrass their opponent, and make the audience stare, besides encreasing the practice. The Daily Advertiser, of January 17th, contains an extract, which is said to be part of “A letter from the late illustrious president of the general convention, to his friend in Fredricksburgh, Virginia,”15 but which, I do not believe to be his inditing, and for the following reasons:—That, neither the style nor composition, appears to be genuine; besides, several of the expressions are too positive and unguarded for [780]any man of common prudence, and much more so, for a person who has always been considered as eminent for that very qualification. Had such a thing made its appearance in the course of the war, I believe, that the medium of its origination might have been much more rationally accounted for, than it now appears to be. Some time since, I also observed a paragraph in one of the papers, but which, at present, I really cannot tell, intimating, that the president of the late general convention, had consented to serve as a member of the state convention, if chosen for one of the counties in Virginia.16 This, I do not credit; for, though Mr. Wilson17 and some others, consented to become the encomiasts and worshipers of their own image, can there ever be a possibility, that HE, who has given so many unequivocal proofs of his native diffidence and modesty, should now assume quite a contrary style and conduct. I will not believe it—it can never be. Indeed, I sincerely wish, that he had refused to quit his peaceful shade. Nor do I believe that he would again have taken on him a public character, had not a very influential combination been formed, in and by which, every engine has been set to work, and that for the sake of accomplishing the grand desideratum of Mr. Adams’s nobility, the well-born of America, or the United States.18 But, to return to the extract, in which there are two periods, in the first paragraph, that prove too much (if they prove any thing) and, of course, amount to nothing, unless it be the writer’s design. They are these:—“And clear I am, if another federal convention is attempted, that the sentiments of the members will be more discordant, or less accommodating than the last. In fine, they will agree upon no general plan.”19 Now, if it be impossible for all the people of the United States, to form another single convention which shall agree upon any one kind of government (and is not this the obvious import or meaning of the assertion) I should be glad to learn, how the ingenious contriver of this curious extract expected, that thirteen, or even nine different conventions should ever agree to adopt the constitution, unless he intended to apply his “ultima ratio”20 to them? Of late, I have observed several of these spurious extracts, paragraphs, &c. in the papers; but, as they were either anonymous, or the characters not of much consequence, I thought them unworthy of notice.—In this, I am impelled by duty. I am, dear sir, Your most obedient, And very humble servant, A COUNTRYMAN."

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,2/21/1788,"Having in the two preceding numbers,2 examined the nature and tendency of the judicial power, as it respects the explanation of the constitution, I now proceed to the consideration of the other matters, of which it has cognizance.—The next paragraph extends its authority, to all cases, in law and equity, arising under the laws of the United States. This power, as I understand it, is a proper one. The proper province of the judicial power, in any government, is, as I conceive, to declare what is the law of the land. To explain and enforce those laws, which the supreme power or legislature may pass; but not to declare what the powers of the legislature are. I suppose the cases in equity, under the laws, must be so construed, as to give the supreme court not only a legal, but equitable jurisdiction of cases which may be brought before them, or in other words, so, as to give them, not only the powers which are now exercised by our courts of law, but those also, which are now exercised by our court of chancery. If this be the meaning, I have no other objection to the power, than what arises from the undue extension of the legislative power. For, I conceive that the judicial power should be commensurate with the legislative. Or, in other words, the supreme court should have authority to determine questions arising under the laws of the union. The next paragraph which gives a power to decide in law and equity, on all cases arising under treaties, is unintelligible to me. I can readily comprehend what is meant by deciding a case under a treaty. For as treaties will be the law of the land, every person who have rights or privileges secured by treaty, will have aid of the courts of law, in recovering them. But I do not understand, what is meant by equity arising under a treaty. I presume every right which can be claimed under a treaty, must be claimed by virtue of some article or clause contained in it, which gives the right in plain and obvious words; or at least, I conceive, that the rules for explaining treaties, are so well ascertained, that there is no need of having recourse to an equitable construction. If under this power, the courts are to explain treaties, according to what they conceive are their spirit, which is nothing less than a power to give them whatever extension they may judge proper, it is a dangerous and improper power. The cases affecting ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls—of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; controversies to which the United States are a party, and controversies between states, it is proper should be under the cognizance of the courts of the union, [796]because none but the general government, can, or ought to pass laws on their subjects. But, I conceive the clause which extends the power of the judicial to controversies arising between a state and citizens of another state, improper in itself, and will, in its exercise, prove most pernicious and destructive. It is improper, because it subjects a state to answer in a court of law, to the suit of an individual. This is humiliating and degrading to a government, and, what I believe, the supreme authority of no state ever submitted to. The states are now subject to no such actions. All contracts entered into by individuals with states, were made upon the faith and credit of the states, and the individuals never had in contemplation any compulsory mode of obliging the government to fulfil its engagements. The evil consequences that will flow from the exercise of this power, will best appear by tracing it in its operation. The constitution does not direct the mode in which an individual shall commence a suit against a state or the manner in which the judgement of the court shall be carried into execution, but it gives the legislature full power to pass all laws which shall be proper and necessary for the purpose. And they certainly must make provision for these purposes, or otherwise the power of the judicial will be nugatory. For, to what purpose will the power of a judicial be, if they have no mode, in which they can call the parties before them? Or of what use will it be, to call the parties to answer, if after they have given judgment, there is no authority to execute the judgment? We must, therefore, conclude, that the legislature will pass laws which will be effectual in this head. An individual of one state will then have a legal remedy against a state for any demand he may have against a state to which he does not belong. Every state in the union is largely indebted to individuals. For the payment of these debts they have given notes payable to the bearer. At least this is the case in this state. Whenever a citizen of another state becomes possessed of one of these notes, he may commence an action in the supreme court of the general government; and I cannot see any way in which he can be prevented from recovering. It is easy to see, that when this once happens, the notes of the state will pass rapidly from the hands of citizens of the state to those of other states. And when the citizens of other states possess them, they may bring suits against the state for them, and by this means, judgments and executions may be obtained against the state for the whole amount of the state debt. It is certain the state, with the utmost exertions it can make, will not be able to discharge the debt she owes, under a considerable number of years, perhaps with the best management, it will require [797]twenty or thirty years to discharge it. This new system will protract the time in which the ability of the state will enable them to pay off their debt, because all the funds of the state will be transferred to the general government, except those which arise from internal taxes. The situation of the states will be deplorable. By this system, they will surrender to the general government, all the means of raising money, and at the same time, will subject themselves to suits at law, for the recovery of the debts they have contracted in effecting the revolution. The debts of the individual states will amount to a sum, exceeding the domestic debt of the United States; these will be left upon them, with power in the judicial of the general government, to enforce their payment, while the general government will possess an exclusive command of the most productive funds, from which the states can derive money, and a command of every other source of revenue paramount to the authority of any state. It may be said that the apprehension that the judicial power will operate in this manner is merely visionary, for that the legislature will never pass laws that will work these effects. Or if they were disposed to do it, they cannot provide for levying an execution on a state, for where will the officer find property whereon to levy? To this I would reply, if this is a power which will not or cannot be executed, it was useless and unwise to grant it to the judicial. For what purpose is a power given which it is imprudent or impossible to exercise? If it be improper for a government to exercise a power, it is improper they should be vested with it. And it is unwise to authorise a government to do what they cannot effect. As to the idea that the legislature cannot provide for levying an execution on a state, I believe it is not well founded. I presume the last paragraph of the 8th section of article 1, gives the Congress express power to pass any laws they may judge proper and necessary for carrying into execution the power vested in the judicial department. And they must exercise this power, or otherwise the courts of justice will not be able to carry into effect the authorities with which they are invested. For the constitution does not direct the mode in which the courts are to proceed, to bring parties before them, to try causes, or to carry the judgment of the courts into execution. Unless they are pointed out by law, how are they to proceed, in any of the cases of which they have cognizance? They have the same authority to establish regulations in respect to these matters, where a state is a party, as where an individual is a party. The only difficulty is, on whom shall process be served, when a state is a party, and how shall execution be levied. With regard to the first, the way is easy, either the executive or legislative of the state may [798]be notified, and upon proof being made of the service of the notice, the court may proceed to a hearing of the cause. Execution may be levied on any property of the state, either real or personal. The treasury may be seized by the officers of the general government, or any lands the property of the state, may be made subject to seizure and sale to satisfy any judgment against it. Whether the estate of any individual citizen may not be made answerable for the discharge of judgments against the state, may be worth consideration. In some corporations this is the case. If the power of the judicial under this clause will extend to the cases above stated, it will, if executed, produce the utmost confusion, and in its progress, will crush the states beneath its weight. And if it does not extend to these cases, I confess myself utterly at a loss to give it any meaning. For if the citizen of one state, possessed of a written obligation, given in pursuance of a solemn act of the legislature, acknowledging a debt due to the bearer, and promising to pay it, cannot recover in the supreme court, I can conceive of no case in which they can recover. And it appears to me ridiculous to provide for obtaining judgment against a state, without giving the means of levying execution."

Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,2/28/1788,"New York Journal, 28 February 17882 Mr Greenleaf, Be pleased to publish in your patriotic paper the proceedings of the inhabitants of the counties of Ulster and Orange, at a meeting held lately at this place, and you will oblige many customers, and all genuine friends of the liberty of the people. [803] The convention which met at Philadelphia in May last, and which was appointed for the express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and perpetual union of the states, having proposed to the people an entire new plan of government; and the legislature of the state having passed certain resolutions, advising a method of electing deputies to form a convention, to meet for the purpose of considering the said constitution or plan of government, the inhabitants of the county of Ulster and Orange, conceived it to be their duty and privilege to assemble, in order to consult upon a subject appearing to them important, as affecting not only their immediate interest, but also the liberty of their country, which they have upon many occasions given the most decisive proofs that they esteem far more valuable; and although no general notice was given, a very considerable body of respectable inhabitants3 assembled at this place on Thursday last; when Hendrick Smith was appointed moderator, and after reading and considering the proposed constitution the question was stated, whether they would consent to adopt the plan of government, published by the convention—and every one present declared that they would not;4 but on the contrary, oppose it as a system calculated to destroy that equal liberty, which they now enjoy, and which is secured by the happy constitution and government which has been established at the expence of the blood and treasure of so many worthy citizens; and to manifest their disapprobation of the scheme and opinion of its pernicious tendency, they caused the said constitution to be burnt in the most public place of the town, with the usual circumstances of disrespect and contempt. Notwithstanding the great number of persons present upon the occasion, the proceedings were conducted with unanimity and good order, and every one appeared to be impressed with a sense of the importance of the subject, and alarmed by the prospect of those calamities which, it is to be feared, this happy country will soon be involved in, by the machinations of the anti-republican party, which have so lately discovered themselves in different parts of the continent. Montgomery, Ulster county, State of New-York, Feb. 9. 1788."
Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,2/28/1788,"The second paragraph of sect. 2d. art. 3, is in these words: “In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have [821]original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.” Although it is proper that the courts of the general government should have cognizance of all matters affecting ambassadors, foreign ministers, and consuls; yet I question much the propriety of giving the supreme court original jurisdiction in all cases of this kind. Ambassadors, and other public ministers, claim, and are entitled by the law of nations, to certain privileges, and exemptions, both for their persons and their servants. The meanest servant of an ambassador is exempted by the law of nations from being sued for debt. Should a suit be brought against such an one by a citizen, through inadvertency or want of information, he will be subject to an action in the supreme court. All the officers concerned in issuing or executing the process will be liable to like actions. Thus may a citizen of a state be compelled, at great expence and inconveniency, to defend himself against a suit, brought against him in the supreme court, for inadvertently commencing an action against the most menial servant of an ambassador for a just debt. The appellate jurisdiction granted to the supreme court, in this paragraph, has justly been considered as one of the most objectionable parts of the constitution: under this power, appeals may be had from the inferior courts to the supreme, in every case to which the judicial power extends, except in the few instances in which the supreme court will have original jurisdiction. By this article, appeals will lie to the supreme court, in all criminal as well as civil causes. This I know, has been disputed by some; but I presume the point will appear clear to any one, who will attend to the connection of this paragraph with the one that precedes it. In the former, all the cases, to which the power of the judicial shall extend, whether civil or criminal, are enumerated. There is no criminal matter, to which the judicial power of the United States will extend; but such as are included under some one of the cases specified in this section. For this section is extended to define all the cases, of every description, to which the power of the judicial shall reach. But in all these cases it is declared, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, except in those which affect ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party. If then this section extends the power of the judicial, to criminal cases, it allows appeals in such cases. If the power of the judicial is not extended to criminal matters [822]by this section, I ask, by what part of this system does it appear, that they have any cognizance of them? I believe it is a new and unusual thing to allow appeals in criminal matters. It is contrary to the sense of our laws, and dangerous to the lives and liberties of the citizen. As our law now stands, a person charged with a crime has a right to a fair and impartial trial by a jury of his country, and their verdict is final. If he is acquitted no other court can call upon him to answer for the same crime. But by this system, a man may have had ever so fair a trial, have been acquitted by ever so respectable a jury of his country; and still the officer of the government who prosecutes, may appeal to the supreme court. The whole matter may have a second hearing. By this means, persons who may have disobliged those who execute the general government, may be subjected to intolerable oppression. They may be kept in long and ruinous confinement, and exposed to heavy and insupportable charges, to procure the attendence of witnesses, and provide the means of their defence, at a great distance from their places of residence. I can scarcely believe there can be a considerate citizen of the United States, that will approve of this appellate jurisdiction, as extending to criminal cases, if they will give themselves time for reflection. Whether the appellate jurisdiction as it respects civil matters, will not prove injurious to the rights of the citizens, and destructive of those privileges which have ever been held sacred by Americans, and whether it will not render the administration of justice intolerably burthensome, intricate, and dilatory, will best appear, when we have considered the nature and operation of this power. It has been the fate of this clause, as it has of most of those, against which unanswerable objections have been offered, to be explained different ways, by the advocates and opponents to the constitution. I confess I do not know what the advocates of the system, would make it mean, for I have not been fortunate enough to see in any publication this clause taken up and considered. It is certain however, they do not admit the explanation which those who oppose the constitution give it, or otherwise they would not so frequently charge them with want of candor, for alledging that it takes away the trial by jury, appeals from an inferior to a superior court, as practised in the civil law courts, are well understood. In these courts, the judges determine both on the law and the fact; and appeals are allowed from the inferior to the superior courts, on the whole merits: the superior tribunal will re-examine all the facts as well as the law, and frequently new facts will be introduced, so as many times to render the cause in the court of appeals very different from what it was in the court below. If the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court, be understood in the above sense, the term is perfectly intelligible. The meaning then is, that in all the civil causes enumerated, the supreme court shall have authority to re-examine the whole merits of the case, both with respect to the facts and the law which may arise under it, without the intervention of a jury; that this is the sense of this part of the system appears to me clear, from the express words of it, “in all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, &c.” Who are the supreme court? Does it not consist of the judges? and they are to have the same jurisdiction of the fact as they are to have of the law. They will therefore have the same authority to determine the fact as they will have to determine the law, and no room is left for a jury on appeals to the supreme court. If we understand the appellate jurisdiction in any other way, we shall be left utterly at a loss to give it a meaning; the common law is a stranger to any such jurisdiction: no appeals can lie from any of our common law courts, upon the merits of the case; the only way in which they can go up from an inferior to a superior tribunal is by habeas corpus before a hearing, or by certiorari, or writ of error, after they are determined in the subordinate courts; but in no case, when they are carried up, are the facts re-examined, but they are always taken as established in the inferior court. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Expositor,,New York Journal,,2/28/1788,"Article 1st.—Section ii. and clause the 4th. [“]When vacancies happen in the representation from any state, the executive thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.” It seems, by this clause, as if two or three rights had been intended for somebody, but, by an unhappy laconism or two, they do not quite so clearly appear for whom they were designed, as might have been expected, from the focus of conventional erudition, &c. But great minds, it is said, are above composition, as well as ceremony, and, if so, perhaps that may be the apology. However that be, “the executive thereof” may, and that according to no uncommon construction, relate to “representation” as well as to “state.” And “writs of election to fill such vacancies,” not only may intend, but will scarcely bear any other construction than, that “such vacancies” are to be filled with those [824]“writs of election,” instead of proper persons. But, at all events, it looks a little like a conge de lire, or sovereign permission, for the executive of something to issue “writs of election” for some purpose. Suppose it had been said, that “the executive of the state, in which the vacancy happens, shall issue writs of election,” authorizing “suitable or proper person or persons, as the case might require, to be legally chosen, for filling such vacancy or vacancies,” would the uncertainty or ambiguity of the clause have been greater than it now is? Clause 5th. “The house of representatives shall choose their speaker, and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.” The house’s right to choose it’s own speaker, and other officers, appears to be pretty well defined; but, if I mistake not, “the sole power of impeachment” may be construed to exclude all other impeachments, by any of the state legislatures, or any other body of men whatever, in the United States; which, if it should, may it not produce a right of infinite mal-administration, in every department? Nor is this opinion singular, as I observe, that Mr. Nicolson, of Philadelphia, in his “View of the proposed constitution,” entertains exactly the same idea of it.2 Besides, to what does it amount? Why, nothing but mere illusion, as all impeachments are to be tried by the very persons who appoint, or, at least, have an essential influence in appointing, to every office; if we except that of president and vice-president, under the constitution, as will more fully appear. Section 3d, clause 1st. “The senate of the United States, shall be composed of two senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years; and each senator shall have one vote.” Is this last mentioned right, a right of confederation or consolidation? But, besides this, and the other apparent rights here exhibited, there are several very important one’s involved in this senatorial clause, to wit, the right of pre-emption to as much of the western territory as the senate and assembly, in conjunction with the president, can agree to divide among them. To which, also, may be added, the right of procuring enough of it for their friends, in the different legislatures and states, to secure their being re-chosen, at the expiration of their respective classical terms; that is, at the end of two, four, and six years, as there is no provision made against their being continued for life; and of course, continuing their friends or families in office, let them be ever so disagreeable to the people, or behave as they may; for the [825]senate have the sole right of trying all impeachments—perhaps in the United States—you will please to observe, sir. Clause 2d. “Immediately after they shall be assembled, in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three classes. The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration of the sixth year; so that one third may be chosen every second year; and if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments, until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.” Besides some part of the exposition, on clause the fourth, sect. 2d. which applies equally to this, as it does to that, here seems to be the right of playing see-saw. Why not have said, in the preceding clause, “for a term of years not exceeding six, nor less than two, according as they may be classed, &c.?” Where is the necessity or propriety of saying, “for six years,” absolutely, and, almost with the very next breath, as it were, declare, that a majority of them, or two thirds, shall not continue so long? It is observed, that, “one third may be chosen every second year,” &c. To which, with great truth, might have been added, or “rechosen as often as places, pensions, &c. have any influence.” Should any of the advocates for the proffered constitution, assert, that the subject of some of the remarks and observations, made on their favourite hopes, is trifling, and such as might have escaped the notice of others as well as the convention, let them reflect, for a moment, to what a height they raised the expectations of many of the friends to just and equal freedom, by their endless panegyrics on the effulgence of the most profound erudition, wisdom, and all other mental abilities and acquirements, which they declared to be wholly concentred in the convention: and then say, whether the style, composition, &c. of this long-laboured production, be really adequate to their own description of its authors capacities? Clause 3d. “No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.” Much the same observation which was made on the second clause of the second section, will apply to this. However, if any number of [826]years must be the criterion of patience, perseverance, equanimity, good sense, intuitive discernment, and sound judgement, why adopt one inferior to the adage, which says, that “a man, at forty, is either a fool, or a physician.” As, in that case, it might be evident which side he had chosen? And, why not provide against the frigidity and imbecilities of old age, as well as against the versatility and ardour of youth, I should be glad to learn? Are not several of the effects of old age as incompatible with the office or duty of a good legislator as some of the levities or follies of youth? Clause 4th. “The vice president of the United States shall be president of the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.” And if he had never been mentioned, he would never have been wanted, unless for pride and senatorial dignity; as will presently be shown by the next clause, and the observations on it. Neither is this puny clause without its perspicuity; but where so many greater appear, perhaps it may now be worthy of notice. Yet, is there not something preposterous in this manner of ascertaining the right of the vice president, previous to his having been once mentioned? Why not first declare, as in clause the first, of the first article, on legislative powers, that there should be a president and vice-president, and then ascertain their right of administration, &c.? Clause 5th. “The senate shall choose their other officers, and also a president pro tempore, in the absence of the vice-president, or when he shall exercise the office of president of the United States.” And does not this plainly shew, that there was no real necessity for a “vice-president,” as “president of the senate,” unless for parade ostentation and expence, or giving some one state an advantage, and, perhaps, one which may be the least entitled to it, or which, in point of good policy, ought not to have such an advantage in the national councils?—as the senate could, with as much propriety as the house of representatives, always choose one of their own house to preside, which, at present, would also preserve a casting vote in their proceedings, in case the whole senate were present. And, as to the office of president, of the United States, that could also be exercised, pro-tempore, by the same person; that is, the president of the senate, chosen, as mentioned above, until another regular choice could be made. May not the epithet, “other officers,” in this and a preceding clause, admit, like “the wife of Anthony, an army for an usher?”3 Clause 6th. “The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When setting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. When the president of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside; and no person shall be convicted, without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.” On the first of these rights or powers, Mr. Nicolson puts the following very pertinent question. “Is it meant, that the several states should hereby be restrained from trying their own officers, impeached for maladministration?”4 On the right of swearing, he asks, and not without reason,—“What are they to swear or affirm?”5—And, on—“When the president of the United States is tried, the chief justice shall preside:”—he facetiously and justly inquires—“Is it meant, at the senate or in the United States?”6 i. e. that the chief justice is to preside, for, it is not said at, or in which, by this part of the constitution, his presidency is to take place. To these, I beg leave to add another, which is—Whether it be of more consequence to screen the officers of the new government, than to protect the people, who must support them and the government? If I may be allowed the privilege of a financier; that is, to anticipate, I will answer this question in the affirmative, and offer some part of the second clause of the second section, in the third article, in support of the assertion. For, it is there said—“In all other cases before-mentioned,” that is, all mentioned in the two preceding clauses, which, in fact, includes almost every case, in which the people can be concerned—“The supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact.” Now, by comparing this with the preceding clause, must it not either be supposed, that the decisions of the supreme court (which perhaps, may not often consist of more than four; but frequently of three, two, and sometimes one, and yet that one, alone, may be the sole judge of law and fact, in deciding for the people) will be more equitable and just, than those of the senate, who are to be on oath, as well as the supreme court, and of whom there must be two thirds, which are, if of a full senate, sixteen, rejecting the fractional number, and that for only the removal from office, &c. whilst a single voice or so may consign a farmer, mechanic, or merchant, &c. to endless imprisonment, or inevitable ruin—Or that it was considered by the convention to be a matter of much more consequence to screen one officer of the intended government, than to protect the great body of the people, by a fair and open trial of the vicinage, which is their indubitable birth-right, and, for which, they so nobly contended and bravely conquered? How invidious! and, of course, how humiliating and [828]degrading a subject of reflection must this ever be to all, but those in administration! Gracious Alfred! how would thy divine spirit have revolted at such rights as these! THOU alone, who, whilst invested with sovereignty—didst, out of thine own mere clemency, and for the sake of perpetuating distributive justice to thy subjects and their posterity—institute the trial by jury and of the vicinage!7 What a contrast to the modern invention of a number of fellow citizens! Peace be to thy holy manes, there are other rights, not far hence, which, if possible, are enough to disturb thy sacred rest! Clause the 7th. “Judgment in cases of impeachment, shall not extend farther than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit, under the United States; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.” This may do to gull the unwary. But where is the law? Why, like the “oath or affirmation,” and “vice-president”—it is not known, and when it is, if we may judge from what we see, it will be a mere cobweb to catch the little flies, and let the large go through. Section 4th. Clause 1st  “The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof: but Congress may at any time, by law, make, or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing senators.” Here then is a right, which nearly threw one of the warmest advocates for the proffered constitution into a consternation, and obliged him to confess judgment against that right, which the convention must have thought to be a very essential one, or they would scarcely have made such a grasp at it. And, it seems to me, as if nothing produced the exception, but the senators being chosen by the legislatures, who, it was thought, would hardly consent to go the grand rounds, and that only for the sake of choosing two senators a piece, as Congress might, in the plenitude of their power, see fit to direct. Yet, you Federalists, as you call yourselves, complain of the constitution as not containing sufficient rights! Perhaps, if it had contained many more such, they might have caused as solemn a pause in you, as this did in the examiner of it. For, “here,” says he, “let us pause. What did the convention mean by giving Congress power to make regulations prescribed by the legislatures? Is this expression accurate or intelligible?”—Which, it is imagined may very safely be answered in the negative; as it does not appear to be either accurate or intelligible. For, [829]how can Congress make such regulations as are prescribed by the legislatures; unless it be meant, that Congress may make exactly such others, which would be very curious indeed?—“But,” continues the same writer, who, as mentioned above, is a most zealous advocate for the new government; and supposed to be P——h W——r, of Philadelphia.—“The word alter, is very intelligible, and the clause puts the election of representatives wholly, and the senators almost wholly in the power of Congress.”—He likewise adds “I see no occasion for any power in Congress, to interfere with the choice of their own body.” “But the clause in Italics, gives needless and dangerous powers. I hope the states will reject it with decency, and adopt the whole without altering another syllable.”8—Without stopping to notice this gentleman’s contradiction in terms, there are several other parts of the constitution, which require pausing at, equally with the part he alluded to; that is, Congress making what the legislatures prescribe, &c. Clause 2d. “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.” As here seems to be no provision for the right of non-user, what if invasion or insurrection should prevent—“such meeting?”"

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,3/6/1788,"(Continued.) It may still be insisted that this clause does not take away the trial by jury on appeals, but that this may be provided for by the legislature, under that paragraph which authorises them to form regulations and restrictions for the court in the exercise of this power. The natural meaning of this paragraph seems to be no more than this, that Congress may declare, that certain cases shall not be subject to the appellate jurisdiction, and they may point out the mode in which the court shall proceed in bringing up the causes before them, the manner of their taking evidence to establish the facts, and the method of the courts proceeding. But I presume they cannot take from the court the right of deciding on the fact, any more than they can deprive them of the right of determining on the law, when a cause is once before them; for they have the same jurisdiction as to fact, as they have as to the law. But supposing the Congress may under this clause establish the trial by jury on appeals. It does not seem to me that it will render this article much less exceptionable. An appeal from one court and jury, to another court and jury, is a thing altogether unknown in the laws of our state, and in most of the states in the union. A practice of this kind prevails in the eastern states; actions are there commenced in the inferior courts, and an appeal lies from them on the whole merits to the superior courts: the consequence is well known, very few actions are determined in the lower courts; it is rare that a case of any importance is not carried by appeal to the supreme court, and the jurisdiction of the inferior courts is merely nominal; this has proved so burthen-some to the people in Massachusetts, that it was one of the principal causes which excited the insurrection in that state, in the year past;2 very few sensible and moderate men in that state but what will admit, that the inferior courts are almost entirely useless, and answer very little purpose, save only to accumulate costs against the poor debtors who are already unable to pay their just debts. But the operation of the appellate power in the supreme judicial of the United States, would work infinitely more mischief than any such power can do in a single state. The trouble and expence to the parties would be endless and intolerable. No man can say where the supreme court are to hold their sessions, the presumption is, however, that it must be at the seat of the general government: in this case parties must travel many hundred [848]miles, with their witnesses and lawyers, to prosecute or defend a suit; no man of midling fortune, can sustain the expence of such a law suit, and therefore the poorer and midling class of citizens will be under the necessity of submitting to the demands of the rich and the lordly, in cases that will come under the cognizance of this court. If it be said, that to prevent this oppression, the supreme court will set in different parts of the union, it may be replied, that this would only make the oppression somewhat more tolerable, but by no means so much as to give a chance of justice to the poor and midling class. It is utterly impossible that the supreme court can move into so many different parts of the Union, as to make it convenient or even tolerable to attend before them with witnesses to try causes from every part of the United states; if to avoid the expence and inconvenience of calling witnesses from a great distance, to give evidence before the supreme court, the expedient of taking the deposition of witnesses in writing should be adopted, it would not help the matter. It is of great importance in the distribution of justice that witnesses should be examined face to face, that the parties should have the fairest opportunity of cross examining them in order to bring out the whole truth; there is something in the manner in which a witness delivers his testimony which cannot be committed to paper, and which yet very frequently gives a complexion to his evidence, very different from what it would bear if committed to writing, besides the expence of taking written testimony would be enormous; those who are acquainted with the costs that arise in the courts, where all the evidence is taken in writing, well know that they exceed beyond all comparison those of the common law courts, where witnesses are examined viva voce. The costs accruing in courts generally advance with the grade of the court; thus the charges attending a suit in our common pleas, is much less than those in the supreme court, and these are much lower than those in the court of chancery; indeed the costs in the last mentioned court, are in many cases so exorbitant and the proceedings so dilatory that the suitor had almost as well give up his demand as to prosecute his suit. We have just reason to suppose, that the costs in the supreme general court will exceed either of our courts; the officers of the general court will be more dignified than those of the states, the lawyers of the most ability will practice in them, and the trouble and expence of attending them will be greater. From all these considerations, it appears, that the expence attending suits in the supreme court will be so great, as to put it out of the power of the poor and midling class of citizens to contest a suit in it. From these remarks it appears, that the administration of justice under [849]the powers of the judicial will be dilatory; that it will be attended with such an heavy expence as to amount to little short of a denial of justice to the poor and middling class of people who in every government stand most in need of the protection of the law; and that the trial by jury, which has so justly been the boast of our fore fathers as well as ourselves is taken away under them. These extraordinary powers in this court are the more objectionable, because there does not appear the least necessity for them, in order to secure a due and impartial distribution of justice. The want of ability or integrity, or a disposition to render justice to every suitor, has not been objected against the courts of the respective states: so far as I have been informed, the courts of justice in all the states, have ever been found ready, to administer justice with promptitude and impartiality according to the laws of the land; It is true in some of the states, paper money has been made, and the debtor authorised to discharge his debts with it, at a depreciated value, in others, tender laws have been passed, obliging the creditor to receive on execution other property than money in discharge of his demand, and in several of the states laws have been made unfavorable to the creditor and tending to render property insecure. But these evils have not happened from any defect in the judicial departments of the states; the courts indeed are bound to take notice of these laws, and so will the courts of the general government be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature; not repugnant to the constitution; but so far have the judicial been from giving undue latitude of construction to laws of this kind, that they have invariably strongly inclined to the other side. All the acts of our legislature, which have been charged with being of this complexion, have uniformly received the strictest construction by the judges, and have been extended to no cases but to such as came within the strict letter of the law. In this way, have our courts, I will not say evaded the law, but so limited it in its operation as to work the least possible injustice: the same thing has taken place in Rhode-Island, which has justly rendered herself infamous, by her tenaciously adhering to her paper money system. The judges there gave a decision, in opposition to the words of the Statute, on this principle, that a construction according to the words of it, would contradict the fundamental maxims of their laws and constitution.3 No pretext therefore, can be formed, from the conduct of the judicial courts which will justify giving such powers to the supreme general court, for their decisions have been such as to give just ground of confidence in them, that they will firmly adhere to the principles of rectitude, [850]and there is no necessity of lodging these powers in the courts, in order to guard against the evils justly complained of, on the subject of security of property under this constitution. For it has provided, “that no state shall emit bills of credit, or make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.” It has also declared, that “no state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.”—These prohibitions give the most perfect security against those attacks upon property which I am sorry to say some of the states have but too wantonly made, by passing laws sanctioning fraud in the debtor against his creditor. For “this constitution will be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state will be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution and laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” The courts of the respective states might therefore have been securely trusted, with deciding all cases between man and man, whether citizens of the same state or of different states, or between foreigners and citizens, and indeed for ought I see every case that can arise under the constitution or laws of the United States, ought in the first instance to be tried in the court of the state, except those which might arise between states, such as respect ambassadors, or other public ministers, and perhaps such as call in question the claim of lands under grants from different states. The state courts would be under sufficient controul, if writs of error were allowed from the state courts to the supreme court of the union, according to the practice of the courts in England and of this state, on all cases in which the laws of the union are concerned, and perhaps to all cases in which a foreigner is a party. This method would preserve the good old way of administering justice, would bring justice to every man’s door, and preserve the inestimable right of trial by jury. It would be following, as near as our circumstances will admit, the practice of the courts in England, which is almost the only thing I would wish to copy in their government. But as this system now stands, there is to be as many inferior courts as Congress may see fit to appoint, who are to be authorised to originate and in the first instance to try all the cases falling under the description of this article; there is no security that a trial by jury shall be had in these courts, but the trial here will soon become, as it is in Massachusetts’ inferior courts, mere matter of form; for an appeal may be had to the supreme court on the whole merits. This court is to have power to determine in law and in equity, on the law and the fact, and this court is exalted above all other power in the government, subject to no controul, and so fixed as not to be removeable, but upon impeachment, which I shall hereafter shew, is much the same thing as not to be removeable at all. [851] To obviate the objections made to the judicial power it has been said, that the Congress, in forming the regulations and exceptions which they are authorised to make respecting the appellate jurisdiction, will make provision against all the evils which are apprehended from this article. On this I would remark, that this way of answering the objection made to the power, implies an admission that the power is in itself improper without restraint, and if so, why not restrict it in the first instance. The just way of investigating any power given to a government, is to examine its operation supposing it to be put in exercise. If upon enquiry, it appears that the power, if exercised, would be prejudicial, it ought not to be given. For to answer objections made to a power given to a government, by saying it will never be exercised, is really admitting that the power ought not to be exercised, and therefore ought not to be granted."

Newspaper,No,A Freeman,,New York Journal,,3/13/1788,"As the important period approaches, when we must decide on the most interesting of subjects, to the liberty, independence and happiness of America, I submit the following characters, with a few observations, as candidates for a seat in convention: ROBERT TROUP, WILLIAM GILBERT ROBERT BOYD, NATHANIEL LAWRENCE, JAMES M. HUGHES, WILLIAM MALCOLM, ISAAC STOUTENBURGH, JOHN RAY, SAMUEL JONES.  On a subject which requires in its judges the best virtues of the heart, with the utmost soundness, penetration, and free agency of the head; the impropriety of delegating men, whose profits, or immediate prospects, are at all affected either way, need not be discanted on. Private loss or gain is ever dangerous, and its workings are, if possible, to be avoided. With this deduction, or even without it, the above list will appear as little exceptionable as any, at least to the candid and dispassionate. The opinions of several of them on the great question, I believe are, as they should be, unknown. They possess the essentials of a general interest, ability, and coolness, if not disinterestedness. The last I fear is not now to be attained, but the others ought by all means to be secured; and this can only be done, by omitting the most violent and ambitious, and preferring others who possess and regard the feelings of the community, and are selected from among them. Great and obvious interest on either side, will excite suspicion and calumny, if it do not warp the judgment and defeat itself. As the above are all moderate men, they will judge coolly and fairly, and act prudently. These are all the real benefits we can justly expect from any other nomination, and will have this signal advantage, that should this state have the luck, or misfortune (for which it will be time must determine) to be obliged to differ and dissent from her sister states, they cannot attribute it to factious or other unworthy motives. But should the friends of liberty be obliged to yield to tyrannical members, which patriotism forbid, their pacific dispositions will best guard us from the horrors of civil war, which Heaven avert from our devoted country."

Broadside,No,Albany Anti-Federal Committee,,,,3/15/1788,"To the Independent Electors, Of the City and County of ALBANY. At a public Meeting of a Number of the Anti-Federalists, inhabitants of most of the districts of the city and county of Albany, who had formed themselves into a Committee for the purpose; the following persons were unanimously nominated to represent the city and county in Convention and Assembly. DELEGATES. Robert Yates, John Lansing, Jun. Henry Oothoudt, Peter Vrooman, Israel Thompson, Anthony Ten Eyck, Dirck Swart. SENATOR for the Western District, Peter Van Ness. ASSEMBLYMEN. John Lansing, Jun. Henry K. Van Rensselaer, Cornelius Van Dyck, John Thompson, John Duncan, Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, John Younglove. In forming the list for Members of Convention, who are to decide on a subject of the utmost importance, as well to ourselves as to posterity, particular attention was paid to exclude from nomination every person, whose very large possessions and intimate connection with a man of the first property in the state, would afford him a hope that, if the government became vested in the hands of a few, his interest would be among the first particularly promoted by it—from a conviction, that [1371]it must be injurious and dangerous to a free people, to send a representative whose situation is so peculiar as to render him little affected by any changes in government, which may abridge the liberties of his fellow citizens.—Every person suspected of being interested in the establishment of a constitution which holds out an impunity for peculation, and a total oblivion for all sins of that nature—persuaded that the same disposition which first prompted an appropriation of the monies entrusted to him, under the sacred sanction of an official oath, would induce a further sacrifice of the dearest rights of mankind, to secure his ill gotten wealth—Every person who has, by the general tenor of his conduct, during a struggle which unmasked the most latent propensities of the mind, evinced that he prefered a disgraceful submission to the yoke of British servitude to a generous effort to shake it off—convinced that the same inclination to support tyranny, or the same imbecility to oppose it, would render him a very improper object for a public trust, of so important and affecting a nature as the one we are now about to devolve—Every person, whose immorality, common habits of blaspheming and swearing, and continual efforts to reduce all characters to a level with his own, induces a presumption, that he is as destitute of principle as of common sense: sincerely impressed with the idea, that the man who blasphemes his God, and malevolently scandalizes his neighbor, cannot be so eminently qualified in other respects, as to prefer him to all the other inhabitants of the county—Every person who, long conversant with military life, has imbibed an opinion and not hesitated to declare, that the WILL of ONE is much preferable to the LIBERTY of ALL—Every person who can submit to have an opinion dictated to him, and will vote as one person, who brought him forward, shall direct:—Knowing that where opinions are given privately and decidedly influence a public conduct, the soundest reason and argument, urged against those opinions, must be unavailing and fruitless—persons not sufficiently qualified to judge and determine on the great and important Business of Government, and persons who have determined first to adopt a defective Constitution, and afterwards, contrary to their own sentiments, affect to depend on a precarious recommendation for future amendments. A Committee of the Anti-Federalists in this city, vouch to the public that, though the Convention of the United States, who were delegated for the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the Confederation,2 have presumed to form an entire new System of Government; and although the Gentlemen nominated for the State Convention, conceive the New Constitution dangerous to the Liberties of the People, they are not averse to the cultivation of a spirit of conciliation; but they are not [1372]disposed to trust to the feeble effects of a recommendation of future amendments, while they have it in their power to make it a condition of accession. The defect of the present Confederation, is no reason for depriving the individual States of their most important rights of sovereignty; nor can it from thence be infered, that we must at all events, adopt a Government more exceptionable—as it will probably leave us no alternative, but that of changing for one which deposites more power in the hands of the few. The consideration that six States (including the three small States of Georgia, New-Jersey, and Delaware, by some Federalists called powerful States) have already adopted it, may be urged to influence us to pursue their example: but two of them have, by the best information, been precipitated into the business—In the others very little time was afforded to deliberate on the important National Question.3 In Massachusetts, the Constitution is adopted; but it appears to have been the sense of a large proportion of its Convention, probably a majority, that amendments were essentially necessary—& that notwithstanding the proposed amendments, they adopted the Constitution by a small majority of only nineteen of near four hundred members.4 In New-Hampshire, the manner of the adjournment leaves it out of doubt, that very few of the Delegates beyond the majority, wanted instructions, as has been asserted, as the question for adjournment was carried by no more than three; and the expedient of an adjournment must have proceeded from a conviction that otherwise the Constitution, if the question had then been decided, would have been rejected.5 But whatever may be the sentiments, whatever the conduct of our brethren in the neighboring States, we are to judge for ourselves; and we hope and believe, that the Candidates nominated for Delegates in Convention and Members in Assembly, will be supported by all such in the county, who prefer the fixing a Government which will secure our Liberties and Happiness, to a servile reliance on the assurances of any men whatever, possessed of unlimitted powers, and of the PURSE as well as the SWORD.

Newspaper,No,J.M.,,Albany Journal,W.M.,3/15/1788,"Messrs. Printers, No man can behold the insiduous efforts of the Federal party, without disgust and indignation. They are straining every nerve and conjuring up imaginary phantoms, to delude the people. A few of our leading men in this city are very active in their endeavours to divide by dissentions, the people of this state—and, offer them a system of anarchy and confusion. These gentlemen, are in my opinion, like the witches in Macbeth, dancing round the chaldron of sedition, each throwing in his proportion of spells, for the confusion of his country.2 It behoves every man to look forward with anxiety, to the meeting of our Convention; and to put in men of tried integrity, who have shewn themselves staunch friends to the cause of liberty and virtue. I shall not trouble you with names, for that important trust, as your Journal has offered some men very well qualified to guard our freedom. The first wish of my heart is, that we may be happy and free; and the second is, that the Constitution may be rejected, unless it is previously amended."
Newspaper,No,Lover of Truth and Decency,,New York Journal,,3/18/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, In every party, there are generally some low and despicable characters, who are encouraged to defame and abuse the persons opposed to its views and designs. When this is the case, the batteries of scurrility are pointed at the most respectable men in the community; the most trivial and innocent actions are exaggerated into unpardonable faults, and falsehood is carried to such a length, as to degrade the dignity of human nature. So, at the present period, some of the advocates of the proposed constitution, exert all their powers to blast the good name, and wound the feelings of the most influential of their antagonists. Their productions abound more with invective than argument, and they seem determined to carry their point, in the face of an enlightened people, by a species of conduct as inconsistent with policy as it is with virtue. Amongst the variety of characters, at which they have aimed their envenomed shafts of malice, they have particularly selected the reputed author of the Rough-Hewer, as a fit object to glut their revenge, and satiate their fury.—For these several years, he has been persecuted with slander, and bespattered with the dirt of scurrility: his integrity has been questioned; his long and faithful services denied; his republican principles resolved into selfishness—and his understanding set on a level with folly. The late Lansingburgh newspaper is filled with rancorous pieces against him; and while the authors have not the spirit to give their names to the world, they have the consummate presumption, the satanic malevolence, to torture the efforts of the patriot into the designs of the knave; to advance as unquestionable facts, the most wicked falsehoods, and to over-leap, with [870]unexampled impudence, the boundaries of decency, propriety and truth. After trying every wicked art to ruin the reputation of the patriotic Rough-Hewer; after using every practicable method to undermine his popularity, they find their base attempts defeated, and their villainous suggestions treated with contempt. At last they betake themselves to a singular expedient to effectuate their wishes, which clearly shews the arbitrary ideas of the party, and evinces, that the power, not the will, is wanting in them, to trample upon the honest and free mechanics of this country, and to render them contemptible. A late writer steps forward, and with a view of aspersing the Rough-Hewer’s character, indirectly bestows on him the greatest praise, by asserting that he was formerly a Shoemaker. Will the citizens of Albany despise a man for having been a mechanic? Is not the man, who surmounts all the disadvantages attending the want of education by unremitted industry, and who, from a mechanical profession, rises to the highest honors in his country, entitled to respect and esteem, is not this the strongest evidence of the good morals and sound understanding of the Rough-Hewer? Is it reasonable to suppose, that a mechanic, with little education and with little property, could obtain the most dignified offices in America, without the possession of unblemished integrity, and a mind cultivated by assiduous application? Would the people place confidence in a man guilty of the faults, with which the Rough-Hewer is charged? If he at first imposed upon them. Is it possible that the imposition could last for so many years? I shall say little more on this head.—The comment on the designed aspersions, proves, that malice often defeats its own purposes, and that the merit of the man must be great indeed, when his most inveterate enemies bear testimony to his virtues. If we contrast the means, by which the Rough-Hewer acquired a moderate competency and the public esteem, with the conduct of his traducers, he will not suffer by the comparison, in the opinion of those who are well acquainted with the histories of their lives. He never obtained his property by pimping, or by the disgrace of his dearest connections—nor by the prostitution of his feelings, did he ever attain to grandeur; nor by the prostitution of the liberties of his country, does he attempt still more to agrandize himself. From his infancy, he has walked in the road of probity; this has firmly settled him in the esteem of his independent fellow-citizens, and given him a degree of influence, which enables him to defeat the views of an unprincipled faction, although supported by the weight of ill-gotten wealth. Men, destitute of character, take a malevolent pleasure in destroying the reputation of others.—The vicious are at enmity with the good. [871]The advocates of tyranny hate the staunch friends of liberty. No wonder then that so many vile and traductious publications appear against the Rough Hewer. While the noble stand, which he has always made against an over-bearing lordly party, endears him to all lovers of the rights of mankind, it has raised up against him an host of enemies, composed of aristocratical and wicked men, who have had the address to convert presses, which ought to be decent and free, into vehicles of private resentment and scandal; and who, under the garb of public spirit, promote measures, which, if adopted, will inevitably enslave their country. If those patrons of scurrility would pause a moment and examine their own conduct, they would find, that the most severe and just retaliation might be carried into effect, and that a simple relation of facts would render them the laughing stocks of all companies, and draw down on their heads the detestation of America."
Newspaper,No,Cassius,,Poughkeepsie County Journal,Many Antifederalists,3/18/1788,"To the Opposers of the New Constitution in Dutchess County. Permit a fellow citizen, who has your welfare most sincerely at heart, to address you on a subject of the utmost moment to your freedom and happiness—a fellow citizen, who has considered with the deepest [1447]regret, the daring attempts to involve you in slavery and ruin, and who looks up to your patriotism and discernment, as the only resources, to avert the impending dangers of despotism. That the advocates of the new Constitution, have put in practice every art to accomplish their end—that they stop at nothing to promote a measure which you justly conceive, will reduce you to vassallage and misery, must be obvious to you all. You will then have no reason to wonder, when I impute the piece in Mr. Power’s paper of the fourth instant, under the signature of many Antifederalists,2 to one of them—when I consider it as purposely designed, to divide your votes at the election of delegates for the ensuing State Convention, and consequently to place it in their power to obtain a majority of voices for the friends of the new system. They are sensible that you greatly exceed them in number and respectability.—They well know, that unanimity in you, will defeat and ruin their projects in this county, and, that the only method for them to bring about their purposes, is, to raise up jealousies among you, and to set you at variance. For this end (I believe) an unprincipled man of the party, wrote the performance, signed many Antifederalists. The greatest part of you have unquestionably seen through the thinly veiled design of the author, have penetrated into his base deceit. It may not however, be improper to make some remarks on his production. I lay it down as an uncontrovertible position, that the only requisite qualifications in your Delegates to the State Convention, are firmness, character, ability, and an entire concurrence in sentiment with yourselves, on the subject of the new Constitution, and that the only thing essential for them to be acquainted with, as to your situation and feelings, is your opinion of the proposed government. Try the gentlemen in the first nomination3 by this standard, and if I am not greatly deceived, you will find them unexceptionable. The observations of the writer of the many Antifederalists, as they respect your representation in the Convention, must necessarily appear more like the ravings of a Bedlamite4 than the deductions of sober reason; however applicable they may be to your members of the Legislature. This writer, instead of convincing your reason, appeals to your passions, and endeavours to alarm your pride, by torturing into an insult, the nomination of Mr. Smith. With an air of exultation, he enquires “What is the plain English in the nomination of Mr. Smith, of New-York? It is this, that seven men cannot be found in this large county, who are fit to be entrusted on the momentous question.” I answer, that this is supposing an absurdity, that no man acquainted with human nature, would advance such an assertion—for is it not, in other words, saying that the gentlemen who held up Mr. Smith, had an indifferent opinion not only of their friends, their acquaintances and [1448]connexions, but of themselves? The most candid construction of his nomination, is this—Mr. Smith has considerable property in Dutchess county, he has resided for a long time in it, and always acted the part of a patriot, republican, and worthy citizen; he has filled with ecclat and credit, the offices of Sheriff and Judge:—Since his removal to New-York, the Legislature have repeatedly chosen him in Congress—a station which has given him an opportunity of prying into the designs, and seeing through the schemes of the advocates of despotism. He is a man of unquestionable integrity, and great abilities and information; notwithstanding the high honors he enjoyed, he has always persevered in his attachment to liberty—and consequently he is a strenuous, a formidable enemy to the infamous scheme of tyranny. In testimony of the high opinion a number of the respectable inhabitants of Dutchess, entertain of his virtues and abilities, they unanimously agree to nominate him as a Delegate to the ensuing State Convention—where it will be solemnly and finally determined, whether the yeomanry of this State shall be freemen or slaves. I appeal to you, my fellow citizens, if this looks like an insult—if it has the smallest appearance of a design to wound your feelings—to disparage your understanding—to question your probity. You may rest satisfied, that the author of the insidious performance deviates from the truth, when he asserts that Mr. Smith has changed his opinion, and is now favorable to the adoption of the proposed constitution: If this was the case, the writer above referred to would, I dare affirm, have no objections to his election; but the contrary is universally known, and I am convinced that there is no man in the State more firm in his opposition to the new constitution than Mr. Smith; no man that more fully harmonizes in sentiment with you concerning it; and no man that would serve you with greater fidelity in the convention. I would wish to be properly understood. I entertain the greatest respect for the gentlemen in the second nomination;5 and, if they were not respectable, their being nominated would not have answered the wishes of the writer of Many Antifederalists. I doubt not but that many other characters, high in your esteem, will be recommended as worthy your suffrages; and unless you shut your ears against the syren voice of insinuation and deceit—unless you stifle the incitements of ambition and the stirrings of pride—unless you guard against the influence of dissimulation and the machinations of your enemies, the death-warrant of your liberties will be signed, and you will be converted into hewers of wood and drawers of water.6 I cannot conceive what the advocates of the new government propose to themselves, by the practice of such mean and unmanly arts, as they are frequently guilty of. Can they suppose that a government, established by fraud and sanctioned by imposition, can be satisfactory or lasting? Will the objects of their deceit tamely submit [1449]to such unworthy treatment and suffer themselves to be led like lambs to the slaughter? I shall say no more—I rely on your good sense and patriotism, and beg leave to recommend to your serious attention, the following remarks of a celebrated writer, as well adapted to the situation of the friends of equal liberty in this State—“Our vigilance and our union, are success and safety. Our negligence and our division, are distress and death. They are worse. They are shame and slavery. Let us equally shun the benumbing stillness of over-weening sloth and the feverish activity of that ill-formed zeal which busies itself in maintaining little, mean and narrow opinions.”7 March 14, 1788."

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,3/20/1788,"(Continued.) I said in my last number,2 that the supreme court under this constitution would be exalted above all other power in the government, and subject to no controul. The business of this paper will be to illustrate this, and to shew the danger that will result from it. I question whether the world ever saw, in any period of it, a court of justice invested with such immense powers, and yet placed in a situation so little responsible. Certain it is, that in England, and in the several states, where we have been taught to believe, the courts of law are put upon the most prudent establishment, they are on a very different footing. The judges in England, it is true, hold their offices during their good behaviour, but then their determinations are subject to correction by the house of lords; and their power is by no means so extensive as that of the proposed supreme court of the union.—I believe they in no instance assume the authority to set aside an act of parliament under the idea that it is inconsistent with their constitution. They consider themselves bound to decide according to the existing laws of the land, and never undertake to controul them by adjudging that they are inconsistent with the constitution—much less are they vested with the power of giv[ing] an equitable construction to the constitution. The judges in England are under the controul of the legislature, for they are bound to determine according to the laws passed by them. But the judges under this constitution will controul the legislature, for the supreme court are authorised in the last resort, to determine what is the extent of the powers of the Congress; they are to give the constitution an explanation, and there is no power above them to sit aside their judgment. The framers of this constitution appear to have followed that of the British, in rendering the judges independent, by granting them their offices during good behaviour, without following the constitution of England, in instituting a tribunal in which their errors may be corrected; and without adverting to this, that the judicial under this system have a power which is above the legislative, and which indeed transcends any power before given to a judicial by any free government under heaven. I do not object to the judges holding their commissions during good behaviour. I suppose it a proper provision provided they were made properly responsible. But I say, this system has followed the English government in this, while it has departed from almost every other principle of their jurisprudence, under the idea, of rendering the judges independent; which, in the British constitution, means no more than that they hold their places during good behaviour, and have fixed salaries, they have made the judges independent, in the fullest sense of the word. There is no power above them, to controul any of their decisions. There is no authority that can remove them, and they cannot be controuled by the laws of the legislature. In short, they are independent of the people, of the legislature, and of every power under heaven. Men placed in this situation will generally soon feel themselves independent of heaven itself. Before I proceed to illustrate the truth of these assertions, I beg liberty to make one remark—Though in my opinion the judges ought to hold their offices during good behaviour, yet I think it is clear, that the reasons in favour of this establishment of the judges in England, do by no means apply to this country. [873 The great reason assigned, why the judges in Britain ought to be commissioned during good behaviour, is this, that they may be placed in a situation, not to be influenced by the crown, to give such decisions, as would tend to increase its powers and prerogatives. While the judges held their places at the will and pleasure of the king, on whom they depended not only for their offices, but also for their salaries, they were subject to every undue influence. If the crown wished to carry a favorite point, to accomplish which the aid of the courts of law was necessary, the pleasure of the king would be signified to the judges. And it required the spirit of a martyr, for the judges to determine contrary to the king’s will.—They were absolutely dependent upon him both for their offices and livings. The king, holding his office during life, and transmitting it to his posterity as an inheritance, has much stronger inducements to increase the prerogatives of his office than those who hold their offices for stated periods, or even for life. Hence the English nation gained a great point, in favour of liberty. When they obtained the appointment of the judges, during good behaviour, they got from the crown a concession, which deprived it of one of the most powerful engines with which it might enlarge the boundaries of the royal prerogative and encroach on the liberties of the people. But these reasons do not apply to this country, we have no hereditary monarch; those who appoint the judges do not hold their offices for life, nor do they descend to their children. The same arguments, therefore, which will conclude in favor of the tenor of the judge’s offices for good behaviour, lose a considerable part of their weight when applied to the state and condition of America. But much less can it be shewn, that the nature of our government requires that the courts should be placed beyond all account more independent, so much so as to be above controul. I have said that the judges under this system will be independent in the strict sense of the word: To prove this I will shew—That there is no power above them that can controul their decisions, or correct their errors. There is no authority that can remove them from office for any errors or want of capacity, or lower their salaries, and in many cases their power is superior to that of the legislature. 1st. There is no power above them that can correct their errors or controul their decisions—The adjudications of this court are final and irreversible, for there is no court above them to which appeals can lie, either in error or on the merits.—In this respect it differs from the courts in England, for there the house of lords is the highest court, to whom appeals, in error, are carried from the highest of the courts of law. 2d. They cannot be removed from office or suffer a dimunition of their salaries, for any error in judgement or want of capacity. It is expressly declared by the constitution,—“That they shall at stated times receive a compensation for their services which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.” The only clause in the constitution which provides for the removal of the judges from offices, is that which declares, that “the president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office, on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” By this paragraph, civil officers, in which the judges are included, are removable only for crimes. Treason and bribery are named, and the rest are included under the general terms of high crimes and misdemeanors.—Errors in judgement, or want of capacity to discharge the duties of the office, can never be supposed to be included in these words, high crimes and misdemeanors. A man may mistake a case in giving judgment, or manifest that he is incompetent to the discharge of the duties of a judge, and yet give no evidence of corruption or want of integrity. To support the charge, it will be necessary to give in evidence some facts that will shew, that the judges commited the error from wicked and corrupt motives. 3d. The power of this court is in many cases superior to that of the legislature. I have shewed, in a former paper,3 that this court will be authorised to decide upon the meaning of the constitution, and that, not only according to the natural and ob[vious] meaning of the words, but also according to the spirit and intention of it. In the exercise of this power they will not be subordinate to, but above the legislature. For all the departments of this government will receive their powers, so far as they are expressed in the constitution, from the people immediately, who are the source of power. The legislature can only exercise such powers as are given them by the constitution, they cannot assume any of the rights annexed to the judicial, for this plain reason, that the same authority which vested the legislature with their powers, vested the judicial with theirs—both are derived from the same source, both therefore are equally valid, and the judicial hold their powers independently of the legislature, as the legislature do of the judicial.—The supreme court then have a right, independent of the legislature, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature. In England the judges are not only subject to have their [875]decisions set aside by the house of lords, for error, but in cases where they give an explanation to the laws or constitution of the country, contrary to the sense of the parliament, though the parliament will not set aside the judgement of the court, yet, they have authority, by a new law, to explain a former one, and by this means to prevent a reception of such decisions. But no such power is in the legislature. The judges are supreme—and no law, explanatory of the constitution, will be binding on them. From the preceding remarks, which have been made on the judicial powers proposed in this system, the policy of it may be fully developed. I have, in the course of my observation on this constitution, affirmed and endeavored to shew, that it was calculated to abolish entirely the state governments, and to melt down the states into one entire government, for every purpose as well internal and local, as external and national. In this opinion the opposers of the system have generally agreed—and this has been uniformly denied by its advocates in public. Some individuals, indeed, among them, will confess, that it has this tendency, and scruple not to say, it is what they wish; and I will venture to predict, without the spirit of prophecy, that if it is adopted without amendments, or some such precautions as will ensure amendments immediately after its adoption, that the same gentlemen who have employed their talents and abilities with such success to influence the public mind to adopt this plan, will employ the same to persuade the people, that it will be for their good to abolish the state governments as useless and burdensome. Perhaps nothing could have been better conceived to facilitate the abolition of the state governments than the constitution of the judicial. They will be able to extend the limits of the general government gradually, and by insensible degrees, and to accomodate themselves to the temper of the people. Their decisions on the meaning of the constitution will commonly take place in cases which arise between individuals, with which the public will not be generally acquainted; one adjudication will form a precedent to the next, and this to a following one. These cases will immediately affect individuals only; so that a series of determinations will probably take place before even the people will be informed of them. In the mean time all the art and address of those who wish for the change will be employed to make converts to their opinion. The people will be told, that their state officers, and state legislatures are a burden and expence without affording any solid advantage, for that all the laws passed by them, might be equally well made by the general legislature. If to those who will be interested in the change, be added, those who will be under their influence, and [876]such who will submit to almost any change of government, which they can be persuaded to believe will ease them of taxes, it is easy to see, the party who will favor the abolition of the state governments would be far from being inconsiderable.—In this situation, the general legislature, might pass one law after another, extending the general and abridging the state jurisdictions, and to sanction their proceedings would have a course of decisions of the judicial to whom the constitution has committed the power of explaining the constitution.—If the states remonstrated, the constitutional mode of deciding upon the validity of the law, is with the supreme court, and neither people, nor state legislatures, nor the general legislature can remove them or reverse their decrees. Had the construction of the constitution been left with the legislature, they would have explained it at their peril; if they exceed their powers, or sought to find, in the spirit of the constitution, more than was expressed in the letter, the people from whom they derived their power could remove them, and do themselves right; and indeed I can see no other remedy that the people can have against their rulers for encroachments of this nature. A constitution is a compact of a people with their rulers; if the rulers break the compact, the people have a right and ought to remove them and do themselves justice; but in order to enable them to do this with the greater facility, those whom the people chuse at stated periods, should have the power in the last resort to determine the sense of the compact; if they determine contrary to the understanding of the people, an appeal will lie to the people at the period when the rulers are to be elected, and they will have it in their power to remedy the evil; but when this power is lodged in the hands of men independent of the people, and of their representatives, and who are not, constitutionally, accountable for their opinions, no way is left to controul them but with a high hand and an outstretched arm."

Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,4/3/1788,"From a Correspondent. It is universally agreed, that the object of every just government is to render the people happy, by securing their persons and possessions from wrong. To this end it is necessary that there should be local laws and institutions; for a people inhabiting various climates will unavoidably have local habits and different modes of life, and these must be consulted in making the laws. It is much easier to adapt the laws to the manners of the people, than to make manners conform to laws.—No state can be happy, when the laws contradict the general habits of the people, nor can any state retain its freedom, while there is a power to make and enforce such laws. We may go further, and say, that it is impossible for any single legislature so fully to comprehend the circumstances of the different parts of a very extensive dominion, as to make laws adapted to those circumstances.—Hence arises in most nations of extensive territory, the necessity of armies, to cure the defect of the laws. It is actually under the pressure of such an absurd government, that the Spanish provinces have groaned for near three centuries; and such will be our misfortune and degradation, if we ever submit to have all the business of the empire done by one legislature. The contrary principle of local legislation by the representatives of the people, who alone are to be governed by the laws, has raised us to our present greatness; and an attempt on the part of Great-Britain, to invade this right, brought on the revolution, which gave us a separate rank among the nations. We even declared that we would not be represented in the national legislature, because one assembly was not adequate to the purposes of internal legislation and taxation."

Snyder was decidedly against the New Constitution, and in order to Reconcile, and avoid any Reflections that might be made of parties, and to Satisfy and Unite the good people of Kingston, it was deemed most expedient to Appoint Coll. Snyder a member of the Committee, which [was done?] with the fullest confidence in his fidelity—If however [we?] should have been deceived in the Man, I suppose it will be proper, and doubt not but that we have it [in] our Power, to prevent any Confidential Communications being Sent to him—and Assure you that if we had been informed of the Nomination at the Meeting at Degroves at Newburgh and Coll. Snyders determination to support their list, he would not have been Appointed a Member. And I will if you suppose there is reason to mistrust him, take measures to Stop all correspondence with him After you was at Poughkeepsie I mentioned to the Governor that many of the principal people of Kingston were much against the Nomination of Mr. Addison by the Committee for a Delegate to the State Convention, and that he (the Governor) would be Elected in the Room of Mr. Addison—Whereupon the Governor gave me for Answer that, the Electing of him in the Room of Addison, would be departing from the Agreement made by the Committee, that he had understood that they had fixed in case he was to be Elected in Ulster his Brother James was to be left out, and if his Brother and he should be both Elected in Ulster and Addison left out, it might be supposed to have the appearance of partyship in them against him which he would Wish to avoid. Expressing his Wishes while fixed so, that the People would be satisfied with their list—not Doubting but that Addison, would prove true—this I would have communicated to you from Poughkeepsie, but as a Meeting of some of the Members from each County was proposed, I deferred it Untill the Result of the Meeting was known, of which I have since my return home informed Judge [Wynkoop?] & requested him to Consult our friends on the Subject—which is the Reason that I had not wrote to You Since. At this Meeting it was by Some of the Members present Suggested to the Members of our County, that it would be best for Ulster not to fix on the Governor for a Delegate until they were informed, that it could not be fixed with certainty that the Governor should be Elected a Delegate for Kings County, Where, if the Governor is not Elected it is highly probable the whole Representation will be fedral—Which County however, placeing the highest confidence in the Governor is supposed will not hesitate, if proposed to them, to make him their choice for a Delegate, and with him Elect another Member whose Opposition to the new Constitution can by Relyed on—This proposition Melancton Smith Esquire, who was present at the Meeting, and going to New York immediately thereafter, engaged, with [Cornelius] Wykoff, to Communicate to some of the principal Characters in that County as soon as he came Home, and when fixed with certainty there, he has promised immediately thereupon to inform us thereof—This proposition was consented to on our part, because, if the Governor was Elected in Kings County, there was no doubt at all but that our County would notwithstanding Elect six Members who would be decidedly against the New Constitution, and in that case there would be two Members Gained to our Cause which you doubtless will admit to be a good [Result?] I Perfectly agree with you in Opinion that we ought to support the first list fixed at Poughkeepsie if there should be any danger of division taking place amongst us, or that by the Change we would have Reason to suspect that a Man would be Elected that was not decidedly against the New Constitution—But my dear friend let not our Zeal lead us [against a Man?] Ready and willing to support [the first list Agreed?] on by us, But if the Governor should be fixed to be Elected [in?] Kings County with certainty and you could think it safe and adviseable I would have no Objections to fix on any other Gentleman in Kingston you would approve of in the Room of Addison and give up the Governor, this I would consent to, only to Strengthen the General Cause, thereby to gain in Numbers in the Convention,—And if you do not think it advised let me know it and I shall do every thing in my power to Support the list—(I am afraid I shall wear out your patience to Read this.) I believe the Fedral Cause has in this County so few Supporters and most of them very Weak ones too, that there would be no danger in the Cause if we was even now to fix upon an entire new list, to carry it into Effect if we will only exert ourselves, why then should we be afraid for the change of one name only, however important to the List—and especially as I observed before while we would with our Exertions gain one or two to the Number in support of the Cause—If we had not a sufficiency of good Men on which I am sure you’ll agree with me we may Depend and who have as much Influence in our County as any of the Men on the fedral List in whom they place the highest confidence—You’ll pardon me for tresspassing on your patience so much with this long letter, when I Assure you that it is my Wish to give you all the information in my Power, (which from its nature has led Me to this length) trusting that it may serve to conciliate and promote our Cause—Must however yet Add, that I shall not write to New York to Stop the Election of the Governor in Kings, think it best that if He should be Elected there, And we deem it most Expedient to Elect him here, it will [– – –] promote the cause if he should be Elected even in both the Counties—With Respect to Senators and Assemblymen to Represent this County to be Chosen in the ensuing Election, it is Rather delicate to me, because it is probable I should be held up—if so, it is not my Wish,—and it would be hard that I should therefore not be at liberty to Nominate—My Sentiments I will give you freely, it is my Opinion that Genl. James Clinton Would be proper to Recommend for a Senator—if not approved of Judge Wynkoop I also think would be proper—I have Spent the Afternoon Yesterday with Sherrif [Egbert] DuMond and we have had a long conversation upon this Subject he will present you a list of Names for Candidates—it was my determination to Nominate you for one with Mr. [Christopher] Tappen in Kingston, but the Sherrif says that you positively declare that you will not Serve, and therefore have thought of Major Phillip Dubois Bevier.

Newspaper,No,A Duchess County Anti-Federalist,,Poughkeepsie County Journal,,4/8/1788,"To the Antifederalists of Ulster County. Among the many privileges secured to us by the Constitution of this State, that of personally voting our representatives in Legislature, is one of the most essential. Your inattention to the exercise of this right, for several elections past, fills me with serious apprehensions of the same supineness of conduct in the ensuing. ‘Tis not uncommon to hear many people censure the conduct of the Legislature for acts which they have passed, complain of the weight of taxes and the inequality of county quotas, while these very people have not stirred to give a single vote for a representative, though within one mile, perhaps one hundred yards of the place of election. To such a man, the non-exercise of the right of election is the same as its non-existence. Ought the man who voluntarily suspends his right of electing his representatives to find fault with a body of men in whose appointment he neglected to have any agency? He who does not vote ought not to complain. This year every freeman above the age of twenty-one, is called upon to vote delegates to form a state-convention for the adoption of a Federal Constitution.2 ‘Tis by the fiat of the people alone, that this constitution can start into existence. They must breathe into it the breath of life. In the common acts of legislation your representatives act for you, but every act must be within the limits and warranted by the constitution of the State; the adoption or rather the creation of the federal constitution, will be the immediate act of the people themselves. This constitution has circulated for some time among you; read it with an eye of criticism, examine the powers which are given and the rights which are reserved (if there are any.) Remember,(a) that though all governments have the same general end, which is that of preservation, yet each has another particular view—Increase of dominion was the view of Rome; war of Sparta; and religion, of the Jewish laws; commerce that of Marseilles; natural liberty is the view of the policy of Savages; and in monarchies, the Prince and the kingdom’s glory. Political liberty ought to be the direct end of the federal constitution. Analize this system to discover this liberty—neither great talents nor great labour are requisite to the task. If you find this liberty, speak the word and it shall be. If on the contrary it is neither to be found in your immediate suffrages for, nor in the equality of representation; if the powers vested in the legislative, executive and judiciary departments, are in some instances repugnant to and inconsistent with that spirit of equal liberty which ought as much as possible, pervade every branch of a confederate government, then reject it. Whatever opinions you may have formed respecting the federal constitution, be careful that your delegates are gentlemen of the same opinion with yourselves. Avoid men of fluctuating sentiments in politics. The weathercock of party-spirit, ambition and self-interest, ought not in such a situation as this, to be trusted. The Committee which met at the New-Paltz on the 28th ultimo,3 was formed of representatives from ten precincts of the county: This committee nominated six gentlemen, and agreed to hold them up for the choice of the people in their respective precincts, as delegates to represent the county in the State Convention, in June next. Adhere to this list. Notwithstanding all the candidates may not be the immediate choice of every Antifederalist, which in no instance is ever to be expected. Yet all little party spirit and mean jealoucies must in the present instance, be laid aside. These are at all times below the notice of a man of reason and understanding. He that would sacrifice the union of his party, or endanger the success of a good cause for the gratification of his personal resentment, is unworthy not only of the confidence, but even of the attention of the public.—From recent information, the Antifederalists4 are playing the same sport in your county they are doing in this. They are attempting to divide you. A number of gentlemen lately met at New-Windsor,5 and are handing through the county a list different from that of the county committee: I am personally acquainted with several of those gentlemen, and respect them; some of them are men of property and interest, the reputation of Col. J——n,6 who signed their proceedings, as a man of an enlarged understanding and fixed ideas of government may have an influence—But how will you reconcile the conduct of this meeting, with their principles? The gentlemen who met at New-Windsor, are many of them avowed Federalists. The list of candidates they hold up are all (or at least now supposed to be) Anti-federalists. If they are tenacious of their principles, can we expect they will give a single vote to a candidate, whom they believe to be determined against the system they wish to adopt.—No! their aim is to divide, and by industriously feeding the little discontents, and fomenting the divisions among the Anti-federalists; they mean to lessen the number of votes necessary to carry the Election—and by uniting, bring in characters of the same sentiments in politics with themselves. Rouse then my fellow freemen from your wonted inactivity at elections, manage the ensuing not with the spirit of faction, but with a spirit of union and discernment, to what you may conceive is the public good!—If on the adoption or rejection of the federal Constitution, you believe your happiness or misery as a people depends, let your exertions be in proportion to the magnitude of the object to be obtained, or the evil to be avoided. ‘Tis not my intention at present to enter on the merits of the federal Constitution, to point out the defects on the one hand, or take notice of the excess of power granted to the other; many of these may easily be discovered by a man of common discernment, provided he reads with attention and reflects on what he reads. It is true that the public papers have teemed with learned and elaborate essays in favor of this Constitution—the beauties of language, and the charms of eloquence have been lavished in its praises; yet on a strict examination, it will be found, that most of the arguments in its favor, are rather palliations, than any rational justification on the solid principles of the political liberty of a confederated republic. My principal design in addressing the anti-federalists of Ulster county on the present occasion, is to recommend to them a spirit of union among themselves, to discountenance all factions and party spirits, and to make them guard against the machinations of the federal meeting held at New-Windsor; for this I shall not be blamed by the federalists themselves.—Actuated with the same zeal, and having the same end in view, the general good of the union; only differing in the means, there is a noble and active emulation, between the federalists and anti-federalists—The evident aim of the former is to divide the latter among themselves, the evident interest of the latter is to remain united.

Newspaper,No,Brutus,,New York Journal,,4/10/1788,"When great and extraordinary powers are vested in any man, or body of men, which in their exercise, may operate to the oppression of the people, it is of high importance that powerful checks should be formed to prevent the abuse of it. Perhaps no restraints are more forcible, than such as arise from responsibility to some superior power.—Hence it is that the true policy of a republican government is, to frame it in such manner, that all persons who are concerned in the government, are made accountable to some superior for their conduct in office.—This responsibility should ultimately rest with the People. To have a government well administered in all its parts, it is requisite the different departments of it should be separated and lodged as much as may be in different hands. [908]The legislative power should be in one body, the executive in another, and the judicial in one different from either—But still each of these bodies should be accountable for their conduct. Hence it is impracticable, perhaps, to maintain a perfect distinction between these several departments—For it is difficult, if not impossible, to call to account the several officers in government, without in some degree mixing the legislative and judicial. The legislature in a free republic2 are chosen by the people at stated periods, and their responsibility consists, in their being amenable to the people. When the term, for which they are chosen, shall expire, who will then have opportunity to displace them if they disapprove of their conduct—but it would be improper that the judicial should be elective, because their business requires that they should possess a degree of law knowledge, which is acquired only by a regular education, and besides it is fit that they should be placed, in a certain degree in an independent situation, that they may maintain firmness and steadiness in their decisions. As the people therefore ought not to elect the judges, they cannot be amenable to them immediately, some other mode of amenability must therefore be devised for these, as well as for all other officers which do not spring from the immediate choice of the people: this is to be effected by making one court subordinate to another, and by giving them cognizance of the behaviour of all officers; but on this plan we at last arrive at some supreme, over whom there is no power to controul but the people themselves. This supreme controling power should be in the choice of the people, or else you establish an authority independent, and not amenable at all, which is repugnant to the principles of a free government. Agreeable to these principles I suppose the supreme judicial ought to be liable to be called to account, for any misconduct, by some body of men, who depend upon the people for their places; and so also should all other great officers in the State, who are not made amenable to some superior offic[er?]. This policy seems in some measure to have been in view of the framers of the new system, and to have given rise to the institution of a court of impeachments—How far this Court will be properly qualified to execute the trust which will be reposed in them, will be the business of a future paper to investigate. To prepare the way to do this, it shall be the business of this, to make some remarks upon the constitution and powers of the Senate, with whom the power of trying impeachments is lodged. The following things may be observed with respect to the constitution of the Senate. 1st. They are to be elected by the legislatures of the States and not by the people, and each State is to be represented by an equal number. 2d. They are to serve for six years, except that one third of those first chosen are to go out of office at the expiration of two years, one third at the expiration of four years, and one third at the expiration of six years, after which this rotation is to be preserved, but still every member will serve for the term of six years. 3d. If vacancies happen by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any State, the executive3 is authorised to make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature. 4. No person can be a senator who has not arrived to the age of thirty years, been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who is not at the time he is elected an inhabitant of the State for which he is elected. The apportionment of members of [the] Senate among the States is not according to numbers, or the importance of the States; but is equal. This, on the plan of a consolidated government, is unequal and improper; but is proper on the system of confederation—on this principle I approve of it. It is indeed the only feature of any importance in the constitution of a confederated government. It was obtained after a vigorous struggle of that part of the Convention who were in favor of preserving the state governments. It is to be regret[t]ed, that they were not able to have infused other principles into the plan, to have secured the government of the respective states, and to have marked with sufficient precision the line between them and the general government. The term for which the senate are to be chosen, is in my judgment too long, and no provision being made for a rotation will, I conceive, be of dangerous consequence. It is difficult to fix the precise period for which the senate should be chosen. It is a matter of opinion, and our sentiments on the matter must be formed, by attending to certain principles. Some of the duties which are to be performed by the senate, seem evidently to point out the propriety of their term of service being extended beyond the period of that of the assembly. Besides as they are designed to represent the aristocracy of the country, it seems fit they should possess more stability, and so continue a longer period than that branch who represent the democracy. The business of making treaties and some other which it will be proper to commit to the senate, requires that they should have experience, and therefore that they should remain some time in office to acquire it.—But still it is of equal importance that they should not be so long in office as to be likely to forget the hand that formed them, or be insensible of their interests. Men long in office are very apt to feel themselves independent. To form and pursue interests separate from those who appointed them. And this is more likely to be [910]the case with the senate, as they will for the most part of the time be absent from the state they represent, and associate with such company as will possess very little of the feelings of the middling class of people. For it is to be remembered that there is to be a federal city, and the inhabitants of it will be the great and the mighty of the earth. For these reasons I would shorten the term of their service to four years. Six years is a long period for a man to be absent from his home, it would have a tendency to wean him from his constituents. A rotation in the senate, would also in my opinion be of great use. It is probable that senators once chosen for a state will, as the system now stands, continue in office for life. The office will be honorable if not lucrative. The persons who occupy it will probably wish to continue in it, and therefore use all their influence and that of their friends to continue in office.—Their friends will be numerous and powerful, for they will have it in their power to confer great favors; besides it will before long be considered as disgraceful not to be re-elected. It will therefore be considered as a matter of delicacy to the character of the senator not to return him again.—Every body acquainted with public affairs knows how difficult it is to remove from office a person who is long been in it. It is seldom done except in cases of gross misconduct. It is rare that want of competent ability procures it. To prevent this inconvenience I conceive it would be wise to determine, that a senator should not be eligible after he had served for the period assigned by the constitution for a certain number of years; perhaps three would be sufficient. A farther benefit would be derived from such an arrangement; it would give opportunity to bring forward a greater number of men to serve their country, and would return those, who had served, to their state, and afford them the advantage of becoming better acquainted with the condition and politics of their constituents. It farther appears to me proper, that the legislatures should retain the right which they now hold under the confederation, of recalling their members.4 It seems an evident dictate of reason, that when a person authorises another to do a piece of business for him, he should retain the power to displace him, when he does not conduct according to his pleasure. This power in the state legislatures, under confederation, has not been exercised to the injury of the government, nor do I see any danger of its being so exercised under the new system. It may operate much to the public benefit. These brief remarks are all I shall make on the organization of the senate. The powers with which they are invested will require a more minute investigation. [911] This body will possess a strange mixture of legislative, executive and judicial powers, which in my opinion will in some cases clash with each other. 1. They are one branch of the legislature, and in this respect will possess equal powers in all cases with the house of representatives; for I consider the clause which gives the house of representatives the right of originating bills for raising a revenue as merely nominal, seeing the senate are authorised to propose or concur with amendments. 2. They are a branch of the executive in the appointment of ambassadors and public ministers, and in the appointment of all other officers, not otherwise provided for; whether the forming of treaties, in which they are joined with the president, appertains to the legislative or the executive part of the government, or to neither, is not material. 3. They are part of the judicial, for they form the court of impeachments. It has been a long established maxim, that the legislative, executive and judicial departments in government should be kept distinct. It is said. I know, that this cannot be done. And therefore that this maxim is not just, or at least that it should only extend to certain leading features in a government. I admit that this distinction cannot be perfectly preserved. In a due ballanced government, it is perhaps absolutely necessary to give the executive qualified legislative powers, and the legislative or a branch of them judicial powers in the last resort. It may possibly also, in some special cases, be adviseable to associate the legislature, or a branch of it, with the executive, in the exercise of acts of great national importance. But still the maxim is a good one, and a separation of these powers should be sought as far as is practicable. I can scarcely imagine that any of the advocates of the system will pretend, that it was necessary to accumulate all these powers in the senate. There is a propriety in the senate’s possessing legislative powers; this is the principal end which should be held in view in their appointment. I need not here repeat what has so often and ably been advanced on the subject of a division of the legislative power into two branches—The arguments in favor of it I think conclusive. But I think it equally evident, that a branch of the legislature should not be invested with the power of appointing officers. This power in the senate is very improperly lodged for a number of reasons—These shall be detailed in a future number."
Newspaper,No,Watchman,,New York Journal,,4/10/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, When a man, who possesses a mind incapable of aspiring to higher objects of contemplation than the inspection of butter and hogslard, and the culling of staves—who never intentionally performed a patriotic action, and who never felt the force of any other principle than interest—openly declares, that the opponents of the new constitution are either knaves, fools, or interested men—resentment must be excited, by the impudence of the expression, and contempt, by the self-importance of the expressor. A person of the least liberality would never harbour such contracted, such prejudiced sentiments: a person of common sense would never utter them; and a man of the most superficial discernment would never attempt to brand with knavery or folly, the most honest and respectable characters of America—but when we reflect, what better can be expected from one, who possesses all the faults, and none of the good qualities, incident to the mercantile profession? Would it not be as ridiculous to expect, that the purchasing of provisions, the distributing of Whiskey, and the starving of a patriotic army for the sake of pelf, would polish the manners, expand the mind, or meliorate the morals, as it would be to suppose, that comfort could be drawn from presumption, and imprudence, or sand, converted into gold."

When the day appointed came, their influence extended so far as to collect seven freeholders who were all good whigs (or in other words those distinguished by the appellation of Antes) who assured the three rich and well-born gentlemen they had but one observation to make which was the following, “We think you are come out on a very foolish erand.”"

Henry Oothoudt, Peter Vrooman, Dirck Swart, Israel Thompson, Anthony Ten Eyck.2 As we have been informed, that the advocates for the New Constitution, have lately travelled through the several districts in the county, and propagated an opinion, that it is a good system of government; we beg leave to state, in as few words as possible, some of the many objections against it— The Convention, who were appointed for the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the Confederation, have taken upon themselves the power of making a new one. They have not formed a federal but a consolidated government, repugnant to the principles of a republican government; not founded on the preservation but the destruction of the state governments. The great and extensive powers granted to the New Government over the lives, liberties and property of every citizen. These powers in many instances not defined or sufficiently explained, and capable of being interpreted to answer the most ambitious and arbitrary purposes. The small number of members who are to compose the General Legislature, which is to pass laws to govern so large and extensive a Continent, inhabited by people of different laws, customs and opinions, and many of them residing upwards of 400 miles from the seat of government. The members of the Senate are not to be chosen by the people, but appointed by the Legislature of each state for the term of six years. This will destroy their responsibility, and induce them to act like the masters and not the servants of the people. The power to alter and regulate the time, place and manner of holding elections, so as to keep them subjected to their influence. The power to lay poll taxes, duties, imposts, excises and other taxes. The power to appoint Continental officers to levy and collect those taxes. Their laws are to be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state are to be bound thereby, notwithstanding the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary. A sweeping clause, which subjects every thing to the controul of the New Government. Slaves are taken into the computation in apportioning the number of Representatives, whereby 50,000 slaves, give an equal representation with 30,000 freemen. [1381] The provision that the net produce of all duties and imposts, laid by the legislature of any state, on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States. The provision that none of the states shall coin money or emit bills of credit. The power to raise, support and maintain a standing army in time of peace. The bane of a republican government; by a standing army most of the once free nations of the globe have been reduced to bondage; and by this Britain attempted to inforce her arbitrary measures The power to call forth the militia to any part of the Continent, without any limitation of time or place, under the command of the President, or such Continental officers as shall be appointed over them. Men conscienciously scrupulous of bearing arms, made liable to perform military duty. The power of the New Government to establish the salaries for their own services. The power with respect to the payment of the salaries to Inferior Court Judges in the several states; and which salaries the New Constitution declares are not to be diminished. Their power relative to the migration or importation of foreigners. The not securing the rights of conscience in matters of religion, or granting the liberty of worshipping God agreeable to the mode thereby dictated; whereas the experience of all ages proves that the benevolence and humility inculcated in the gospel, are no restraint on the love of domination. The vast executive power vested in one man (not elected by the people;) who, though called President, will have powers equal if not superior to many European Kings. His legislative power of negativing all laws, resolutions and votes, thereby to prevent their passing unless agreed to by two thirds of both Houses of the Legislature. His long continuance in office, and even at the end of four years capable of being again chosen, and continued for life. The great powers granted to the grand Continental Supreme Court, extending to all cases in Law and Equity, and the allowing that Court original jurisdiction in certain cases. The granting of appeals to that Court on both Law and Fact. A powerful engine in the hands of the rich, to oppress and ruin the poor. The power to establish Inferior Courts in every state. No provision being made to prevent placemen and pensioners. Nor for the Liberty of the Press, that grand palladium of liberty and scourge of tyrants. The Trial by Jury, that sacred bulwark of liberty, is not provided for in Civil Cases. The power of appointing as many Continental officers as they shall think proper in every state, and thereby extending their influence over every part of the United States. The great additional expences of the New Government, and the burthensome and heavy taxes which will thereby be occasioned. Their guaranteeing to the several states, not the substance, but a Republican form of Government, and the states left at the mercy of the General Government, to allow them such a form as they shall deem proper. They have declared, that if the Conventions of nine states ratify the Constitution, it shall be established between the states so ratifying the same; by which means, if all the states should not adopt it, they have laid a foundation to defeat the Confederation and dissolve the Union of the States. A clause dictated by the same genius of Aristocracy, which prompted the Convention to enjoin secresy on their members, to keep their doors shut, their journals locked up, and none of the members to take any extracts. By the Articles of Confederation each state retains what is not expressly granted to Congress; but in the New Constitution, there is no provision or Bill of Rights, to secure any of the fundamental rights and liberties of the people. Notwithstanding so many and such powerful objections to this Constitution, some of its zealous advocates, have industriously attempted to persuade the people to adopt it. Is it for the sake of the poor and common people, that the rich and well born are so indefatigable? or is it because they and their friends and connections expect to possess some of the many lucrative offices under the New Government? They have asserted, that the present Confederation is defective and will tend to anarchy and confusion. That the expences of the New Government will be less. That the value of produce will be raised. That the concurrence of nine states will bind the whole. That the Constitution may hereafter be amended. As to the first, it is the weakest of all weak reasons, to adopt a bad Constitution because the present one is defective. A person of a sickly habit or constitution might as well put an end to his existence, for fear that his sickness or infirmity would be the cause of his death.—As to the second, a man must be very credulous and ignorant indeed, who can suppose that the New Government will not be more expensive—Will not the raising and supporting an army and navy, in time of peace, [1383]create additional expence? Can the multitude and variety of the salaries of the Continental Supreme Court Judges, the Continental Inferior Court Judges in the different states, and other civil officers in the judicial department, be paid without great additional expence? Can a federal town, for the seat of the National Government, be built without additional expence? Will not the furniture necessary for the Continental President, Vice-President, Secretaries, Treasurers, Comptrollers, Ministers &c. &c. &c. to grace their tables and adorn the rooms of their stately palaces, be costly and expensive? Can all these things, with many others, be accomplished without great additional expence, and without laying heavy and burthensome taxes on the people? As well might the Israelites of old, have made brick without straw.3 With respect to the Regulation of Trade, this may be vested in Congress under the present Confederation, without changing the fundamental principles of the general as well as all the State Governments—nor is it probable that, if the New Constitution should be adopted, the value of produce would be thereby increased—As well might it be said, that our soil will be better and our lands more fruitful. The assertion, that the adoption of the Constitution by nine states will bind every state, is not true. This falshood is contradicted by the express words of the last clause;4 and the threats given out that the dissenting states will be compelled to adopt it, is the language of tyrants, and an insult on the understandings of a free people. With regard to amendments, some of the strongest and most zealous advocates for the New Constitution, at first and for a long time, affected to hold it up as a good system of government—but after various and repeated journies into the country (having discovered that the people were generally opposed to the Constitution, and that they can and will judge on a matter of such consequence to themselves and their posterity) these same zealous advocates have since changed their ground, and altered their plan of operations: They now acknowledge it to be defective, but endeavor to prevail on the people, first to adopt it, and afterwards (like Massachusetts) trust to a recommendation for future amendments.5 Would it be prudent or safe for the people to surrender their dearest rights and liberties, to the discretionary disposal of their future rulers? First to make a surrender and afterwards ask for terms of capitulation. The freemen of America have fought and bled to oppose the oppression and usurpation of Great-Britain; and shall they now resign these rights and privileges, to a government which, if possible, may be still more arbitrary and despotic?—Sacred as well as profane history afford abundant examples to prove that the most strenuous assertors of liberty, in all ages after having successfully triumphed over tyranny, [1384]have themselves become tyrants, when intrusted by the people with unlimited and uncontroulable powers. No amendments can be obtained without the consent of three fourths of the states—Is it probable that such consent will ever be obtained, to amendments which will tend to abridge the powers of the New Government? Is it not rather more probable, that if any amendments are made, they will rather enlarge those powers? Will not those in power have influence sufficient at all times, to prevent more than one fourth of the states to consent to future amendments? From this source then, amendments are not to be expected, nor is it to be presumed that if the people once resign such great and extensive powers, they will ever be enabled to wrest them from a National Government, having the command of the purse as well as the sword. The 5th article of the Constitution points out a mode to obtain amendments, after it is adopted, which is to call a Convention for the purpose—and we conceive that a Convention may be called to amend the Constitution, before it is adopted with so many material and radical defects. These among many others, are the reasons that have induced us to oppose the New Constitution in its present form. A Constitution destructive of the fundamental principles of the general as well as all the State Governments—dangerous to the rights and liberties of the people, and which, if adopted without previous amendments will, in our opinion, terminate in slavery. If therefore you entertain the like sentiments, relative to this Constitution, we beg leave to request your vote and interest in favor of the above Delegates, whose opinions, we have reason to conclude, agree with ours on this important subject. We are, Gentlemen, your most humble Servants, By order of the Committee, JER. VAN RENSSELAER, Chairman, MAT. VISSCHER, Clerk. The Subscribers being of opinion, that the Reasons abovementioned, are conclusive against adopting the New Constitution without previous amendments, recommend the above named Gentlemen, as Candidates for Members of Convention, and the following, for Members of Senate and Assembly: to wit, Peter Van Ness, for Senator; John Lansing, jun. Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, Cornelius Van Dyck, John Duncan, John Thompson, Henry K. Van Rensselaer, and John Younglove, for Assemblymen. Jacob C. Ten Eyck, Robert Lansing, John R. Bleecker John Price, Gerrit Lansing, jun. Arie Lagrange, Cornelius K. Van Den Berg, Henry Lansing, Abraham Yates, jun. Jacob G. Lansing, Gysbert Fonda, John W. Wendell, Cornelius Wendell, Abm. Bloodgood, Volkert A. Douw, Gysbert Marselus, Abraham Cuyler, Peter W. Yates Henry Ten Eyck,  Dirk B. Van Schoonhoven, Henry Wendell, Jacob Roseboom, Peter W. Douw, Richard Lush, Wm. Mancius, Peter Sharp."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Daily Advertiser,,4/10/1788,"Mr. PRINTER, If you think the following Extract of sufficient importance to the public, you are at liberty to insert it. It is a true copy of the original, verbatim & literatim.1 Extract of a letter, dated Albany, April 3, 1788, to a Gentleman in New-York. “Antifederal measures stands well with us and if we do not relax in our duty there is all hopes that we may carry the day. Altho’ the unremitted exertions that is made by the better sort of people, how stands matters with you in New-York, let me have a line on the subject. We are in close action from morning to night so that little time is spent with me on any other subject I am yrs. &c Jeremiah van Rensselaer"
Broadside,No,A Tenant,,,,4/10/1788,"Permit a fellow tenant to address you in plain language, on the great importance of the next election for delegates in Convention. I am an inhabitant of the county of Albany, and a tenant. My farm is subject to rents and services. These are moderate, nor do I complain that they are exacted with rigor; but such I believe are the natural effects of all tenures, that they produce a kind of dependence, for I have often given my assent to the will of my landlord in supporting his political importance, without enquiring into the propriety of it; nor do I now complain that I hold my farm under him, I inherit it as such, nor do I wish to invade the right or property of another, but to secure my own. Time brings with it experience, and this has at last convinced me that my landlord has been, and may be wrong as well as others—That he may be for a mode of government very convenient for a great man, but not so for a common farmer; in fact, that he may have an interest to support, at the expence of my own, and that whatever be the event of our present contest, I know my rents will be demanded and that I must pay them: I know too, that in voting by ballot, neither my landlord nor any other person can find out how, or for whom I give my vote.2 At the beginning of our troubles with Great-Britain, I was ignorant of my own rights—but the great men of America took pains to inform me in what they consisted. They told me that power in government originated with the people and that the Parliament of Great-Britain had no right to tax us, because the people of America did not chuse them, this was self-evident; and, it convinced me that I had a right to oppose them. Under this firm persuasion, I stepped forward at an early period, to defend my rights, against the British troops. During the long war I was often called into the field, and suffered with others the distresses incident to it. My family were poorly and coarsely cloathed—my sons grew up into manhood without any improvement but in the use of arms—the produce of my farm I freely parted with, to support our army: all this I bore with manly fortitude—My freedom, my farm, and the constitutional rights of my state are secured by the blessings of peace. But our great and rich men are still unsatisfied—They want a new plan of Government—They have by writing, printing and harranging, endeavored to shew it to be good, and the danger if you do not adopt it—you have also heard the many objections which have been made against it—the subject is fairly before you, and I presume that you have read and well considered the arguments for and against it. [1387] You now are to come forward to determine by your votes the fate of yourselves, and your posterity, and I thank kind Heaven, that the appeal is made to you. If therefore you wish to exclude yourselves forever hereafter from voting for an executive and senate; If you wish that the national government shall have the power, by a capitation or poll-tax, to rate the poor equal to the rich; If you chuse to exclude yourselves in civil cases from a trial by jury; If you wish a standing army in time of peace subject to the will of one man; If you wish to be at the expence of following a cause upon an appeal to a far distant country;3 If you will subject yourselves as militia-men to be called abroad to any state in the Union, under the command of continental officers; If you chuse to double the expence of government; If you wish the establishment of a national government with powers to usurp and destroy your constitutional rights and liberties;—Then go and give your votes for the establishment of this New Constitution. But if, on the contrary, you, my fellow tenants, would retain your constitutional rights, and not surrender them to the will and pleasure of a few great and rich men; If you wish the proposed Constitution properly amended before it is adopted—Then let us join our interest in voting for such persons, whose sentiments and principles agree with our own."
Newspaper,No,,,New York Morning Post,,4/11/1788,"By the new system of government, proposed by the late American Convention, the poor Africans (as if the States, in their bustle about liberty, had discovered a right to enslave them) are doomed to endure a continuance of depredation, rapine, and murder, for 21 years to come. The Congress being, for that time, absolutely precluded from interference with that most flagrant violation of natural justice."
Newspaper,No,"A Citizen, A Friend of Good Order",,New York Journal,,4/14/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, I lately came across a handbill, bearing date New-York, June 15, 1776, a period big with the fate of American freedom—a period in which a British fleet and army was hourly expected in this then colony, for the purpose of enforcing upon us the tyrannical mandates of a British administration. On this handbill were enrolled the subsequent list as candidates for seats in the provincial Congress, who were authorised to form a new constitution of government.1 Did they not, my countrymen, act the part of men who loved their country, and []who would sacrifice their peace—their lives to serve it.—I believe not that they have changed their ideas of the worth of freedom and therefore beg leave to nominate them for seats in the ensuing STATE CONVENTION, for the city and county of New York, viz. George Clinton,	 Peter P. Vanzandt, John Jay, Jonathan Lawrence, Robert R.

Newspaper,No,,,Poughkeepsie County Journal,,4/15/1788,"To the Electors of the County of Dutchess, who are opposed to the new Constitution. The important occasion is approaching for the election of Delegates, to deliberate on the propriety of adopting or rejecting the new plan of government. Attempts have been made by several late publications to divide your suffrages, and among other artifices the proposition for amendments has been held up to view—be not deceived by the fallacious idea: after the necessary amendments are made, then will be the proper season for yielding it your unconditional assent. Certainly a system of government which contains such obvious defects as to require immediate correction is unworthy the adoption of a free and enlightened people—be persuaded that the strength of a party in a great measure consists in their unanimity; adhere therefore to this maxim, and you may be assured of success. Impressed with these sentiments, a large number of respectable citizens convened at Barent Viele’s, in Oswego, in February last, for the purpose of nominating candidates to represent the county in Convention; at which meeting the persons whose names are annexed, were unanimously agreed on.1—They are gentlemen who have been uniformly opposed to the new scheme, and are men of known firmness and integrity. At the particular request of many of the persons present at that meeting, they are again recommended to your choice. Delegates for Convention.

Broadside,No,A Plebeian,,,,4/17/1788,"FRIENDS and FELLOW CITIZENS, The advocates for the proposed new constitution, having been beaten off the field of argument, on its merits, have now taken new ground. They admit it is liable to well-founded objections—that a number of its articles ought to be amended; that if alterations do not take place, a door will be left open for an undue administration, and encroachments on the liberties of the people; and many of them go so far as to say, if it should continue for any considerable period, in its present form, it will lead to a subversion of our equal republican forms of government.—But still, although they admit this, they urge that it ought to be adopted, and that we should confide in procuring the necessary alterations after we have received it. Most of the leading characters, who advocate its reception, now profess their readiness to concur with those who oppose it, in bringing about the most material amendments contended for, provided they will first agree to accept the proffered system as it is. These concessions afford strong evidence, that the opposers of the constitution have reason on their side, and that they have not been influenced, in the part they have taken, by the mean and unworthy motives of selfish and private interests with which they have been illiberally charged.—As the favourers of the constitution, seem, if their professions are sincere, to be in a situation similar to that of Agrippa, when he cried out upon Paul’s preaching—“almost thou persuadest me to be a christian,” I cannot help indulging myself in expressing the same wish which St. Paul uttered on that occasion, “Would to God you were not only almost, but altogether such an one as I am.”1 But alas, as we hear no [944]more of Agrippa’s christianity after this interview with Paul, so it is much to be feared, that we shall hear nothing of amendments from most of the warm advocates for adopting the new government, after it gets into operation. When the government is once organized, and all the offices under it filled, the inducements which our great men will have to support it, will be much stronger than they are now to urge its reception. Many of them will then hold places of great honour and emolument, and others will be candidates for such places. It is much harder to relinquish honours or emoluments, which we have in possession, than to abandon the pursuit of them, while the attainment is held in a state of uncertainty.—The amendments contended for as necessary to be made, are of such a nature, as will tend to limit and abridge a number of the powers of the government. And is it probable, that those who enjoy these powers will be so likely to surrender them after they have them in possession, as to consent to have them restricted in the act of granting them? Common sense says—they will not. When we consider the nature and operation of government, the idea of receiving a form radically defective, under the notion of making the necessary amendments, is evidently absurd. Government is a compact entered into by mankind, in a state of society, for the promotion of their happiness. In forming this compact, common sense dictates, that no articles should be admitted that tend to defeat the end of its institution. If any such are proposed, they should be rejected. When the compact is once formed and put into operation, it is too late for individuals to object. The deed is executed—the conveyance is made—and the power of reassuming the right is gone, without the consent of the parties.—Besides, when a government is once in operation, it acquires strength by habit, and stability by exercise. If it is tolerably mild in its administration, the people sit down easy under it, be its principles and forms ever so repugnant to the maxims of liberty.—It steals, by insensible degrees, one right from the people after another, until it rivets its powers so as to put it beyond the ability of the community to restrict or limit it. The history of the world furnishes many instances of a people’s increasing the powers of their rulers by persuasion, but I believe it would be difficult to produce one in which the rulers have been persuaded to relinquish their powers to the people. Wherever this has taken place, it has always been the effect of compulsion. These observations are so well-founded, that they are become a kind of axioms in politics; and the inference to be drawn from them is equally evident, which is this,—that, in forming a government, care should be taken not to confer powers which it will be [945]necessary to take back; but if you err at all, let it be on the contrary side, because it is much easier, as well as safer, to enlarge the powers of your rulers, if they should prove not sufficiently extensive, than it is to abridge them if they should be too great. It is agreed, the plan is defective—that some of the powers granted, are dangerous—others not well defined—and amendments are necessary. Why then not amend it? why not remove the cause of danger, and, if possible, even the apprehension of it? The instrument is yet in the hands of the people; it is not signed, sealed, and delivered, and they have power to give it any form they please. But it is contended, adopt it first, and then amend it. I ask, why not amend, and then adopt it? Most certainly the latter mode of proceeding is more consistent with our ideas of prudence in the ordinary concerns of life. If men were about entering into a contract respecting their private concerns, it would be highly absurd in them to sign and seal an instrument containing stipulations which are contrary to their interests and wishes, under the expectation, that the parties, after its execution, would agree to make alterations agreeable to their desires.—They would insist upon the exceptionable clauses being altered before they would ratify the contract. And is a compact for the government of ourselves and our posterity of less moment than contracts between individuals? certainly not. But to this reasoning, which at first view would appear to admit of no reply, a variety of objections are made, and a number of reasons urged for adopting the system, and afterwards proposing amendments.—Such as have come under my observation, I shall state, and remark upon. It is insisted, that the present situation of our country is such, as not to admit of a delay in forming a new government, or of time sufficient to deliberate and agree upon the amendments which are proper, without involving ourselves in a state of anarchy and confusion On this head, all the powers of rhetoric, and arts of description, are employed to paint the condition of this country, in the most hideous and frightful colours. We are told, that agriculture is without encouragement; trade is languishing; private faith and credit are disregarded, and public credit is prostrate; that the laws and magistrates are contemned and set at nought; that a spirit of licentiousness is rampant, and ready to break over every bound set to it by the government; that private embarrassments and distresses invade the house of every man of middling property, and insecurity threatens every man in affluent circumstances; in short, that we are in a state of the most grievous calamity at home, and that we are contemptible abroad, the scorn of [946]foreign nations, and the ridicule of the world. From this high-wrought picture, one would suppose, that we were in a condition the most deplorable of any people upon earth. But suffer me, my countrymen, to call your attention to a serious and sober estimate of the situation in which you are placed, while I trace the embarrassments under which you labour, to their true sources. What is your condition? Does not every man sit under his own vine and under his own fig-tree, having none to make him afraid?2 Does not every one follow his calling without impediments and receive the reward of his well-earned industry? The farmer cultivates his land, and reaps the fruit which the bounty of heaven bestows on his honest toil. The mechanic is exercised in his art, and receives the reward of his labour. The merchant drives his commerce, and none can deprive him of the gain he honestly acquires; all classes and callings of men amongst us are protected in their various pursuits, and secured by the laws in the possession and enjoyment of the property obtained in those pursuits. The laws are as well executed as they ever were, in this or any other country. Neither the hand of private violence, nor the more to be dreaded hand of legal oppression, are reached out to distress us. It is true, many individuals labour under embarrassments, but these are to be imputed to the unavoidable circumstances of things, rather than to any defect in our governments. We have just emerged from a long and expensive war. During its existence few people were in a situation to encrease their fortunes, but many to diminish them. Debts contracted before the war were left unpaid while it existed, and these were left a burden too heavy to be borne at the commencement of peace. Add to these, that when the war was over, too many of us, instead of reassuming our old habits of frugality and industry, by which alone every country must be placed in a prosperous condition, took up the profuse use of foreign commodities. The country was deluged with articles imported from abroad, and the cash of the country has been sent out to pay for them, and still left us labouring under the weight of a huge debt to persons abroad. These are the true sources to which we are to trace all the private difficulties of individuals: But will a new government relieve you from these? The advocates for it have not yet told you how it will do it—And I will venture to pronounce, that there is but one way in which it can be effected, and that is by industry and economy; limit your expences within your earnings; sell more than you buy, and every thing will be well on this score. Your present condition is such as is common to take place after the conclusion of a war. Those who can remember our situation after the termination of the war preceding the last, will recollect that our condition was similar to [947]the present, but time and industry soon recovered us from it. Money was scarce, the produce of the country much lower than it has been since the peace, and many individuals were extremely embarrassed with debts; and this happened, although we did not experience the ravages, desolations, and loss of property, that were suffered during the late war. With regard to our public and national concerns, what is there in our condition that threatens us with any immediate danger? We are at peace with all the world; no nation menaces us with war; Nor are we called upon by any cause of sufficient importance to attack any nation. The state governments answer the purposes of preserving the peace, and providing for present exigencies. Our condition as a nation is in no respect worse than it has been for several years past. Our public debt has been lessened in various ways, and the western territory, which has always been relied upon as a productive fund to discharge the national debt, has at length been brought to market, and a considerable part actually applied to its reduction.3 I mention these things to shew, that there is nothing special, in our present situation, as it respects our national affairs, that should induce us to accept the proffered system, without taking sufficient time to consider and amend it. I do not mean by this, to insinuate, that our government does not stand in need of a reform. It is admitted by all parties, that alterations are necessary in our federal constitution, but the circumstances of our case do by no means oblige us to precipitate this business, or require that we should adopt a system materially defective. We may safely take time to deliberate and amend, without in the mean time hazarding a condition, in any considerable degree, worse than the present. But it is said, that if we postpone the ratification of this system until the necessary amendments are first incorporated, the consequence will be a civil war among the states. On this head weak minds are alarmed with being told, that the militia of Connecticut and Massachusetts on the one side, and of New-Jersey and Pennsylvania on the other, will attack us with hostile fury; and either destroy us from off the face of the earth, or at best divide us between the two states adjoining us on either side. The apprehension of danger is one of the most powerful incentives to human action, and is therefore generally excited on political questions: But still, a prudent man, though he foreseeth the evil and avoideth it, yet he will not be terrified by imaginary dangers. We ought therefore to enquire what ground there is to fear such an event?—There can be no reason to apprehend, that the other states will make war with us for not receiving the constitution proposed, until it is amended, but from one of the following causes: either that they will have just cause to do it, or that they have a disposition to do it. We [948]will examine each of these:—That they will have no just cause to quarrel with us for not acceding, is evident, because we are under no obligation to do it, arising from any existing compact or previous stipulation. The confederation is the only compact now existing between the states: By the terms of it, it cannot be changed without the consent of every one of the parties to it.4 Nothing therefore can be more unreasonable than for part of the states to claim of the others, as matter of right, an accession to a system to which they have material objections. No war can therefore arise from this principle, but on the contrary, it is to be presumed, it will operate strongly the opposite way.—The states will reason on the subject in the following manner: On this momentous question, every state has an indubitable right to judge for itself: This is secured to it by solemn compact, and if any of our sister states disagree with us upon the question, we ought to attend to their objections, and accommodate ourselves as far as possible to the amendments they propose. As to the inclination of the states to make war with us, for declining to accede, until it is amended, this is highly improbable, not only because such a procedure would be most unjust and unreasonable in itself, but for various other reasons. The idea of a civil war amongst the states is abhorrent to the principles and feelings of almost every man of every rank in the union. It is so obvious to every one of the least reflection, that in such an event we should hazard the loss of all things, without the hope of gaining any thing, that the man who should entertain a thought of this kind, would be justly deemed more fit to be shut up in Bedlam,5 than to be reasoned with. But the idea of one or more states attacking another, for insisting upon alterations in this system, before it is adopted, is more extravagant still; it is contradicting every principle of liberty which has been entertained by the states, violating the most solemn compact, and taking from the state the right of deliberation. Indeed to suppose, that a people, entertaining such refined ideas of the rights of human nature as to be induced to wage war with the most powerful nation on earth, upon a speculative point, and from the mere apprehension of danger only, should so far be lost to their own feelings and principles, as to deny to their brethren, who were associated with them in the arduous conflict, the right of free deliberation on a question of the first importance to their political happiness and safety, is equally an insult to the character of the people of America, and to common sense, and could only be suggested by a vicious heart and a corrupt mind. The idea of being attacked by the other states, will appear visionary and chimerical, if we consider that tho’ several of them have adopted [949]the new constitution, yet the opposition to it has been numerous and formidable. The eastern states from whom we are told we have most to fear, should a civil war be blown up, would have full employ to keep in awe those who are opposed to it in their own governments. Massachusetts, after a long and dubious contest in their convention, has adopted it by an inconsiderable majority, and in the very act has marked it with a stigma in its present form.6 No man of candour, judging from their public proceedings, will undertake to say, on which side the majority of the people are. Connecticut, it is true, have acceded to it, by a large majority of their convention; but it is a fact well known, that a large proportion of the yeomanry of the country are against it:—And it is equally true, that a considerable part of those who voted for it in the convention, wish to see it altered. In both these states the body of the common people, who always do the fighting of a country, would be more likely to fight against than for it: Can it then be presumed, that a country, divided among themselves, upon a question where even the advocates for it, admit the system they contend for needs amendments, would make war upon a sister state, who only insist that that should be done before they receive it, which it is granted ought to be done after, and where it is confessed no obligation lies upon them by compact to do it. Can it, I say, be imagined, that in such a case they would make war on a sister state? The idea is preposterous and chimerical. It is farther urged, we must adopt this plan because we have no chance of getting a better. This idea is inconsistent with the principles of those who advance it. They say, it must be altered, but it should be left until after it is put in operation. But if this objection is valid, the proposal of altering, after it is received, is mere delusion. It is granted, that amendments ought to be made; that the exceptions taken to the constitution, are grounded on just principles, but it is still insisted, that alterations are not to be attempted until after it is received: But why not? Because it is said, there is no probability of agreeing in amendments previous to the adoption, but they may be easily made after it. I wish to be informed what there is in our situation or circumstances that renders it more probable that we shall agree in amendments better after, than before submitting to it? No good reason has as yet been given; it is evident none can be given: On the contrary, there are several considerations which induce a belief, that alterations may be obtained with more ease before, than after its reception, and if so, every one must agree, it is much the safest. The importance of preserving an union, and of establishing a government equal to the purpose of maintaining that union, is a sentiment deeply impressed on [950]the mind of every citizen of America. It is now no longer doubted, that the confederation, in its present form, is inadequate to that end: Some reform in our government must take place. In this, all parties agree: It is therefore to be presumed, that this object will be pursued with ardour and perseverance, until it is attained by all parties. But when a government is adopted that promises to effect this, we are to expect the ardour of many, yea, of most people, will be abated;—their exertions will cease, or be languid, and they will sit down easy, although they may see, that the constitution which provides for this, does not sufficiently guard the rights of the people, or secure them against the encroachments of their rulers. The great end they had in view, the security of the union, they will consider effected, and this will divert their attention from that which is equally interesting, safety to their liberties. Besides, the human mind cannot continue intensely engaged for any great length of time upon one object. As after a storm, a calm generally succeeds, so after the minds of a people have been ardently employed upon a subject, especially upon that of government, we commonly find that they become cool and inattentive: Add to this, that those in the community who urge the adoption of this system, because they hope by it to be raised above the common level of their fellow citizens; because they expect to be among the number of the few who will be benefitted by it, will more easily be induced to consent to the amendments before it is received than afterwards. Before its reception, they will be inclined to be pliant and condescending; if they cannot obtain all they wish, they will consent to take less. They will yield part to obtain the rest. But when the plan is once agreed to, they will be tenacious of every power, they will strenuously contend to retain all they have got; this is natural to human nature, and it is consonant to the experience of mankind. For history affords us no examples of persons once possessed of power, resigning it willingly. The reasonings made use of to persuade us, that no alterations can be agreed upon previous to the adoption of the system, are as curious as they are futile. It is alledged, that there was great diversity of sentiments in forming the proposed constitution; that it was the effect of mutual concessions and a spirit of accommodation, and from hence it is inferred, that farther changes cannot be hoped for. I should suppose that the contrary inference was the fair one. If the convention, who framed this plan, were possessed of such a spirit of moderation and condescension, as to be induced to yield to each other certain points, and to accommodate themselves to each other’s opinions, and even prejudices, there is reason to expect, that this same spirit will continue and prevail in a future convention, and produce an union of sentiments [951]on the points objected to. There is the more reason to hope for this, because the subject has received a full discussion, and the minds of the people much better known than they were when the convention sat. Previous to the meeting of the convention, the subject of a new form of government had been little thought of, and scarcely written upon at all. It is true, it was the general opinion, that some alterations were requisite in the federal system. This subject had been contemplated by almost every thinking man in the union. It had been the subject of many well-written essays, and was the anxious wish of every true friend to America. But it never was in the contemplation of one in a thousand of those who had reflected on the matter, to have an entire change in the nature of our federal government—to alter it from a confederation of states, to that of one entire government, which will swallow up that of the individual states. I will venture to say, that the idea of a government similar to the one proposed, never entered the mind of the legislatures who appointed the convention, and of but very few of the members who composed it, until they had assembled and heard it proposed in that body: much less had the people any conception of such a plan until after it was promulgated. While it was agitated, the debates of the convention were kept an impenetrable secret, and no opportunity was given for well informed men to offer their sentiments upon the subject. The system was therefore never publicly discussed, nor indeed could be, because it was not known to the people until after it was proposed. Since that, it has been the object of universal attention—it has been thought of by every reflecting man—been discussed in a public and private manner, in conversation and in print; its defects have been pointed out, and every objection to it stated; able advocates have written in its favour, and able opponents have written against it. And what is the result? It cannot be denied but that the general opinion is, that it contains material errors, and requires important amendments. This then being the general sentiment, both of the friends and foes of the system, can it be doubted, that another convention would concur in such amendments as would quiet the fears of the opposers, and effect a great degree of union on the subject?—An event most devoutly to be wished. But it is farther said, that there can be no prospect of procuring alterations before it is acceded to, because those who oppose it do not agree among themselves with respect to the amendments that are necessary. To this I reply, that this may be urged against attempting alterations after it is received, with as much force as before; and therefore, if it concludes any thing, it is, that we must receive any system of government proposed to us, because those who object to it do not entirely concur in their objections. But the assertion is not true to any [952]considerable extent. There is a remarkable uniformity in the objections made to the constitution, on the most important points. It is also worthy of notice, that very few of the matters found fault with in it, are of a local nature, or such as affect any particular state; on the contrary, they are such as concern the principles of general liberty, in which the people of New-Hampshire, New-York, and Georgia are equally interested. It would be easy to shew, that in the leading and most important objections that have been made to the plan, there has been, and is an entire concurrence of opinion among writers, and in public bodies throughout the United States. I have not time fully to illustrate this by a minute narration of particulars; but to prove that this is the case, I shall adduce a number of important instances. It has been objected to the new system, that it is calculated to, and will effect such a consolidation of the States, as to supplant and overturn the state governments. In this the minority of Pennsylvania, the opposition in Massachusetts, and all the writers of any ability or note in Philadelphia, New-York, and Boston concur. It may be added, that this appears to have been the opinion of the Massachusetts convention, and gave rise to that article in the amendments proposed, which confines the general government to the exercise only of powers expressly given.7 It has been said, that the representation in the general legislature is too small to secure liberty, or to answer the intention of representation. In this there is an union of sentiments in the opposers. The constitution has been opposed, because it gives to the legislature an unlimited power of taxation, both with respect to direct and indirect taxes, a right to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises of every kind and description, and to any amount. In this, there has been as general a concurrence of opinion as in the former. The opposers to the constitution have said that it is dangerous, because the judicial power may extend to many cases which ought to be reserved to the decision of the State courts, and because the right of trial by jury, is not secured in the judicial courts of the general government, in civil cases. All the opposers are agreed in this objection. The power of the general legislature to alter and regulate the time, place, and manner of holding elections, has been stated as an argument against the adoption of the system. It has been urged, that this power will place in the hands of the general government, the authority, whenever they shall be disposed, and a favorable opportunity offers, to deprive the body of the people, in effect, of all share in the government. [953]The opposers to the constitution universally agree in this objection, and of such force is it, that most of its ardent advocates admit its validity, and those who have made attempts to vindicate it, have been reduced to the necessity of using the most trifling arguments to justify it. The mixture of legislative, judicial, and executive powers in the senate; the little degree of responsibility under which the great officers of government will be held; and the liberty granted by the system to establish and maintain a standing army, without any limitation or restriction, are also objected to the constitution; and in these, there is a great degree of unanimity of sentiment in the opposers. From these remarks it appears, that the opponents to the system accord in the great and material points on which they wish amendments. For the truth of the assertion, I appeal to the protest of the minority of the convention of Pennsylvania,8 to all the publications against the constitution, and to the debates of the convention of Massachusetts.9 As a higher authority than these, I appeal to the amendments proposed by the Massachusetts [Convention]; these are to be considered as the sense of that body upon the defects of the system. And it is a fact, which I will venture to assert, that a large majority of that convention were of opinion, that a number of additional alterations ought to be made.10 Upon reading the articles which they propose as amendments, it will appear, that they object to indefinite powers in the legislature—to the power of laying direct taxes—to the authority of regulating elections—to the extent of the judicial powers, both as it respects the inferior courts and the appellate jurisdiction—to the smallness of the representation, &c—It is admitted, that some writers have advanced objections that others have not noticed—that exceptions have been taken by some, that have not been insisted upon by others, and it is probable, that some of the opponents may approve what others will reject. But still these differences are on matters of small importance, and of such a nature as the persons who hold different opinions will not be tenacious of. Perfect uniformity of sentiment on so great a political subject is not to be expected. Every sensible man is impressed with this idea, and is therefore prepared to make concessions and accommodate on matters of small importance. It is sufficient that we agree in the great leading principles, which relate to the preservation of public liberty and private security. And on these I will venture to affirm we are as well agreed, as any people ever were on a question of this nature. I dare pronounce, that were the principal advocates for the proposed plan to write comments upon it, they would differ more in the sense they would give the constitution, than those who oppose it do, in the amendments they would wish. I am justified in this opinion, [954]by the sentiments advanced by the different writers in favour of the constitution. It is farther insisted, that six states have already adopted the constitution; that probably nine will agree to it: in which case it will be put in operation. That it is unreasonable to expect that those states which have acceded to it, will reconsider the subject in compliance with the wishes of a minority. To perceive the force of this objection, it is proper to review the conduct and circumstances of the states which have acceded to it. It cannot be controverted, that Connecticut and New-Jersey were very much influenced in their determinations on the question, by local considerations. The duty of impost laid by this state, has been a subject of complaint by those states. The new constitution transfers the power of imposing these duties from the state to the general government, and carries the proceeds to the use of the union, instead of that of those state[s]. This is a very popular matter with the people of those states, and at the same time, is not advanced by the sensible opposers to the system in this state as an objection to it.—To excite in the minds of the people of these states an attachment to the new system, the amount of the revenue arising from our impost has been magnified to a much larger sum than it produces; it has been stated to amount to from sixty to eighty thousand pounds lawful money: and a gentleman of high eminence in Connecticut has lent the authority of his name to support it. It has been said, that Connecticut pays a third of this sum annually for impost,11 and Jersey nearly as much. It has farther been asserted, that the avails of the impost were applied to the separate use of the state of New-York. By these assertions the people have been grossly imposed upon, for neither of them are true. The amount of the revenue from impost for two years past, has not exceeded fifty thousand pounds currency, per annum, and a draw-back of duties is allowed by law, upon all goods exported to either of the beforementioned states, in casks or packages unbroken.12 The whole of this sum, and more, has been paid into the federal treasury for the support of the government of the union.13 All the states therefore have actually derived equal benefit with the state of New-York, from the impost. It may be said, I know, that this state has obtained credit for the amount, upon the requisitions of Congress: It is admitted; but still it is a fact, that other states, and especially those who complain, have paid no part of the monies required of them, and have scarcely made an effort to do it.14 The fact therefore is, that they have received as much advantage from the impost of this state, as we ourselves have. The proposed constitution directs to no mode, in which the deficiencies of states on former requisitions, are to be collected, but seems to [955]hold out the idea, that we are to start anew, and all past payments be forgotten. It is natural to expect, that selfish motives will have too powerful an influence on mens minds, and that too often, they will shut the eyes of a people to their best and true interest. The people of those states have been persuaded to believe, that this new constitution will relieve them from the burden of taxes, by providing for all the exigencies of the union, by duties which can be raised only in the neighbouring states. When they come to be convinced, that this promise is a mere delusion, as they assuredly will, by finding the continental tax-gatherer knocking at their doors, if not before, they will be among the first to urge amendments, and perhaps the most violent to obtain them. But notwithstanding the local prejudices which operate upon the people of these states, a considerable part of them wish for amendments. It is not to be doubted, that a considerable majority of the people of Connecticut wish for them, and many in Jersey have the same desires, and their numbers are increasing. It cannot be disputed, that amendments would accord with the sentiments of a great majority in Massachusetts, or that they would be agreeable to the greater part of the people of Pennsylvania: There is no reason to doubt but that they would be agreeable to Delaware and Georgia—If then, the states who have already ratified the constitution, are desirous to have alterations made in it, what reason can be assigned why they should not cordially meet with overtures for that purpose from any state, and concur in appointing a convention to effect it? Mankind are easily induced to fall upon measures to obtain an object agreeable to them. In this case, the states would not only be moved by this universal principle of human nature, but by the strong and powerful motive of uniting all the states under a form of government agreeable to them. I shall now dismiss the consideration of objections made to attempting alterations previous to the adoption of the plan, but before I close, I beg your indulgence, while I make some remarks on the splendid advantages, which the advocates for this system say are to be derived from it.—Hope and fear are two of the most active principles of our nature: We have considered how the latter is addressed on this occasion, and with how little reason: It will appear that the promises it makes, are as little to be relied upon, as its threatenings. We are amused with the fair prospects that are to open, when this government is put into operation—Agriculture is to flourish, and our fields to yield an hundred fold—Commerce is to expand her wings, and bear our productions to all the ports in the world—Money is to pour into our country through every channel—Arts and manufactures are to rear their heads, and every mec[h]anic find full employ—Those who are in debt, are to find easy means to procure money to pay them—Public burdens [956]and taxes are to be lightened, and yet all our public debts are soon to be discharged.—With such vain and delusive hopes are the minds of many honest and well meaning people fed, and by these means are they led inconsiderately to contend for a government, which is made to promise what it cannot perform; while their minds are diverted from contemplating its true nature, or considering whether it will not endanger their liberties, and work oppression. Far be it from me to object to granting the general government the power of regulating trade, and of laying imposts and duties for that purpose, as well as for raising a revenue: But it is as far from me to flatter people with hopes of benefits to be derived from such a change in our government, which can never be realized. Some advantages may accrue from vesting in one general government, the right to regulate commerce, but it is a vain delusion to expect any thing like what is promised. The truth is, this country buys more than it sells: It imports more than it exports. There are too many merchants in proportion to the farmers and manufacturers. Until these defects are remedied, no government can relieve us. Common sense dictates, that if a man buys more than he sells, he will remain in debt; the same is true of a country.—And as long as this country imports more goods than she exports—the overplus must be paid for in money or not paid at all. These few remarks may convince us, that the radical remedy for the scarcity of cash is frugality and industry. Earn much and spend little, and you will be enabled to pay your debts, and have money in your pockets; and if you do not follow this advice, no government that can be framed, will relieve you. As to the idea of being relieved from taxes by this government, it is an affront to common sense, to advance it. There is no complaint made against the present confederation more justly founded than this, that it is incompetent to provide the means to discharge our national debt, and to support the national government. Its inefficacy to these purposes, which was early seen and felt, was the first thing that suggested the necessity of changing the government; other things, it is true, were afterwards found to require alterations; but this was the most important, and accordingly we find, that while in some other things the powers of this government seem to be in some measure limitted, on the subject of raising money, no bounds are set to it. It is authorised to raise money to any amount, and in any way it pleases. If then, the capital embarrassment in our present government arises from the want of money, and this constitution effectually authorises the raising of it, how are the taxes to be lessened by it? Certainly money can only be raised by taxes of some kind or other; it must be got either by additional [957]impositions on trade, by excise, or by direct taxes, or what is more probable, by all together. In either way, it amounts to the same thing, and the position is clear, that as the necessities of the nation require more money than is now raised, the taxes must be enhanced. This you ought to know, and prepare yourselves to submit to.—Besides, how is it possible that the taxes can be decreased when the expences of your government will be greatly advanced? It does not require any great skill in politics, or ability at calculation to shew, that the new government will cost more money to administer it, than the present. I shall not descend to an estimate of the cost of a federal town, the salaries of the president, vice-president, judges, and other great officers of state, nor calculate the amount of the pay the legislature will vote themselves, or the salaries that will be paid the innumerable revenue and subordinate officers. The bare mention of these things is sufficient to convince you, that the new government will be vastly more expensive than the old: And how is the money to answer these purposes to be obtained? It is obvious, it must be taken out of the pockets of the people, by taxes, in some mode or other. Having remarked upon the arguments which have been advanced, to induce you to accede to this government, without amendments, and I trust refuted them, suffer me to close with an address dedicated by the affection of a brother, and the honest zeal of a lover of his country. Friends, countrymen, and fellow citizens, The present is the most important crisis at which you ever have arrived. You have before you a question big with consequences, unutterably important to yourselves, to your children, to generations yet unborn, to the cause of liberty and of mankind; every motive of religion and virtue, of private happiness and public good, of honour and dignity, should urge you to consider cooly and determine wisely. Almost all the governments that have arisen among mankind, have sprung from force and violence. The records of history inform us of none that have been the result of cool and dispassionate reason and reflection: It is reserved for this favoured country to exhibit to mankind the first example.—This opportunity is now given us, and we are to exercise our rights in the choice of persons to represent us in convention, to deliberate and determine upon the constitution proposed: It will be to our everlasting disgrace to be indifferent on such a subject, for it is impossible, we can contemplate any thing that relates to the affairs of this life of half the importance. You have heard that both sides on this great question, agree, that there are in it great defects; yet the one side tell you, choose such men [958]as will adopt it, and then amend it—while the other say, amend previous to its adoption.—I have stated to you my reasons for the latter, and I think they are unanswerable.—Consider you the common people, the yeomanry of the country, for to such I principally address myself, you are to be the principal losers, if the constitution should prove oppressive: When a tyranny is established, there are always masters as well as slaves; the great and the well-born are generally the former, and the middling class the latter—Attempts have been made, and will be repeated, to alarm you with the fear of consequences; but reflect, there are consequences on both sides, and none can be apprehended more dreadful, than entailing on ourselves and posterity a government which will raise a few to the height of human greatness and wealth, while it will depress the many to the extreme of poverty and wretchedness. Consequences are under the controul of that all-wise and all-powerful being, whose providence directs the affairs of men: Our part is to act right, and we may then have confidence that the consequences will be favourable. The path in which you should walk is plain and open before you; be united as one man, and direct your choice to such men as have been uniform in their opposition to the proposed system in its present form, or without proper alterations: In men of this description you have reason to place confidence, while on the other hand, you have just cause to distrust those who urge the adoption of a bad constitution, under the delusive expectation of making amendments after it is acceded to. Your jealousy of such characters should be the more excited, when you consider that the advocates for the constitution have shifted their ground. When men are uniform in their opinions, it affords evidence that they are sincere: When they are shifting, it gives reason to believe, they do not change from conviction. It must be recollected, that when this plan was first announced to the public, its supporters cried it up as the most perfect production of human wisdom: It was represented either as having no defects, or if it had, they were so trifling and inconsiderable, that they served only, as the shades in a fine picture, to set off the piece to the greater advantage. One gentleman in Philadelphia went so far, in the ardour of his enthusiasm in its favour, as to pronounce, that the men who formed it were as really under the guidance of Divine Revelation, as was Moses, the Jewish lawgiver.15 Their language is now changed; the question has been discussed; the objections to the plan ably stated, and they are admitted to be unanswerable. The same men who held it almost perfect, now admit it is very imperfect; that it is necessary it should be amended. The only question between us, is simply this: Shall we accede to a bad constitution, under the uncertain prospect of getting it amended, after we have received [959]it, or shall we amend it before we adopt it? Common sense will point out which is the most rational, which is the most secure line of conduct. May heaven inspire you with wisdom, union, moderation and firmness, and give you hearts to make a proper estimate of your invaluable privileges, and preserve them to you, to be transmitted to your posterity unimpaired, and may they be maintained in this our country, while Sun and Moon endure. POSTSCRIPT. Since the foregoing pages have been put to the press, a pamphlet has appeared, entitled, “An address to the people of the state of New-York, on the subject of the new constitution, &c.”16 Upon a cursory examination of this performance (for I have not had leisure to give it more than a cursory examination) it appears to contain little more than declamation and observations that have been often repeated by the advocates of the new constitution. An attentive reader will readily perceive, that almost every thing deserving the name of an argument in this publication, has received consideration, and, I trust, a satisfactory answer in the preceding remarks, so far as they apply to prove the necessity of an immediate adoption of the plan, without amendments. I shall therefore only beg the patience of my readers, while I make a few very brief remarks on this piece. The author introduces his observations with a short history of the revolution, and of the establishment of the present existing federal government. He draws a frightful picture of our condition under the present confederation. The whole of what he says on that head, stripped of its artificial colouring, amounts to this, that the existing system is rather recommendatory than coercive, or that Congress have not, in most cases, the power of enforcing their own resolves. This he calls “a new and wonderful system.” However “wonderful” it may seem, it certainly is not “new.” For most of the federal governments that have been in the world, have been of the same nature.—The United Netherlands are governed on the same plan. There are other governments also now existing, which are in a similar condition with our’s, with regard to several particulars, on account of which this author denominates it “new and wonderful.”—The king of Great-Britain “may make war, but has not power to raise money to carry it on.” He [“]may borrow money, but is without the means of repayment,” &c. For these he is dependent on his parliament. But it is needless to add on this head, because it is admitted that the powers of the general government ought to be increased in several of the particulars this author instances. But these things are mentioned to shew, that the outcry made against [960]the confederation, as being a system new, unheard of, and absurd, is really without foundation. The author proceeds to depicture our present condition in the high-wrought strains common to his party.—I shall add nothing to what I have said on this subject in the former part of this pamphlet, but will only observe, that his imputing our being kept out of the possession of the western posts, and our want of peace with the Algerines, to the defects in our present government, is much easier said than proved. The British keep possession of these posts, because it subserves their interest, and probably will do so, until they perceive that we have gathered strength and resources sufficient to assert our rights with the sword. Let our government be what it will, this cannot be done without time and patience. In the present exhausted situation of the country, it would be madness in us, had we ever so perfect a government, to commence a war for the recovery of these posts.—With regard to the Algerines, there are but two ways in which their ravages can be prevented. The one is, by a successful war against them, and the other is by treaty.17 The powers of Congress under the confederation are completely competent either to declare war against them, or to form treaties. Money, it is true, is necessary to do both these. This only brings us to this conclusion, that the great defect in our present government, is the want of powers to provide money for the public exigencies. I am willing to grant reasonable powers on this score, but not unlimited ones; commercial treaties may be made under the present powers of Congress. I am persuaded we flatter ourselves with advantages which will result from them, that will never be realized. I know of no benefits that we receive from any that have yet been formed. This author tells us, “it is not his design to investigate the merits of the plan, nor of the objections made to it.” It is well he did not undertake it, for if he had, from the specimen he has given, the cause he assumes would not have probably gained much strength by it. He however takes notice of two or three of the many objections brought against the plan. “We are told, (says he) among other strange things, that the liberty of the press is left insecure by the proposed constitution, and yet that constitution says neither more nor less about it, than the constitution of the state of New-York does. We are told it deprives us of trial by jury, whereas the fact is, that it expressly secures it in certain cases, and takes it away in none, &c. it is absurd to construe the silence of this, or of our own constitution relative to a great number of our rights into a total extinction of them; silence and a blank paper neither grant nor take away any thing.” It may be a strange thing to this author to hear the people of America anxious for the preservation of their rights, but those who understand the true principles of liberty, are no strangers to their importance. The man who supposes the constitution, in any part of it, is like a blank piece of paper, has very erroneous ideas of it. He may be assured every clause has a meaning, and many of them such extensive meaning, as would take a volume to unfold. The suggestion, that the liberty of the press is secure, because it is not in express words spoken of in the constitution, and that the trial by jury is not taken away, because it is not said in so many words and letters it is so, is puerile and unworthy of a man who pretends to reason. We contend, that by the indefinite powers granted to the general government, the liberty of the press may be restricted by duties, &c. and therefore the constitution ought to have stipulated for its freedom. The trial by jury, in all civil cases is left at the discretion of the general government, except in the supreme court on the appellate jurisdiction, and in this I affirm it is taken away, not by express words, but by fair and legitimate construction and inference; for the supreme court have expressly given them an appellate jurisdiction, in every case to which their powers extend (with two or three exceptions) both as to law and fact. The court are the judges; every man in the country, who has served as a juror, knows, that there is a distinction between the court and the jury, and that the lawyers in their pleading, make the distinction. If the court, upon appeals, are to determine both the law and the fact, there is no room for a jury, and the right of trial in this mode is taken away. The author manifests equal levity in referring to the constitution of this state, to shew that it was useless to stipulate for the liberty of the press, or to insert a bill of rights in the constitution. With regard to the first, it is perhaps an imperfection in our constitution that the liberty of the press is not expressly reserved; but still there was not equal necessity of making this reservation in our State as in the general Constitution, for the common and statute law of England, and the laws of the colony are established,18 in which this privilege is fully defined and secured. It is true, a bill of rights is not prefixed to our constitution, as it is in that of some of the states; but still this author knows, that many essential rights are reserved in the body of it;19 and I will promise, that every opposer of this system will be satisfied, if the stipulations that they contend for are agreed to, whether they are prefixed, affixed, or inserted in the body of the constitution, and that they will not contend which way this is done, if it be but done. I shall add but one remark, and that is upon the hackneyed argument introduced by the author, [962]drawn from the character and ability of the framers of the new constitution. The favourers of this system are not very prudent in bringing this forward. It provokes to an investigation of characters, which is an invidious task. I do not wish to detract from their merits, but I will venture to affirm, that twenty assemblies of equal number might be collected, equally respectable both in point of ability, integrity, and patriotism. Some of the characters which compose it I revere; others I consider as of small consequence, and a number are suspected of being great public defaulters,20 and to have been guilty of notorious peculation and fraud, with regard to public property in the hour of our distress. I will not descend to personalities, nor would I have said so much on the subject, had it not been in self defence. Let the constitution stand on its own merits. If it be good, it stands not in need of great men’s names to support it. If it be bad, their names ought not to sanction it. FINIS."
Newspaper,No,Marcus,,New York Journal,,4/18/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, By inserting the following you will much oblige a SUBSCRIBER. My fellow Citizens, Now is the important moment for exertion. Let not an opportunity so interesting as the present, be treated with neglect. Several respectable characters have been recommended to you as fit objects for the convention, soon to be convened;—which convention is to determine the important question, whether you shall remain freemen or not!—Whether you shall enjoy the happy effects of independence, or sink into the very same ditch of misery, which the hand of British cruelty endeavoured to plunge you, and which you so nobly and justly defended. [1502page icon]Let, my brethren, the idea of liberty inspire your souls and burn with ardor in your breasts. If the measures proposed in the general constitution in question, be any ways injurious to our happiness, let us embrace this moment to call forth our best friends, and those only who wish prosperity and happiness to our country: Let us, I beseech you, choose such as members for the convention."
Broadside,No,Albany Anti-Federal Committee,,,Albany Federal Committee,4/23/1788,"To the Citizens of the City and County of Albany. Another publication of the Federal Committee, has at length, but with difficulty, been obtained in this city, though copies of it have for sometime circulated in every part of the county, to be read only by the trusty and well beloved of the Federal Committee, but not to be delivered to any but such who were of approved fidelity. This elegant performance, while it imputes to us lameness and confusion, and publishes to the world, that our last address contains the last words and dying speech of an expiring party, speaks in every line, the language of disappointment; and while it declares, that the Federalists, as a body, have ever held themselves superior to retorting on us; from that fancied superiority, they look down with pity and contempt, upon those they cannot persuade to think with them, and lavish abuse, in the certain persuasion that, as we were otherwise employed, we should not have leisure to resent it. The Federal Committee, as a body, published some abusive, false and injurious imputations, on those who were against adopting the New Constitution with amendments2—They have, as a body, countenanced, unprovoked and undeserved, attacks on individuals, who are opposed to the New Constitution—This is not mere assertion, the proofs are in our power, and some of them rest in the recollection of almost every man who has read the newspapers printed in this county. We will relate in a few words a matter, which it is necessary, on this occasion, the public should be acquainted with, as it explains the management of the Federalists.—When the New Constitution became a particular object of enquiry, several publications, personal in their nature, and confessedly false as to their subject, were successively given to the public, to hurt the feelings and injure the characters of several persons [1406]who, it was supposed, would oppose the adoption of the New Constitution—This was often complained of without effect—At last the nomination of the Federal Committee made its appearance, with remarks, announcing to the public the characters who were excluded from the list of Candidates.3 Let every impartial man review the Federal publications before that period, and he will observe them filled with the most venomous invectives against the Anti-Federalists, collectively and individually; all which was silently submitted to, till the Federal Committee shewed that they meant to pursue the same line of conduct—Then, and not till then, were their iniquities visited on their own heads4—they felt sore—a compromise took place, and it was agreed that all personalities should cease. They did so for a considerable time. This is proof conclusive, that the Members of the Federal Committee or some of them, were privy to those publications and influenced them—If not, how could they stop these publications? If they could stop them, why was not this done sooner? The reason is clear—as long as the Federalists remained untouched, they were content to let their scurrility go on without interruption—But the instant personalities were retorted on them, and applied to their feelings, they shrunk from them with the most undisguised abhorrence. If therefore, scurrility reflects dishonor on those who have recourse to it, as it undoubtedly does, all the dishonor may be justly claimed by the Federalists. Terms of distinction, on a difference in political sentiments, are frequently arbitrary, and often, in their origin, without any precise meaning affixed to them. Thus, in the present instance, the term Federalist, is applied to a man who is for destroying the Confederation—That of Anti-Federalist to the one who is for preserving it. It is unnecessary to explain the measures which led to this distinction. The principles of both we are fully acquainted with. We have neither time nor inclination, to answer the remarks which are made respecting the sentiments of individuals—But we make no doubt, that every person who is alluded to, in the last publication of the Federal Committee, can give a satisfactory explanation of the opinions he has maintained. If the term “travelling partizan,” is intended as an odious one, let the men take it to themselves, who have been galloping from this city, in every direction, to the extremities of the county, for the purpose of making proselytes to a cause, which, the good sense of our fellow citizens has, in most instances, induced them to decline approving. A few days will determine whether the Federalists could have procured 400 signers in this city, to the publication subscribed with the [1407]names of Philip Schuyler, Stephen Van Rensselaer, Philip Van Rensselaer, James Van Rensselaer, Abraham Ten Broeck, John Ten Broeck, Dirck Ten Broeck, and others. We doubt it, and we have great reason to believe the Federal Committee did so themselves.—If the names of the persons who were subscribed to that publication were intended to give weight to the arguments of the Federal Committee, adding the name of Mr. [John] Maley to it was an imposition on the public—if not it is only less criminal, as it is more harmless. The name of David Fonda, we are informed, was also added without his privity. It is said a paper, addressed to the inhabitants of Schenectady, has been published by the Federalists, stating the advantages to be derived from the Indian Trade to the inhabitants of that place.5 It need only be observed, that the General Government has a power to establish a monopoly. This the State of Massachusetts apprehended would take place,6 and the conduct of the British officers, at the Western Posts, shews how easily it may be effected. Thus objects are in general presented to you to be viewed on one side only. Examine them with attention on all, and let the result determine your conduct. By order of the Anti-Federal Committee, JER. V. RENSSELAER, Chairman."
Letter,Yes,De Witt Clinton,James Clinton,,,4/25/1788,"… I suppose you have been informed of the late riot in this City.2 It originated from the digging up of the dead by the Physicians and it terminated in the death of three of the living—and in the wounding of several—The Physicians had anatomized and dug up several bodies—but report had magnified their exploits and suspicion had fixed the [acurse?] upon every corpse that was interred—Experiment exposed the falsehood in a great measure and wiped away the imputation of needless and wanton dissection from the characters of the sons of Æsculapius3—for on examining the graves of several reported to have been dug up, their bodies were found undisturbed. The Mob began [on] a Sunday—on Monday they recollected in the fields and proceeded to the house of Dr. Jos. Young—which they searched and then went to Dr. Miller’s—The Governor humored their passions for a while & marched with them to Dr. McKnight’s4—examined his house and endeavored to quiet their minds and pacify their rage—this, however, was found an ineffectual expedient,5 for they threatened to storm the Gaol in which some of the Doctors were lodged for security—this rash step rendered the calling out of the Militia for the protection of the Gaol necessary—they were called out and in going, several of them had their guns broken by the mobility and received great insult—Towards Night others with several respectable Citizens attempted to get in the Gaol and upon being saluted with brickbats and wounded, a few guns were fired of[f] contrary to the Governor’s orders6—shortly after the mob principally dispersed—some respectable characters were wounded—they are not dangerous—the Governor was honored with a brickbat in his side—but it hurt him but little, owning to its striking a Gentleman’s arm before it touched him. I am informed that three of the young Quacks are indicted for their mal-practices. This is as nearly as I can recollect a general account of the riot—I believe it would not [965]have been carried to such a length, if the passions of the people had not been inflamed by exaggerated accounts of the surgical experiments—if the Rioters had not thought, that the Militia would not fire—and if several of them had not been drunk—I imagine the affair will never recommence. I seen Genl. Hathorn7 to day but had only time to say how do you do—It is supposed that antifederalism will prevail in the doubtful Counties of Albany and Columbia—both parties are industrious—If the Constitution is adopted, I am convinced that several people who now warmly advocate its adoption will exclaim—“From the insolence of great men—from the tyranny of the rich—from the unfeeling rapacity of the Excise-man and Tax-gatherer—from the misery of despotism—from the expence of supporting standing Armies, Navies, Placemen, sinecures, federal cities Senators, Presidents and a long train of etceteras Good Lord deliver us”—There is as yet no prospect of its being ratified— N. B. I sent you for distribution a bundle of pamphlets by Coll. Denniston8—I hope it is done—I now send you Newspapers—My [– – –] [George?] wrote to me."
Broadside,No,Albany Anti-Federal Committee,,,Albany Federal Committee,4/28/1788,"To the Citizens of the City and County of Albany. At this late day, it is impossible to enter into a minute consideration of the address to you from the Federal Committee—From its title page, it imports to be a refutation of the objections offered by us to the New Constitution in its present form: but when we examine it with attention, we find it to consist chiefly of positive assertions, without any arguments to support them—unmeaning denials, or reluctant admissions of points which have been stated by us, and which the force of truth ought and will, sooner or later, carry home to the bosom of every man who is in the least degree disposed to a dispassionate enquiry. Among their admissions in the 6th page, is a concession, that if nine states ratify the New Government, the others may remain independent, though policy must dictate to all of them eventually to join the Union. They have, it seems, at last discovered, that we may think for ourselves, [1409]and that should we not be able to prevail upon our sister states to join us in opinion, we may still join the Union at any future day, after we have discovered that our attempts to procure amendments are unavailing. The objection that the powers of the General Government are not defined, is answered in the 6th page, by saying that it will equally apply to our state government, without attending to this essential difference, that in our state government, the right of election is secured to the people, to be exercised in the different counties, but, it is not so by the new system. The Federal Committee have at last discovered, that our state officers have (a) never acted corruptly—they have also discovered(b) that taxation and representation ought to be in proportion, and if so (so the same reasoning must apply to individuals) one of that Committee who has more wealth, and consequently ought to pay more taxes than all the rest of the Committee and signers of that address collectively, ought to give more votes than all the rest of them—this is a very convenient doctrine for the rich, but the citizens who are poor or in midling circumstances of life, will not agree to it—The language to those citizens who are not rich is, take your choice, pay an equal tax with a man who holds ten times your property, or give up a proportion of your importance in this government—This idea connected with that in the 10th page, that the southern states must ever be against a poll-tax, because their slaves are to be taken into the computation, need only to be mentioned, to induce every man of sense to laugh at the attempts of a set of men, who advance such glaring inconsistencies. If, at all events, the southern states must contribute towards the general expence in proportion to the number of their inhabitants, three fifths of the slaves included, now can their interests, as states, be affected whether that proportion of the general expence is raised in each state by a poll-tax or by assessment. To the states it is of no consequence—to the very rich men of those states, as well as of the others, it will ever be considered as of the first importance. In the 17th page it is asserted that, as nothing is said to prevent a jury in cases of appeal, it must remain to be established by future laws. The Emperor of Morocco may order a trial by jury; but if he is not disposed to do it, nobody can controul him—and his people must be content.—We are freemen, and for every right we give up, we ought to have some adequate advantage secured—But what can compensate for the loss of a right of being tried by our equals?—Need an answer be given to this question, when addressed to men who have held the deprivation of the right of trial by jury as one of the most important reasons for waging [1410]a long and bloody war, against a King who had made some progress in invading it—we trust not. It is said the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is limitted—One instance is sufficient to shew how easily this limitation may be avoided—If two men, citizens of this state and inhabitants of it, claim land under titles unquestionably derived from this state—one of them, by making a title to a citizen of a neighboring state, merely to have the benefit of a trial in the great Federal courts without a jury carries his point beyond a doubt. A thousand other instances may be given, in which the same object may be obtained in as direct a mode—And if the controversy should not happen to be between “two rich men, merchants or great landholders,” but between one of this description and a man of moderate property, would it not be the wiser mode, if the New Constitution takes place, for the latter to give up his right, than to risk the certain loss of at least the whole property in contest, with a chance of losing more? Standing armies, the right of calling out and directing the militia, and a variety of other powers, important in their nature, are more or less dangerous under every form of government—but they are rendered less so, while the people are certain of retaining free elections. The reason given by the Federal Committee, in the 9th page, for permitting the general Government to interfere in elections, that some of the states might refuse to elect Members of the Legislature, is the only one which will justify their interposition at all: But was it necessary to give them the uncontrouled right of making regulations respecting the manner, time and place of holding elections? Would not a power to direct an election in the manner and at the place in which the last preceding election was held, and a right to fix the same day of election on which the last annual election was held, if the state should neglect either, answer the purpose?—Cannot the general Legislature, with the present powers, in fact, abolish free elections? They can unquestionably. This, combined with a number of other dangerous powers, may enable the general Government to take away our liberties, whenever the members find or think their interest may be promoted by it.—This has been done in every other part of the world, and we have men not less wicked, ambitious, and enterprising among us than other nations. Wherever the advocates for the New Constitution were defective in reasoning on it, they have uniformly supplied the deficiency by abuse. But your attention has been too long diverted from the great question, whether you will still continue to exist as a free and happy people, or be reduced to the same situation with almost all the other nations on earth. A number of persons have been brought forward by the Federalists [1411]as approving the New Constitution. If their sentiments or examples are to have weight, it must be considered— 1st. Whether they have not some particular object to obtain at the expence of the citizens at large. 2dly. Whether they think for themselves: and 3dly. Whether they are better informed than you are. Before you put implicit faith in their opinions, consider their situation, ability and characters with attention—take from them first, the men who are possessed of over grown fortunes—secondly, those you have reason to think are influenced by others—thirdly those who are not possessed of information superior to your own, and pay that deference to the remainder which one freeman will always unreluctantly afford another.—Consider their arguments—If they deserve weight, let them have it—but if not, think for yourselves, and reject the council dictated by interested, designing or ignorant persons. It has been boasted that three fourths of the inhabitants of this city are in favor of the New Constitution—If it is so, why have not the Federal Committee, whose exertions have been unremitting, to effect it, procured them to subscribe to their certificate, at the bottom of their elaborate pamphlet?—Why have they given you the names of persons who disavow the sentiments contained in it, as approving them?—why have they given you the name of a man, as subscribing it, who has been at New-York for three weeks last past? Have you reason to place much confidence in the testimonial, with which they have furnished you, when you are informed, that five of the persons whose names appear as subscribers to the last extraordinary production of the Federal Committee, publicly declare, that they were unacquainted with its import, or they would not have signed it, and that some of those persons declare, that the paper they signed did not contain above three or four lines?—Have you reason to trust to the declaration, that three fourths of the inhabitants of this city approve of the New Constitution in its present form, when you find the name of Mr. John Maley among the subscribers, who, it is notoriously known, has been three weeks absent at New York?—What is the inference? Either that they considered the acquisition of one name of so much consequence, as to induce them to send all the way to New York to obtain it, or that it has been annexed without his privity or consent. If the former, it exposes the weakness of the Federalists in this city, and pointedly contradicts the assertion, that they had a very short time to answer our objections; for if they had time to send their pamphlet to Mr. Maley at New-York, before it was completed, for his approbation, they certainly ought not to complain, that they had no time to consider its contents, and give it whatever dress they thought [1412]proper—If Mr. Maley never saw the pamphlet, the making use of his name is an imposition, and an insult on the public, which the best cause could not palliate, much less justify. The Federalists have procured the signature of fifteen Scotsmen, to a recommendation of an address of their countrymen Robert R. Livingston, Ph. Van Cortlandt, P. Van Cortlandt, jun. and others; and among those, we have undoubted information, that one of them supposed, when he put his name to it, that it was a compliment in answer to the address from New-York2—How many of the others were properly informed of what they were about, we know not—However, forty one of our fellow citizens of the Scots nation, inhabitants of this city, differ in their opinions with them; and have declared in writing, that they are decided against adopting the New Constitution, unless the intended amendments are made a condition of adoption. But, in a matter of this consequence to ourselves, we must determine as freemen have an undoubted right to do, as sound reason and the prosperity of our country shall dictate—unawed by the insolence of wealth and uninfluenced by the arts or insinuations of the designing—for it is certain, that that government which will most effectually secure our liberties, must ever be the most worthy and desirable object of pursuit, and ought to receive the support of every disinterested friend to his country. By Order of the Anti-Federal Committee, JER. V. RENSSELAER, Chairman. (a) 8th page. (b) 9th page."
Newspaper,No,A Tenant,,New York Journal,,4/29/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, Please to insert in your useful paper the enclosed address to the Tenants of the county of Albany, it is written with candor and judgment, and in the most important parts applies to the cause of every MECHANIC. To the tenants of the county of Albany. Permit a fellow tenant to address you in plain language, on the great importance of the next election for delegates in convention. I am an inhabitant of the county of Albany, and a tenant. My farm is subject to rents and services. These are moderate, nor do I now complain that they are exacted with rigor; but such I believe are the natural effects of all tenures, that they produce a kind of dependence, for I have often given my assent to the will of my landlord in supporting his political importance, without enquiring into the propriety of it; nor do I complain that I hold my farm under him. I inherit it as such, nor do I wish to invade the right or property of another, but to secure my own. Time brings with it experience, and this has at last convinced me that my landlord has been, and may be wrong as well as others—that he may be for a mode of government very convenient for a great man, but not so for a common farmer; in fact, that he may have an interest to support, at the expence of my own, and that whatever be the event of our present contest, I know my rents will be demanded and that I must pay them: I know too, that in voting by ballot, neither my landlord nor any other person can find out how, or for whom I give my vote.2 At the beginning of our troubles with Great-Britain, I was ignorant of my own rights—but the great men of America took pains to inform me in what they consisted. They told me that power in government originated with the people and that the parliament of Great-Britain had no right to tax us, because the people of America did not chuse them, this was self evident; and, it convinced me that I had a right to oppose them. Under this firm persuasion, I stepped forward at an early period, to defend my rights, against the British troops. During the long war I was often called into the field, and suffered with others the distresses incident to it. My family were poorly and coarsely cloathed—my sons grew up into manhood without any improvements but in the use of [967]arms—the produce of my farm I freely parted with, to support our army: all this I bore with manly fortitude—my freedom, my farm, and the constitutional rights of my state are secured by the blessings of peace. But our great and rich men are still unsatisfied; they want a new plan of government. They have by writing, printing and harranging, endeavored to shew it to be good, and the danger if you do not adopt it—you have also heard the many objections which have been made against it—the subject is fairly before you, and I presume that you have read and well considered the arguments for and against it. You now are to come forward to determine by your votes the fate of yourselves, and your posterity, and I thank kind Heaven, that the appeal is made to you. If therefore you wish to exclude yourselves forever hereafter from voting for an executive and senate; If you wish that the national government shall have the power, by a capitation or poll-tax, to rate the poor equal to the rich; If you chuse to exclude yourselves in civil cases from a trial by jury; If you wish a standing army in time of peace subject to the will of one man; If you wish to be at the expence of following a cause upon an appeal to a far distant country; If you will subject yourselves as militiamen to be called abroad to any state in the union, under the command of continental officers; If you chuse to double the expence of government; If you wish the establishment of a national government with powers to usurp and destroy your constitutional rights and liberties; then go and give your votes for the establishment of this new constitution. But if, on the contrary, you, my fellow tenants, would retain your constitutional rights, and not surrender them to the will and pleasure of a few great and rich men. If you wish the proposed constitution properly amended before it is adopted; then let us join our interest in voting for such persons whose sentiments and principles agree with our own."
Newspaper,No,Detector,,New York Journal,,5/1/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, We are told, that the Maryland convention, without a greater exception than eight or ten members, are for adopting the new constitution! ⟨Ha, ha, hah!⟩ This I eagerly revolved in my mind, being in some measure astonished—nor will I believe it until better authenticated. ⟨Ha, ha, hah!⟩ I remember a circumstance which took [970]place at Boston! On the very eve of their convention’s adopting the constitution, reports were busily circulated, and it was exultingly inserted in several of the Boston papers, that the convention of North-Carolina had ratified the constitution.2 ⟨Ha, ha, hah!⟩ Without examining whether the convention was in session or not, full credence was given to this report; and after the adoption of the constitution, it was discovered, that the North Carolina convention were not to set until July! ⟨HA, HA, HAH!⟩ Judge ye, who will, of the intention of this report. Whether the reports from Maryland are designed to unduly bias the present election, I will not affirm, but I profess, that no other rational reason can be given, as it is known that a great number of the members in that convention are strongly opposed to the constitution, in its present form. ⟨Ha, ha, hah! Eleven only!⟩ 29th April. "
Newspaper,No,A Sincere Federalist,,New York Journal,,5/1/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, The federal ticket2 for the assembly is poisoned by the name of a man, whose mind is as dirty with avarice, as Rolten Row used to be with excrement,3 or our late surgeons-hall was, with putrid entrails.—This man would a second time betray the Messiah for less than thirty pieces of silver.4—The devil once tempted Christ with a view of a pleasant tract of land, and he refused him the required homage.5 If Satan was to shew him a goodly location he would reverently bow his aukward head and kiss his black * *. He now enjoys the estate of an inoffensive tory, and these people he now courts with unblushing impudence and spaniel servility; he robs them of the substance, and now endeavors to amuse an H. & W. with the shadow of legislative honor. The Cincinnati and the soldiers will, it is hoped, remember the rancid pork, the watered whiskey, and the stinted ration."
Newspaper,No,A Spectator,,New York Journal,,5/2/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, Six states have adopted the new Constitution; one hath rejected it,2 and six are still to decide the important question. It appears not improbable from all the informations and accounts published by both parties, but three states of these remaining six, may reject and three adopt it. In this case the constitution will be ratified by nine states, and agreeable to the resolve of the convention,3 the new Congress and president may then be chosen and assemble. It is hardly to be doubted, but they will find it very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to put the new government in execution, unless they adopt the amendments already proposed by Massachusetts,4 and others, which may still be proposed by the remaining states. Indeed no sincere friend to this country can ever wish to see it organized and executed without amendments, for in that case it may justly be expected, that in less than twenty years it would be equally as arbitrary and despotick as that of [973]the republic of Venice. It is however no less true, that a government for the thirteen United States, more efficient and more energetick than the present confederation, is absolutely necessary in every point of view, and it is very doubtful, and scarcely to be expected, that a new convention will ever agree upon such a mode of government, considering the local prejudices, passions, and perhaps powers and restrictions of the several legislatures, with which the members of such a new convention will be possessed.—This being admitted, every real patriot ought to exert himself to have the new government adopted and ratified by nine states, so that the new Congress might be chosen and assemble, who will undoubtedly promote such amendments as will be deemed necessary for the civil, religious and political liberty of each individual state, consistent with the good of the whole union. The four states, who will and ought to reject the constitution as it now stands, together with the powerful minority of some of these states who have adopted it, will compel the new Congress to come to such proposals, for whoever is acquainted with the manners, habits and dispositions of the people, who oppose the new government in its present form, must be sensible and convinced, that it would be nearly impossible to make them comply by force, and by these means it is to be hoped, that all the animosities, quarrels and divisions, now subsisting, would cease and die away, and harmony, concord and unanimity take place, without which this country never can be great nor formidable."
Broadside,No,Federal Farmer,,,,5/2/1788,"LETTER VI. December 25, 1787. Dear Sir, My former letters to you, respecting the constitution proposed, were calculated merely to lead to a fuller investigation of the subject; having more extensively considered it, and the opinions of others relative to it, I shall, in a few letters, more particularly endeavour to point out the defects, and propose amendments. I shall in this make only a few general and introductory observations, which, in the present state of the momentous question, may not be improper; and I leave you, in all cases, to decide by a careful examination of my works, upon the weight of my arguments, the propriety of my remarks, the uprightness of my intentions, and the extent of my candor—I presume I am writing to a man of candor and reflection, and not to an ardent, peevish, or impatient man. When the constitution was first published, there appeared to prevail a misguided zeal to prevent a fair unbiassed examination of a subject of infinite importance to this people and their posterity—to the cause of liberty and the rights of mankind—and it was the duty of those who saw a restless ardor, or design, attempting to mislead the people by a parade of names and misrepresentations, to endeavour to prevent their having their intended effects. The only way to stop the passions of men in their career is, coolly to state facts, and deliberately to avow the truth—and to do this we are frequently forced into a painful view of men and measures. Since I wrote to you in October, I have heard much said, and seen many pieces written, upon the subject in question; and on carefully examining them on both sides, I find much less reason for changing my sentiments, respecting the good and defective parts of the system proposed than I expected—The opposers, as well as the advocates of it, confirm me in my opinion, that this system affords, all circumstances considered, a better basis to build upon than the confederation. And as to the principal defects, as the smallness of the representation, the insecurity of elections, the undue mixture of powers in the senate, the insecurity of some essential rights, &c. the opposition appears, generally, to agree respecting them, and many of the ablest advocates virtually to admit them—Clear it is, the latter do not attempt manfully to defend these defective parts, but to cover them with a mysterious veil; they [980]concede, they retract; they say we could do no better; and some of them, when a little out of temper, and hard pushed, use arguments that do more honor to their ingenuity, than to their candor and firmness. Three states have now adopted the constitution without amendments; these, and other circumstances, ought to have their weight in deciding the question, whether we will put the system into operation, adopt it, enumerate and recommend the necessary amendments, which afterwards, by three-fourths of the states, may be ingrafted into the system, or whether we will make the amendments prior to the adoption—I only undertake to shew amendments are essential and necessary—how far it is practicable to ingraft them into the plan, prior to the adoption, the state conventions must determine. Our situation is critical, and we have but our choice of evils—We may hazard much by adopting the constitution in its present form—we may hazard more by rejecting it wholly—we may hazard much by long contending about amendments prior to the adoption. The greatest political evils that can befal us, are discords and civil wars—the greatest blessings we can wish for, are peace, union, and industry, under a mild, free, and steady government. Amendments recommended will tend to guard and direct the administration—but there will be danger that the people, after the system shall be adopted, will become inattentive to amendments—Their attention is now awake—the discussion of the subject, which has already taken place, has had a happy effect—it has called forth the able advocates of liberty, and tends to renew, in the minds of the people, their true republican jealousy and vigilance, the strongest guard against the abuses of power; but the vigilance of the people is not sufficiently constant to be depended on—Fortunate it is for the body of a people, if they can continue attentive to their liberties, long enough to erect for them a temple, and constitutional barriers for their permanent security: when they are well fixed between the powers of the rulers and the rights of the people, they become visible boundaries, constantly seen by all, and any transgression of them is immediately discovered: they serve as centinels for the people at all times, and especially in those unavoidable intervals of inattention. Some of the advocates, I believe, will agree to recommend good amendments; but some of them will only consent to recommend indefinite, specious, but unimportant ones; and this only with a view to keep the door open for obtaining in some favourable moment, their main object, a complete consolidation of the states, and a government much higher toned, less republican and free than the one proposed. [981] If necessity, therefore, should ever oblige us to adopt the system, and recommend amendments, the true friends of a federal republic must see they are well defined, and well calculated, not only to prevent our system of government moving further from republican principles and equality, but to bring it back nearer to them—they must be constantly on their guard against the address, flattery, and manoeuvres of their adversaries  The gentlemen who oppose the constitution, or contend for amendments in it, are frequently, and with much bitterness, charged with wantonly attacking the men who framed it. The unjustness of this charge leads me to make one observation upon the conduct of parties, &c. Some of the advocates are only pretended federalists; in fact they wish for an abolition of the state governments. Some of them I believe to be honest federalists, who wish to preserve substantially the state governments united under an efficient federal head; and many of them are blind tools without any object. Some of the opposers also are only pretended federalists, who want no federal government, or one merely advisory. Some of them are the true federalists, their object, perhaps, more clearly seen, is the same with that of the honest federalists; and some of them, probably, have no distinct object. We might as well call the advocates and opposers tories and whigs, or any thing else, as federalists and anti-federalists. To be for or against the constitution, as it stands, is not much evidence of a federal disposition; if any names are applicable to the parties, on account of their general politics, they are those of republicans and anti-republicans. The opposers are generally men who support the rights of the body of the people, and are properly republicans. The advocates are generally men not very friendly to those rights, and properly anti-republicans. Had the advocates left the constitution, as they ought to have done, to be adopted or rejected on account of its own merits or imperfections, I do not believe the gentlemen who framed it would ever have been even alluded to in the contest by the opposers. Instead of this, the ardent advocates begun by quoting names as incontestible authorities for the implicit adoption of the system, without any examination—treated all who opposed it as friends of anarchy; and with an indecent virulence addressed M—n G—y, L—e,1 and almost every man of weight they could find in the opposition by name. If they had been candid men they would have applauded the moderation of the opposers for not retaliating in this pointed manner, when so fair an opportunity was given them; but the opposers generally saw that it was no time to heat the passions; but, at the same time, they saw there was [982]something more than mere zeal in many of their adversaries; they saw them attempting to mislead the people, and to precipitate their divisions, by the sound of names, and forced to do it, the opposers, in general terms, alledged those names were not of sufficient authority to justify the hasty adoption of the system contended for. The convention, as a body, was undoubtedly respectable; it was, generally, composed of members of the then and preceding Congresses: as a body of respectable men we ought to view it. To select individual names, is an invitation to personal attacks, and the advocates, for their own sake, ought to have known the abilities, politics, and situation of some of their favourite characters better, before they held them up to view in the manner they did, as men entitled to our implicit political belief: they ought to have known, whether all the men they so held up to view could, for their past conduct in public offices, be approved or not by the public records, and the honest part of the community. These ardent advocates seem now to be peevish and angry, because, by their own folly, they have led to an investigation of facts and of political characters, unfavourable to them, which they had not the discernment to foresee. They may well apprehend they have opened a door to some Junius,2 or to some man, after his manner, with his polite addresses to men by name, to state serious facts, and unfold the truth; but these advocates may rest assured, that cool men in the opposition, best acquainted with the affairs of the country, will not, in the critical passage of a people from one constitution to another, pursue inquiries, which, in other circumstances, will be deserving of the highest praise. I will say nothing further about political characters, but examine the constitution; and as a necessary and previous measure to a particular examination, I shall state a few general positions and principles, which receive a general assent, and briefly notice the leading features of the confederation, and several state conventions [i.e., constitutions], to which, through the whole investigation, we must frequently have recourse, to aid the mind in its determinations. We can put but little dependance on the partial and vague information transmitted to us respecting antient governments; our situation as a people is peculiar: our people in general have a high sense of freedom; they are high spirited, though capable of deliberate measures; they are intelligent, discerning, and well informed; and it is to their condition we must mould the constitution and laws. We have no royal or noble families, and all things concur in favour of a government entirely elective. We have tried our abilities as freemen in a most arduous contest, and have succeeded; but we now find the main spring [983]of our movements were the love of liberty, and a temporary ardor, and not any energetic principle in the federal system. Our territories are far too extensive for a limited monarchy, in which the representatives must frequently assemble, and the laws operate mildly and systematically. The most elligible system is a federal republic, that is, a system in which national concerns may be transacted in the centre, and local affairs in state or district governments. The powers of the union ought to be extended to commerce, the coin, and national objects; and a division of powers, and a deposit of them in different hands, is safest. Good government is generally the result of experience and gradual improvements, and a punctual execution of the laws is essential to the preservation of life, liberty, and property. Taxes are always necessary, and the power to raise them can never be safely lodged without checks and limitation, but in a full and substantial representation of the body of the people; the quantity of power delegated ought to be compensated by the brevity of the time of holding it, in order to prevent the possessors increasing it. The supreme power is in the people, and rulers possess only that portion which is expressly given them; yet the wisest people have often declared this is the case on proper occasions, and have carefully formed stipulations to fix the extent, and limit the exercise of the power given. The people by Magna Charta, &c. did not acquire powers, or receive privileges from the king, they only ascertained and fixed those they were entitled to as Englishmen; the title used by the king “we grant,” was mere form. Representation, and the jury trial, are the best features of a free government ever as yet discovered, and the only means by which the body of the people can have their proper influence in the affairs of government. In a federal system we must not only balance the parts of the same government, as that of the state, or that of the union; but we must find a balancing influence between the general and local governments—the latter is what men or writers have but very little or imperfectly considered. A free and mild government is that in which no laws can be made without the formal and free consent of the people, or of their constitutional representatives; that is, of a substantial representative branch. Liberty, in its genuine sense, is security to enjoy the effects of our honest industry and labours, in a free and mild government, and personal security from all illegal restraints. Of rights, some are natural and unalienable, of which even the people cannot deprive individuals: Some are constitutional or fundamental; these cannot be altered or abolished by the ordinary laws; but the [984]people, by express acts, may alter or abolish them—These, such as the trial by jury, the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, &c. individuals claim under the solemn compacts of the people, as constitutions, or at least under laws so strengthened by long usuage as not to be repealable by the ordinary legislature—and some are common or mere legal rights, that is, such as individuals claim under laws which the ordinary legislature may alter or abolish at pleasure. The confederation is a league of friendship among the states or sovereignties for the common defence and mutual welfare—Each state expressly retains its sovereignty, and all powers not expressly given to congress—All federal powers are lodged in a congress of delegates annually elected by the state legislatures, except in Connecticut and Rhode-Island, where they are chosen by the people—Each state has a vote in congress, pays its delegates, and may instruct or recall them; no delegate can hold any office of profit, or serve more than three years in any six years—Each state may be represented by not less than two, or more than seven delegates.3 Congress (nine states agreeing) may make peace and war, treaties and alliances, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, regulate the alloy and value of the coin, require men and monies of the states by fixed proportions, and appropriate monies, form armies and navies, emit bills of credit, and borrow monies. Congress (seven states agreeing) may send and receive ambassadors, regulate captures, make rules for governing the army and navy, institute courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and for settling territorial disputes between the individual states, regulate weight and measures, post offices, and Indian affairs. No state, without the consent of congress, can send or receive embassies, make any agreement with any other state, or a foreign state, keep up any vessels of war or bodies of forces in time of peace, or engage in war, or lay any duties which may interfere with the treaties of congress—Each state must appoint regimental officers, and keep up a well regulated militia—Each state may prohibit the importation or exportation of any species of goods. The free inhabitants of one state are intitled to the privileges and immunities of the free citizens of the other states—Credit in each state shall be given to the records and judicial proceedings in the others. Canada, acceding, may be admitted, and any other colony may be admitted by the consent of nine states. Alterations may be made by the agreement of congress, and confirmation of all the state legislatures. The following, I think, will be allowed to be unalienable or fundamental rights in the United States:— No man, demeaning himself peaceably, shall be molested on account of his religion or mode of worship—The people have a right to hold and enjoy their property according to known standing laws, and which cannot be taken from them without their consent, or the consent of their representatives; and whenever taken in the pressing urgencies of government, they are to receive a reasonable compensation for it—Individual security consists in having free recourse to the laws—The people are subject to no laws or taxes not assented to by their representatives constitutionally assembled—They are at all times intitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, the trial by jury in criminal and civil causes—They have a right, when charged, to a speedy trial in the vicinage; to be heard by themselves or counsel, not to be compelled to furnish evidence against themselves, to have witnesses face to face, and to confront their adversaries before the judge—No man is held to answer a crime charged upon him till it be substantially described to him; and he is subject to no unreasonable searches or seizures of his person, papers or effects—The people have a right to assemble in an orderly manner, and petition the government for a redress of wrongs—The freedom of the press ought not to be restrained—No emoluments, except for actual service—No hereditary honors, or orders of nobility, ought to be allowed—The military ought to be subordinate to the civil authority, and no soldier be quartered on the citizens without their consent—The militia ought always to be armed and disciplined, and the usual defence of the country—The supreme power is in the people, and power delegated ought to return to them at stated periods, and frequently—The legislative, executive, and judicial powers, ought always to be kept distinct—others perhaps might be added. The organization of the state governments—Each state has a legislature, an executive, and a judicial branch—In general legislators are excluded from the important executive and judicial offices—Except in the Carolinas there is no constitutional distinction among Christian sects—The constitutions of New York, Delaware, and Virginia, exclude the clergy from offices civil and military—the other states do nearly the same in practice. Each state has a democratic branch elected twice a-year in Rhode-Island and Connecticut, biennially in South-Carolina, and annually in the other states—There are about 1500 representatives in all the states, or one to each 1700 inhabitants, reckoning five blacks for three whites—The states do not differ as to the age or moral characters of the electors or elected, nor materially as to their property. Pennsylvania has lodged all her legislative powers in a single branch, and Georgia has done the same; the other eleven states have each in their legislatures a second or senatorial branch. In forming this they [986]have combined various principles, and aimed at several checks and balances. It is amazing to see how ingenuity has worked in the several states to fix a barrier against popular instability. In Massachusetts the senators are apportioned on districts according to the taxes they pay, nearly according to property. In Connecticut the freemen, in September, vote for twenty counsellers, and return the names of those voted for in the several towns; the legislature takes the twenty who have the most votes, and gives them to the people, who, in April, chuse twelve of them, who, with the governor and deputy governor, form the senatorial branch. In Maryland the senators are chosen by two electors from each county; these electors are chosen by the freemen, and qualified as the members in the democratic branch are: In these two cases checks are aimed at in the mode of election. Several states have taken into view the periods of service, age, property, &c. In South-Carolina a senator is elected for two years, in Delaware three, and in New-York and Virginia four, in Maryland five, and in the other states for one. In New-York and Virginia one-fourth part go out yearly. In Virginia a senator must be twenty-five years old, in South-Carolina thirty. In New-York the electors must each have a freehold worth 250 dollars, in North-Carolina a freehold of fifty acres of land; in the other states the electors of senators are qualified as electors of representatives are. In Massachusetts a senator must have a freehold in his own right worth 1000 dollars, or any estate worth 2000, in New-Jersey any estate worth 2666, in South-Carolina worth 1300 dollars, in North-Carolina 300 acres of land in fee, &c. The numbers of senators in each state are from ten to thirty-one, about 160 in the eleven states, about one to 14000 inhabitants. Two states, Massachusetts and New-York, have each introduced into their legislatures a third, but incomplete branch. In the former, the governor may negative any law not supported by two-thirds of the senators, and two-thirds of the representatives: in the latter, the governor, chancellor, and judges of the supreme court may do the same. Each state has a single executive branch. In the five eastern states the people at large elect their governors; in the other states the legislatures elect them. In South Carolina the governor is elected once in two years; in New-York and Delaware once in three, and in the other states annually. The governor of New-York has no executive council, the other governors have. In several states the governor has a vote in the senatorial branch—the governors have similar powers in some instances, and quite dissimilar ones in others. The number of executive counsellers in the states are from five to twelve. In the four eastern states, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, they are of the men returned legislators by the people. In Pennsylvania the counsellers are [987]chosen triennially, in Delaware every fourth year, in Virginia every three years, in South-Carolina biennially, and in the other states yearly. Each state has a judicial branch; each common law courts, superior and inferior; some chancery and admiralty courts: The courts in general sit in different places, in order to accommodate the citizens. The trial by jury is had in all the common law courts, and in some of the admiralty courts. The democratic freemen principally form the juries; men destitute of property, of character, or under age, are excluded as in elections. Some of the judges are during good behaviour, and some appointed for a year, and some for years; and all are dependant on the legislatures for their salaries—Particulars respecting this department are too many to be noticed here. LETTER VII. December 31, 1787. Dear Sir, In viewing the various governments instituted by mankind, we see their whole force reducible to two principles—the important springs which alone move the machines, and give them their intended influence and controul, are force and persuasion: by the former men are compelled, by the latter they are drawn. We denominate a government despotic or free, as the one or other principle prevails in it. Perhaps it is not possible for a government to be so despotic, as not to operate persuasively on some of its subjects; nor is it, in the nature of things, I conceive, for a government to be so free, or so supported by voluntary consent, as never to want force to compel obedience to the laws. In despotic governments one man, or a few men, independant of the people, generally make the laws, command obedience, and inforce it by the sword: one-fourth part of the people are armed, and obliged to endure the fatigues of soldiers, to oppress the others and keep them subject to the laws. In free governments the people, or their representatives, make the laws; their execution is principally the effect of voluntary consent and aid; the people respect the magistrate, follow their private pursuits, and enjoy the fruits of their labour with very small deductions for the public use. The body of the people must evidently prefer the latter species of government; and it can be only those few, who may be well paid for the part they take in enforcing despotism, that can, for a moment, prefer the former. Our true object is to give full efficacy to one principle, to arm persuasion on every side, and to render force as little necessary as possible. Persuasion is never dangerous not even in despotic governments; but military force, if often applied internally, can never fail to destroy the love and confidence, and break the spirits, of the people; and to render it totally impracticable [988]and unnatural for him or them who govern, and yield to this force against the people, to hold their places by the peoples’ elections. I repeat my observation, that the plan proposed will have a doubtful operation between the two principles; and whether it will preponderate towards persuasion or force is uncertain. Government must exist—If the persuasive principle be feeble, force is infallibly the next resort—The moment the laws of congress shall be disregarded they must languish, and the whole system be convulsed—that moment we must have recourse to this next resort, and all freedom vanish. It being impracticable for the people to assemble to make laws, they must elect legislators, and assign men to the different departments of the government. In the representative branch we must expect chiefly to collect the confidence of the people, and in it to find almost entirely the force of persuasion. In forming this branch, therefore, several important considerations must be attended to. It must possess abilities to discern the situation of the people and of public affairs, a disposition to sympathize with the people, and a capacity and inclination to make laws congenial to their circumstances and condition: it must afford security against interested combinations, corruption and influence; it must possess the confidence, and have the voluntary support of the people. I think these positions will not be controverted, nor the one I formerly advanced, that a fair and equal representation is that in which the interests, feelings, opinions and views of the people are collected, in such manner as they would be were the people all assembled.4 Having made these general observations, I shall proceed to consider further my principal position, viz. that there is no substantial representation of the people provided for in a government, in which the most essential powers, even as to the internal police of the country, are proposed to be lodged; and to propose certain amendments as to the representative branch: 1st, That there ought to be an increase of the numbers of representatives: And, 2dly, That the elections of them ought to be better secured.5 1. The representation is unsubstantial and ought to be increased. In matters where there is much room for opinion, you will not expect me to establish my positions with mathematical certainty; you must only expect my observations to be candid, and such as are well founded in the mind of the writer. I am in a field where doctors disagree; and as to genuine representation, though no feature in government can be more important, perhaps, no one has been less understood, and no one that has received so imperfect a consideration by political writers. [989]The ephori in Sparta, and the tribunes in Rome,6 were but the shadow; the representation in Great-Britain is unequal and insecure. In America we have done more in establishing this important branch on its true principles, than, perhaps, all the world besides: yet even here, I conceive, that very great improvements in representation may be made. In fixing this branch, the situation of the people must be surveyed, and the number of representatives and forms of election apportioned to that situation. When we find a numerous people settled in a fertile and extensive country, possessing equality, and few or none of them oppressed with riches or wants, it ought to be the anxious care of the constitution and laws, to arrest them from national depravity, and to preserve them in their happy condition. A virtuous people make just laws, and good laws tend to preserve unchanged a virtuous people. A virtuous and happy people by laws uncongenial to their characters, may easily be gradually changed into servile and depraved creatures. Where the people, or their representatives, make the laws, it is probable they will generally be fitted to the national character and circumstances, unless the representation be partial, and the imperfect substitute of the people. However, the people may be electors, if the representation be so formed as to give one or more of the natural classes of men in the society an undue ascendency over the others, it is imperfect; the former will gradually become masters, and the latter slaves. It is the first of all among the political balances, to preserve in its proper station each of these classes. We talk of balances in the legislature, and among the departments of government; we ought to carry them to the body of the people. Since I advanced the idea of balancing the several orders of men in a community, in forming a genuine representation,7 and seen that idea considered as chemerical, I have been sensibly struck with a sentence in the marquis Beccaria’s treatise: this sentence was quoted by congress in 1774, and is as follows:—“In every society there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the others to the extreme of weakness and misery; the intent of good laws is to oppose this effort, and to diffuse their influence universally and equally.”8 Add to this Montesquieu’s opinion, that “in a free state every man, who is supposed to be a free agent, ought to be concerned in his own government: therefore, the legislative should reside in the whole body of the people, or their representatives.”9 It is extremely clear that these writers had in view the several orders of men in society, which we call aristocratical, democratical, merchantile, mechanic, &c. and perceived the efforts they are constantly, from interested and ambitious views, disposed to make to elevate themselves and oppress others. Each order must have a share in [990]the business of legislation actually and efficiently. It is deceiving a people to tell them they are electors, and can chuse their legislators, if they cannot, in the nature of things, chuse men from among themselves, and genuinely like themselves. I wish you to take another idea along with you; we are not only to balance these natural efforts, but we are also to guard against accidental combinations; combinations founded in the connections of offices and private interests, both evils which are increased in proportion as the number of men, among which the elected must be, are decreased. To set this matter in a proper point of view, we must form some general ideas and descriptions of the different classes of men, as they may be divided by occupations and politically: the first class is the aristocratical. There are three kinds of aristocracy spoken of in this country—the first is a constitutional one, which does not exist in the United States in our common acceptation of the word. Montesquieu, it is true, observes, that where a part of the persons in a society, for want of property, age, or moral character, are excluded any share in the government, the others, who alone are the constitutional electors and elected, form this aristocracy;10 this according to him, exists in each of the United States, where a considerable number of persons, as all convicted of crimes, under age, or not possessed of certain property, are excluded any share in the government; the second is an aristocratic faction, a junto of unprincipled men, often distinguished for their wealth or abilities, who combine together and make their object their private interests and aggrandizement; the existence of this description is merely accidental, but particularly to be guarded against. The third is the natural aristocracy; this term we use to designate a respectable order of men, the line between whom and the natural democracy is in some degree arbitrary; we may place men on one side of this line, which others may place on the other, and in all disputes between the few and the many, a considerable number are wavering and uncertain themselves on which side they are, or ought to be. In my idea of our natural aristocracy in the United States, I include about four or five thousand men; and among these I reckon those who have been placed in the offices of governors, of members of Congress, and state senators generally, in the principal officers of Congress, of the army and militia, the superior judges, the most eminent professional men, &c. and men of large property11—the other persons and orders in the community form the natural democracy; this includes in general the yeomanry, the subordinate officers, civil and military, the fishermen, mechanics and traders, many of the merchants and professional men. It is easy to perceive that men of these two classes, the aristocratical, and democratical, with views equally honest, have sentiments [991]widely different, especially respecting public and private expences, salaries, taxes, &c. Men of the first class associate more extensively, have a high sense of honor, possess abilities, ambition, and general knowledge: men of the second class are not so much used to combining great objects; they possess less ambition, and a larger share of honesty: their dependence is principally on middling and small estates, industrious pursuits, and hard labour, while that of the former is principally on the emoluments of large estates, and of the chief offices of government. Not only the efforts of these two great parties are to be balanced, but other interests and parties also, which do not always oppress each other merely for want of power, and for fear of the consequences; though they, in fact, mutually depend on each other; yet such are their general views, that the merchants alone would never fail to make laws favourable to themselves and oppressive to the farmers, &c. the farmers alone would act on like principles; the former would tax the land, the latter the trade. The manufacturers are often disposed to contend for monopolies, buyers make every exertion to lower prices, and sellers to raise them; men who live by fees and salaries endeavour to raise them, and the part of the people who pay them, endeavour to lower them; the public creditors to augment the taxes, and the people at large to lessen them. Thus, in every period of society, and in all the transactions of men, we see parties verifying the observation made by the Marquis; and those classes which have not their centinels in the government, in proportion to what they have to gain or lose, must infallibly be ruined. Efforts among parties are not merely confined to property; they contend for rank and distinctions; all their passions in turn are enlisted in political controversies—Men, elevated in society, are often disgusted with the changeableness of the democracy, and the latter are often agitated with the passions of jealousy and envy: the yeomanry possess a large share of property and strength, are nervous and firm in their opinions and habits—the mechanics of towns are ardent and changeable, honest and credulous, they are inconsiderable for numbers, weight and strength, not always sufficiently stable for the supporting free governments; the fishing interest partakes partly of the strength and stability of the landed, and partly of the changeableness of the mechanic interest. As to merchants and traders, they are our agents in almost all money transactions; give activity to government, and possess a considerable share of influence in it. It has been observed by an able writer, that frugal industrious merchants are generally advocates for liberty. It is an observation, I believe, well founded, that the schools produce but few advocates for republican forms of government; gentlemen of the law, divinity, physic, &c. probably form about a fourth [992]part of the people; yet their political influence, perhaps, is equal to that of all the other descriptions of men; if we may judge from the appointments to Congress, the legal characters will often, in a small representation, be the majority; but the more the representatives are encreased, the more of the farmers, merchants, &c. will be found to be brought into the government. These general observations will enable you to discern what I intend by different classes, and the general scope of my ideas, when I contend for uniting and balancing their interests, feelings, opinions, and views in the legislature; we may not only so unite and balance these as to prevent a change in the government by the gradual exaltation of one part to the depression of others, but we may derive many other advantages from the combination and full representation; a small representation can never be well informed as to the circumstances of the people, the members of it must be too far removed from the people, in general, to sympathize with them, and too few to communicate with them: a representation must be extremely imperfect where the representatives are not circumstanced to make the proper communications to their constituents, and where the constituents in turn cannot, with tolerable convenience, make known their wants, circumstances, and opinions, to their representatives; where there is but one representative to 30,000, or 40,000 inhabitants, it appears to me, he can only mix, and be acquainted with a few respectable characters among his constituents, even double the federal representation, and then there must be a very great distance between the representatives and the people in general represented. On the proposed plan, the state of Delaware, the city of Philadelphia, the state of Rhode Island, the province of Main[e], the county of Suffolk in Massachusetts, will have one representative each; there can be but little personal knowledge, or but few communications, between him and the people at large of either of those districts. It has been observed, that mixing only with the respectable men, he will get the best information and ideas from them; he will also receive impressions favourable to their purposes particularly. Many plausible shifts have been made to divert the mind from dwelling on this defective representation, these I shall consider in another place.12 Could we get over all our difficulties respecting a balance of interests and party efforts, to raise some and oppress others, the want of sympathy, information and intercourse between the representatives and the people, an insuperable difficulty will still remain, I mean the constant liability of a small number of representatives to private combinations; the tyranny of the one, or the licentiousness of the multitude, are, in my mind, but small evils, compared with the factions of the few. It is a [993]consideration well worth pursuing, how far this house of representatives will be liable to be formed into private juntos, how far influenced by expectations of appointments and offices, how far liable to be managed by the president and senate, and how far the people will have confidence in them. To obviate difficulties on this head, as well as objections to the representative branch, generally, several observations have been made—these I will now examine, and if they shall appear to be unfounded, the objections must stand unanswered. That the people are the electors, must elect good men, and attend to the administration. It is said that the members of Congress, at stated periods, must return home, and that they must be subject to the laws they may make, and to a share of the burdens they may impose. That the people possess the strong arm to overawe their rulers, and the best checks in their national character against the abuses of power, that the supreme power will remain in them. That the state governments will form a part of, and a balance in the system. That Congress will have only a few national objects to attend to, and the state governments many and local ones. That the new Congress will be more numerous than the present, and that any numerous body is unwieldy and mobbish. That the states only are represented in the present Congress, and that the people will require a representation in the new one; that in fifty or an hundred years the representation will be numerous. That congress will have no temptation to do wrong; and that no system to enslave the people is practicable. That as long as the people are free they will preserve free governments; and that when they shall become tired of freedom, arbitrary government must take place. These observations I shall examine in the course of my letters; and, I think, not only shew that they are not well founded, but point out the fallacy of some of them; and shew, that others do not very well comport with the dignified and manly sentiments of a free and enlightened people. LETTER VIII. January 3, 1788. Dear Sir, Before I proceed to examine the objections, I beg leave to add a valuable idea respecting representation, to be collected from De Lome,13 and other able writers, which essentially tends to confirm my positions: They very justly impute the establishment of general and [994]equal liberty in England to a balance of interests and powers among the different orders of men; aided by a series of fortunate events, that never before, and possibly never again will happen. Before the Norman conquest the people of England enjoyed much of this liberty. The first of the Norman kings, aided by foreign mercenaries and foreign attendants, obnoxious to the English, immediately laid arbitrary taxes, and established arbitrary courts, and severely oppress[ed] all orders of people: The barons and people, who recollected their former liberties, were induced, by those oppressions, to unite their efforts in their common defence: Here it became necessary for the great men, instead of deceiving and depressing the people, to enlighten and court them; the royal power was too strongly fixed to be annihilated, and rational means were, therefore directed to limiting it within proper bounds. In this long and arduous task, in this new species of contests, the barons and people succeeded, because they had been freemen, and knew the value of the object they were contending for; because they were the people of a small island—one people who found it practicable to meet and deliberate in one assembly, and act under one system of resolves, and who were not obliged to meet in different provincial assemblies, as is the case in large countries, as was the case in France, Spain, &c. where their determinations were inconsistent with each other, and where the king could play off one assembly against another. It was in this united situation the people of England were for several centuries, enabled to combine their exertions, and by compacts, as Magna Charta, a bill of rights, &c. were able to limit, by degrees, the royal prerogatives, and establish their own liberties. The first combination was, probably, the accidental effect of pre-existing circumstances; but there was an admirable balance of interests in it, which has been the parent of English liberty, and excellent regulations enjoyed since that time. The executive power having been uniformly in the king, and he the visible head of the nation, it was chimerical for the greatest lord or most popular leader, consistent with the state of the government, and opinion of the people, to seriously think of becoming the king’s rival, or to aim at even a share of the executive power; the greatest subject’s prospect was only in acquiring a respectable influence in the house of commons, house of lords, or in the ministry; circumstances at once made it the interests of the leaders of the people to stand by them. Far otherwise was it with the ephori in Sparta, and tribunes in Rome. The leaders in England have led the people to freedom, in almost all other countries to servitude. The people in England have made use of deliberate exertions, their safest and [995]most efficient weapons. In other countries they have often acted like mobs, and been enslaved by their enemies, or by their own leaders In England, the people have been led uniformly, and systematically by their representatives to secure their rights by compact, and to abolish innovations upon the government: they successively obtained Magna Charta, the powers of taxation, the power to propose laws, the habeas corpus act, bill of rights, &c. they, in short, secured general and equal liberty, security to their persons and property; and, as an everlasting security and bulwark of their liberties, they fixed the democratic branch in the legislature, and jury trial in the execution of the laws, the freedom of the press, &c. In Rome, and most other countries, the reverse of all this is true. In Greece, Rome, and wherever the civil law has been adopted, torture has been admitted. In Rome the people were subject to arbitrary confiscations, and even their lives would be arbitrarily disposed of by consuls, tribunes, dictators, masters, &c. half of the inhabitants were slaves, and the other half never knew what equal liberty was; yet in England the people have had king, lords, and commons; in Rome they had consuls, senators and tribunes: why then was the government of England so mild and favourable to the body of the people, and that of Rome an ambitious and oppressive aristocracy? Why in England have the revolutions always ended in stipulations in favour of general liberty, equal laws, and the common rights of the people, and in most other countries in favour only of a few influential men? The reasons, in my mind, are obvious: In England the people have been substantially represented in many respects; in the other countries it has not been so. Perhaps a small degree of attention to a few simple facts will illustrate this.—In England, from the oppressions of the Norman kings to the revolution in 1688, during which period of two or three hundred years, the English liberties were ascertained and established, the aristocratic part of that nation was substantially represented by a very large number of nobles, possessing similar interests and feelings with those they represented. The body of the people, about four or five millions, then mostly a frugal landed people, were represented by about five hundred representatives, taken not from the order of men which formed the aristocracy, but from the body of the people, and possessed of the same interests and feelings. De Lome, speaking of the British representation, expressly founds all his reasons on this union; this similitude of interests, feelings, views and circumstances. He observes, the English have preserved their liberties, because they and their leaders or representatives have been strictly united in interests, and in contending for general liberty.14 Here we see a genuine balance founded in the actual state [996]of things. The whole community, probably, not more than two-fifths more numerous than we now are, were represented by seven or eight hundred men; the barons stipulated with the common people, and the king with the whole. Had the legal distinction between lords and commons been broken down, and the people of that island been called upon to elect forty-five senators, and one hundred and twenty representatives, about the proportion we propose to establish, their whole legislature evidently would have been of the natural aristocracy, and the body of the people would not have had scarcely a single sincere advocate; their interests would have been neglected, general and equal liberty forgot, and the balance lost; contests and conciliations, as in most other countries, would have been merely among the few, and as it might have been necessary to serve their purposes, the people at large would have been flattered or threatened, and probably not a single stipulation made in their favour. In Rome the people were miserable, though they had three orders, the consuls, senators and tribunes, and approved the laws, and all for want of a genuine representation. The people were too numerous to assemble, and do any thing properly themselves; the voice of a few, the dupes of artifice, was called the voice of the people. It is difficult for the people to defend themselves against the arts and intrigues of the great, but by selecting a suitable number of men fixed to their interests to represent them, and to oppose ministers and senators. And the people’s all depends on the number of the men selected, and the manner of doing it. To be convinced of this, we need only attend to the reason of the case, the conduct of the British commons, and of the Roman tribunes: equal liberty prevails in England, because there was a representation of the people, in fact and reality, to establish it; equal liberty never prevailed in Rome, because there was but the shadow of a representation. There were consuls in Rome annually elected to execute the laws, several hundred senators represented the great families; the body of the people annually chose tribunes from among themselves to defend them and to secure their rights; I think the number of tribunes annually chosen never exceeded ten. This representation, perhaps, was not proportionally so numerous as the representation proposed in the new plan; but the difference will not appear to be so great, when it shall be recollected, that these tribunes were chosen annually; that the great patrician families were not admitted to these offices of tribunes, and that the people of Italy who elected the tribunes were a long while, if not always, a small people compared with the people of the United States. What was the consequence of this triffling representation? The people of Rome always elected for their tribunes men conspicuous for [997]their riches, military commands, professional popularity, &c. great commoners, between whom and the noble families there was only the shadowy difference of legal distinction. Among all the tribunes the people chose for several centuries, they had scarcely five real friends to their interests. These tribunes lived, felt and saw, not like the people, but like the great patrician families, like senators and great officers of state, to get into which it was evident, by their conduct, was their sole object. These tribunes often talked about the rights and prerogatives of the people, and that was all; for they never even attempted to establish equal liberty: so far from establishing the rights of the people, they suffered the senate, to the exclusion of the people, to engross the powers of taxation; those excellent and almost only real weapons of defence even the people of England possess. The tribunes obtained that the people should be eligible to some of the great offices of state, and marry, if they pleased, into the noble families; these were advantages in their nature, confined to a few elevated commoners, and of triffling importance to the people at large. Nearly the same observations may be made as to the ephori of Sparta. We may amuse ourselves with names; but the fact is, men will be governed by the motives and temptations that surround their situation. Political evils to be guarded against are in the human character, and not in the name of patrician or plebian. Had the people of Italy, in the early period of the republic, selected yearly, or biennially, four or five hundred of their best informed men, emphatically from among themselves, these representatives would have formed an honest respectable assembly, capable of combining in them the views and exertions of the people, and their respectability would have procured them honest and able leaders, and we should have seen equal liberty established. True liberty stands in need of a fostering hand; from the days of Adam she has found but one temple to dwell in securely; she has laid the foundation of one, perhaps her last, in America; whether this is to be compleated and have duration, is yet a question. Equal liberty never yet found many advocates among the great: it is a disagreeable truth, that power perverts mens views in a greater degree, than public employments inform their understandings—they become hardened in certain maxims, and more lost to fellow feelings. Men may always be too cautious to commit alarming and glaring iniquities: but they, as well as systems, are liable to be corrupted by slow degrees. Junius well observes, we are not only to guard against what men will do, but even against what they may do.15 Men in high public offices are in stations where they gradually lose sight of the people, and do not often think of attending to them, except when necessary to answer private purposes. [998 The body of the people must have this true representative security placed some where in the nation; and in the United States, or in any extended empire, I am fully persuaded can be placed no where, but in the forms of a federal republic, where we can divide and place it in several state or district legislatures, giving the people in these the means of opposing heavy internal taxes and oppressive measures in the proper stages. A great empire contains the amities and animosities of a world within itself. We are not like the people of England, one people compactly settled on a small island, with a great city filled with frugal merchants, serving as a common centre of liberty and union: we are dispersed, and it is impracticable for any but the few to assemble in one place: the few must be watched, checked, and often resisted—tyranny has ever shewn a prediliction to be in close amity with them, or the one man. Drive it from kings and it flies to senators, to dicemvirs, to dictators, to tribunes, to popular leaders, to military chiefs, &c. De Lome well observes, that in societies, laws which were to be equal to all are soon warped to the private interests of the administrators, and made to defend the usurpations of a few.16 The English, who had tasted the sweets of equal laws, were aware of this, and though they restored their king, they carefully delegated to parliament the advocates of freedom. I have often lately heard it observed, that it will do very well for a people to make a constitution, and ordain, that at stated periods they will chuse, in a certain manner, a first magistrate, a given number of senators and representatives, and let them have all power to do as they please. This doctrine, however it may do for a small republic, as Connecticut, for instance, where the people may chuse so many senators and representatives to assemble in the legislature, in an eminent degree, the interests, the views, feelings, and genuine sentiments of the people themselves, can never be admitted in an extensive country; and when this power is lodged in the hands of a few, not to limit the few, is but one step short of giving absolute power to one man—in a numerous representation the abuse of power is a common injury, and has no temptation—among the few, the abuse of power may often operate to the private emolument of those who abuse it. LETTER IX. January 4, 1788. Dear Sir, The advocates of the constitution say we must trust to the administration, and elect good men for representatives. I admit, that in forming the social compact, we can fix only general principles, and, of necessity, must trust something to the wisdom and integrity of the [999]administration. But the question is, do we not trust too much, and to men also placed in the vortex of temptation, to lay hold of proffered advantages for themselves and their connections, and to oppress the body of the people. It is one thing to authorise a well organized legislature to make laws, under the restraints of a well guarded constitution, and another to assemble a few men, and to tell them to do what they please. I am not the more shaken in my principles, or disposed to despair of the cause of liberty, because some of our able men have adopted the yielding language of non-resistance, and writers dare insult the people with the signatures of Caesar, Mark Antony, and of other tyrants; because I see even moderate and amiable men, forced to let go of monarchy in 1775, still in love with it, to use the simile of our countrymen, when the political pot boils, the skum will often get uppermost and make its appearance. I believe the people of America, when they shall fully understand any political subject brought before them, will talk in a very different stile, and use the manly language of freedom. But “the people must elect good men:”—Examine the system, Is it practicable for them to elect fit and proper representatives where the number is so small? “But the people may chuse whom they please.” This is an observation, I believe, made without due attention to facts and the state of the community. To explain my meaning, I will consider the descriptions of men commonly presented to the people as candidates for the offices of representatives—we may rank them in three classes. 1. The men who form the natural aristocracy, as before defined. 2. Popular demagogues: these men also are often politically elevated, so as to be seen by the people through the extent of large districts; they often have some abilities, without principle, and rise into notice by their noise and arts. 3. The substantial and respectable part of the democracy; they are a numerous and valuable set of men, who discern and judge well, but from being generally silent in public assemblies are often overlooked; they are the most substantial and best informed men in the several towns, who occasionally fill the middle grades of offices, &c. who hold not a splendid, but a respectable rank in private concerns: these men are extensively diffused through all the counties, towns, and small districts in the union; even they, and their immediate connections, are raised above the majority of the people, and as representatives are only brought to a level with a more numerous part of the community, the middle orders, and a degree nearer the mass of the people. Hence it is, that the best practical representation, even in a small state, must be several degrees more aristocratical than the body of the people. A representation so formed as to admit but few or none [1000]of the third class, is, in my opinion, not deserving of the name—even in armies, courts-martial are so formed as to admit subaltern officers into them. The true idea is, so to open and enlarge the representation as to let in a due proportion of the third class with those of the first. Now, my opinion is, that the representation proposed is so small, as that ordinarily very few or none of them can be elected; and, therefore, after all the parade of words and forms, the government must possess the soul of aristocracy, or something worse, the spirit of popular leaders. I observed in a former letter, that the state of Delaware, of Rhode-Island, the Province of Main[e], and each of the great counties in Massachusetts, &c. would have one member,17 and rather more than one when the representatives shall be increased to one for each 30,000 inhabitants. In some districts the people are more dispersed and unequal than in others: In Delaware they are compact, in the Province of Main dispersed; how can the elections in either of those districts be regulated so as that a man of the third class can be elected?—Exactly the same principles and motives, the same uncontroulable circumstances, must govern the elections as in the choice of the governors. Call upon the people of either of those districts to chuse a governor, and it will, probably, never happen that they will not bestow a major part, or the greatest number, of their votes on some very conspicuous or very popular character. A man that is known among a few thousands of people, may be quite unknown among thirty or forty thousand. On the whole, it appears to me to be almost a self-evident position, that when we call on thirty or forty thousand inhabitants to unite in giving their votes for one man, it will be uniformly impracticable for them to unite in any men, except those few who have become eminent for their civil or military rank, or their popular legal abilities: it will be found totally impracticable for men in the private walks of life, except in the profession of the law, to become conspicuous enough to attract the notice of so many electors and have their suffrages. But if I am right, it is asked why so many respectable men advocate the adoption of the proposed system. Several reasons may be given—many of our gentlemen are attached to the principles of monarchy and aristocracy; they have an aversion to democratic republics. The body of the people have acquired large powers and substantial influence by the revolution. In the unsettled state of things, their numerous representatives, in some instances, misused their powers, and have induced many good men suddenly to adopt ideas unfavourable to such republics, and which ideas they will discard on reflection. Without scrutinizing into the particulars of the proposed system, we immediately perceive that its general tendency is to collect the powers of government, [1001]now in the body of the people in reality, and to place them in the higher orders and fewer hands; no wonder then that all those of and about these orders are attached to it: they feel there is something in this system advantageous to them. On the other hand, the body of the people evidently feel there is something wrong and disadvantageous to them; both descriptions perceive there is something tending to bestow on the former the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the latter to weakness, insignificance, and misery. The people evidently feel all this though they want expressions to convey their ideas. Further, even the respectable part of the democracy, have never yet been able to distinguish clearly where the fallacy lies; they find there are defects in the confederation; they see a system presented, they think something must be done, and, while their minds are in suspence, the zealous advocates force a reluctant consent. Nothing can be a stronger evidence of the nature of this system, than the general sense of the several orders in the community respecting its tendency; the parts taken generally by them proves my position, that notwithstanding the parade of words and forms, the government must possess the soul of aristocracy. Congress, heretofore, have asked for moderate additional powers, the cry was give them—be federal: but the proper distinction between the cases that produce this disposition, and the system proposed, has not been fairly made and seen in all its consequences. We have seen some of our state representations too numerous, and without examining a medium we run into the opposite extreme. It is true, the proper number of federal representatives, is matter of opinion in some degree; but there are extremes which we immediately perceive, and others which we clearly discover on examination. We should readily pronounce a representative branch of 15 members small in a federal government, having complete powers as to taxes, military matters, commerce, the coin, &c. &c. On the other hand, we should readily pronounce a federal representation as numerous as those of the several states, consisting of about 1500 representatives, unwieldly and totally improper. It is asked, has not the wisdom of the convention found the medium? perhaps not: The convention was divided on this point of numbers: at least some of its ablest members urged, that instead of 65 representatives there ought to be 130 in the first instance: They fixed one representative for each 40,000 inhabitants, and at the close of the work, the president suggested, that the representation appeared to be too small and without debate, it was put at, not exceeding one for each 30,000.18 I mention these facts to shew, that the convention went on no fixed data. In this extensive country it is difficult to get a representation sufficiently numerous: Necessity, I believe, will oblige us to sacrifice in some degree the true genuine principles of representation: But this [1002]sacrifice ought to be as little as possible: How far we ought to increase the representation I will not pretend to say; but that we ought to increase it very considerably, is clear—to double it at least, making full allowances for the state representations: and this we may evidently do, and approach accordingly towards safety and perfection, without encountering any inconveniences. It is with great difficulty the people can unite these different interests and views even tolerably, in the state senators, who are more than twice as numerous as the federal representatives, as proposed by the convention; even these senators are considered as so far removed from the people, that they are not allowed immediately to hold their purse strings. The principle objections made to the increase of the representation are, the expence and difficulty in getting the members to attend. The first cannot be important; the last, if founded, is against any federal government. As to the expence, I presume, the house of representatives will not be in sessions more than four months in the year. We find by experience, that about two-thirds of the members of representative assemblies usually attend; therefore, of the representation proposed by the convention, about forty-five members probably will attend, doubling their number, about 90 will probably attend: their pay, in one case, at four dollars a day each (which is putting it high enough) will amount to, yearly, 21,600 dollars; in the other case, 43,200 dollars difference 21,600 dollars;—reduce the state representatives from 1500 down to 1000, and thereby save the attendance of two-thirds of the 500, say three months in a year, at one dollar and a quarter a day each 37,125 dollars. Thus we may leave the state representations sufficient large, and yet save enough by the reduction nearly to support exceeding well the whole federal representation I propose. Surely we never can be so unwise as to sacrifice, essentially, the all-important principles of representation for so small a sum as 21,600 dollars a year for the United States; a single company of soldiers would cost this sum. It is a fact that can easily be shewn, that we expend three times this sum every year upon useless inferior offices and very triffling concerns. It is also a fact which can be shewn, that the United States in the late war suffered more by a faction in the federal government, than the pay of the federal representation will amount to for twenty years. As to the attendance—Can we be so unwise as to establish an unsafe and inadequate representative branch, and give it as a reason, that we believe only a few members will be induced to attend; we ought certainly to establish an adequate representative branch, and adopt measures to induce an attendance; I believe that a due proportion of 130 or 140 members may be induced to attend: there are various reasons [1003]for the non-attendance of the members of the present congress; it is to be presumed that these will not exist under the new system. To compensate for the want of a genuine representation in a government, where the purse and sword, and all important powers, are proposed to be lodged, a variety of unimportant things are enumerated by the advocates of it. In the second place, it is said the members of congress must return home, and share in the burdens they may impose; and, therefore, private motives will induce them to make mild laws, to support liberty, and ease the burdens of the people: this brings us to a mere question of interest under this head. I think these observations will appear, on examination, altogether fallacious; because this individual interest, which may coincide with the rights and interests of the people, will be far more than balanced by opposite motives and opposite interests. If, on a fair calculation, a man will gain more by measures oppressive to others than he will lose by them, he is interested in their adoption. It is true, that those who govern, generally, by increasing the public burdens increase their own share of them; but by this increase they may, and often do, increase their salaries, fees, and emoluments, in a tenfold proportion, by increasing salaries, forming armies and navies, and by making offices—If it shall appear the members of congress will have these temptations before them, the argument is on my side—they will view the account, and be induced continually to make efforts advantageous to themselves and connections, and oppressive to others. We must examine facts—Congress, in its present form, have but few offices to dispose of worth the attention of the members, or of men of the aristocracy; yet, from 1774 to this time, we find a large proportion of those offices assigned to those who were or had been members of congress, and though the states chuse annually sixty or seventy members, many of them have been provided for; but few men are known to congress in this extensive country, and, probably, but few will be to the president and senate, except those who have or shall appear as members of congress, or those whom the members may bring forward. The states may now chuse yearly ninety-one members of congress;19 under the new constitution they will have it in their power to chuse exactly the same number, perhaps afterwards, one hundred and fifteen, but these must be chosen once in two and six years; so that, in the course of ten years together, not more than two-thirds so many members of congress will be elected and brought into view, as there now are under the confederation in the same term of time: but at least there will be five, if not ten times, as many offices and places worthy the attention of the members, under the new constitution, as there are [1004]under the confederation: therefore, we may fairly presume, that a very great proportion of the members of congress, especially the influential ones, instead of returning to private life, will be provided for with lucrative offices, in the civil or military department, and not only the members, but many of their sons, friends, and connection. These offices will be in the constitutional disposition of the president and senate, and, corruption out of the question, what kind of security can we expect in a representation, so many of the members of which may rationally feel themselves candidates for these offices?—let common sense decide. It is true, that members chosen to offices must leave their seats in congress, and to some few offices they cannot be elected till the time shall be expired for which they were elected members; but this scarcely will effect the biass arising from the hopes and expectations of office. It is not only in this point of view, the members of congress, by their efforts, may make themselves and friends powerful and happy, while the people may be oppressed: but there is another way in which they may soon warp laws, which ought to be equal, to their own advantages, by those imperceptible means, and on those doubtful principles which may not alarm. No society can do without taxes; they are the efficient means of safety and defence, and they too have often been the weapons by which the blessings of society have been destroyed. Congress will have power to lay taxes at pleasure for the general welfare; and if they mis-judge of the general welfare, and lay unnecessary oppressive taxes, the constitution will provide, as I shall hereafter shew, no remedy for the people or states—the people must bear them, or have recourse, not to any constitutional checks or remedies, but to that resistence which is the last resort, and founded in self-defence.20 It is well stipulated, that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be equal; and that direct taxes shall be apportioned on the several states by a fixed rule, but nothing further. Here commences a dangerous power in matters of taxation, lodged without any regard to the balance of interests of the different orders of men, and without any regard to the internal policy of the states. Congress having assigned to any state its quota, say to New-Jersey, 80,000 dollars in a given tax, congress will be entirely at liberty to apportion that sum on the counties and towns, polls, lands, houses, labour, &c. and appoint the assessors and collectors in that state in what manner they please; there will be nothing to prevent a system of tax laws being made, unduly to ease some descriptions of men and burden others; though such a system may be unjust and injudicious, though we may complain, the answer will be, congress have [1005]the power delegated by the people, and, probably, congress has done what it thought best. By the confederation taxes must be quoted on the several states by fixed rules, as before mentioned: but then each state’s quota is apportioned on the several numbers and classes of citizens in the state by the state legislature, assessed and collected by state laws. Great pains have been taken to confound the two cases, which are as distinct as light and darkness; this I shall endeavour to illustrate, when I come to the amendment respecting internal taxes. I shall only observe, at present, that in the state legislatures the body of the people will be genuinely represented, and in congress not; that the right of resisting oppressive measures is inherent in the people, and that a constitutional barrier should be so formed, that their genuine representatives may stop an oppressive ruinous measure in its early progress, before it shall come to maturity, and the evils of it become in a degree fixed. It has lately been often observed, that the power or body of men intrusted with the national defence and tranquility, must necessarily possess the purse unlimitedly, that the purse and sword must go together—this is new doctrine in a free country, and by no means tenable. In the British government the king is particularly intrusted with the national honor and defence, but the commons solely hold the purse. I think I have amply shewn that the representation in congress will be totally inadequate in matters of taxation, &c. and, therefore, that the ultimate controul over the purse must be lodged elsewhere. We are not to expect even honest men rigidly to adhere to the line of strict impartiality, where the interest of themselves or friends is particularly concerned; if we do expect it, we shall deceive ourselves, and make a wrong estimate of human nature. But it is asked how shall we remedy the evil, so as to complete and perpetuate the temple of equal laws and equal liberty? Perhaps we never can do it. Possibly we never may be able to do it, in this immense country, under any one system of laws however modified; nevertheless, at present, I think the experiment worth a making. I feel an aversion to the disunion of the states, and to separate confederacies; the states have fought and bled in a common cause, and great dangers too may attend these confederacies. I think the system proposed capable of very considerable degrees of perfection, if we pursue first principles. I do not think that De Lome, or any writer I have seen, has sufficiently pursued the proper inquiries and efficient means for making representation and balances in government more perfect; it is our task to do this in America. Our object is equal liberty, and equal laws diffusing [1006]their influence among all orders of men; to obtain this we must guard against the biass of interest and passions, against interested combinations, secret or open; we must aim at a balance of efforts and strength. Clear it is, by increasing the representation we lessen the prospects of each member of congress being provided for in public offices; we proportionably lessen official influence, and strengthen his prospects of becoming a private citizen, subject to the common burdens, without the compensation of the emoluments of office. By increasing the representation we make it more difficult to corrupt and influence the members; we diffuse them more extensively among the body of the people, perfect the balance, multiply information, strengthen the confidence of the people, and consequently support the laws on equal and free principles. There are two other ways, I think, of obtaining in some degree the security we want; the one is, by excluding more extensively the members from being appointed to offices; the other is, by limiting some of their powers; but these two I shall examine hereafter. LETTER X. January 7, 1788. Dear Sir, It is said that our people have a high sense of freedom, possess power, property, and the strong arm; meaning, I presume, that the body of the people can take care of themselves, and awe their rulers; and, therefore, particular provision in the constitution for their security may not be essential. When I come to examine these observations, they appear to me too triffling and loose to deserve a serious answer. To palliate for the smallness of the representation, it is observed, that the state governments in which the people are fully represented, necessarily form a part of the system. This idea ought to be fully examined. We ought to enquire if the convention have made the proper use of these essential parts; the state governments then we are told will stand between the arbitrary exercise of power and the people: true they may, but armless and helpless, perhaps, with the privilege of making a noise when hurt—this is no more than individuals may do. Does the constitution provide a single check for a single measure, by which the state governments can constitutionally and regularly check the arbitrary measures of congress? Congress may raise immediately fifty thousand men, and twenty millions of dollars in taxes, build a navy, model the militia, &c. and all this constitutionally. Congress may arm on every point, and the state governments can do no more than an individual, by petition to congress, suggest their measures are alarming and not right. I conceive the position to be undeniable, that the federal government will be principally in the hands of the natural aristocracy, and the state governments principally in the hands of the democracy, the representatives of the body of the people. These representatives in Great-Britain hold the purse, and have a negative upon all laws. We must yield to circumstances, and depart something from this plan, and strike out a new medium, so as to give efficacy to the whole system, supply the wants of the union, and leave the several states, or the people assembled in the state legislatures, the means of defence. It has been often mentioned, that the objects of congress will be few and national, and require a small representation; that the objects of each state will be many and local, and require a numerous representation. This circumstance has not the weight of a feather in my mind. It is certainly unadvisable to lodge in 65 representatives, and 26 senators, unlimited power to establish systems of taxation, armies, navies, model the militia, and to do every thing that may essentially tend soon to change, totally, the affairs of the community; and to assemble 1500 state representatives, and 160 senators, to make fence laws, and laws to regulate the descent and conveyance of property, the administration of justice between man and man, to appoint militia officers, &c. It is not merely the quantity of information I contend for. Two taxing powers may be inconvenient; but the point is, congress, like the senate of Rome, will have taxing powers, and the people no check—when the power is abused, the people may complain and grow angry, so may the state governments; they may remonstrate and counteract, by passing laws to prohibit the collection of congressional taxes; but these will be acts of the people, acts of sovereign power, the dernier resort unknown to the constitution; acts operating in terrorum, acts of resistence, and not the exercise of any constitutional power to stop or check a measure before matured: a check properly is the stopping, by one branch in the same legislature, a measure proposed by the other in it. In fact the constitution provides for the states no check, properly speaking, upon the measures of congress—Congress can immediately enlist soldiers, and apply to the pockets of the people. These few considerations bring us to the very strong distinction between the plan that operates on federal principles, and the plan that operates on consolidated principles. A plan may be federal or not as to its organization; each state may retain its vote or not; the sovereignty of the state may be represented, or the people of it. A plan may be federal or not as to its operations—federal when it requires men and monies of the states, and the states as such make the laws for raising [1008]the men and monies—Not federal, when it leaves the states governments out of the question, and operates immediately upon the persons and property of the citizens. The first is the case with the confederation, the second with the new plan: in the first the state governments may be [a] check, in the last none at all. This distinction I shall pursue further hereafter, under the head before mentioned, of amendments as to internal taxes.21 And here I shall pursue a species of checks which writers have not often noticed. To excuse the smallness of the representation, it is said the new congress will be more numerous than the old one. This is not true; and for the facts I refer you to my letter of the 4th instant, to the plan and confederation;22 besides there is no kind of similitude between the two plans. The confederation is a mere league of the states, and congress is formed with the particular checks, and possess the united powers, enumerated in my letter of the 25th ult.23 The new plan is totally a different thing: a national government to many purposes administered, by men chosen for two, four, and six years, not recallable, and among whom there will be no rotation; operating immediately in all money and military matters, &c. on the persons and property of the citizens—I think, therefore, that no part of the confederation ought to be adduced for supporting or injuring the new constitution. It is also said that the constitution gives no more power to congress than the confederation, respecting money and military matters; that congress, under the confederation, may require men and monies to any amount, and the states are bound to comply. This is generally true; but, I think, I shall in a subsequent letter satisfactorily prove, that the states have well founded checks for securing their liberties.24 I admit the force of the observation, that all the federal powers, by the confederation, are lodged in a single assembly; however, I think much more may be said in defence of the leading principles of the confederation. I do not object to the qualifications of the electors of representatives, and I fully agree that the people ought to elect one branch. Further, it may be observed, that the present congress is principally an executive body, which ought not to be numerous; that the house of representatives will be a mere legislative branch, and being the democratic one, ought to be numerous. It is one of the greatest advantages of a government of different branches, that each branch may be conveniently made conformable to the nature of the business assigned it, and all be made conformable to the condition of the several orders of the people. After all the possible checks and limitations we can devise, the powers of the union must be very extensive; the sovereignty of the [1009]nation cannot produce the object in view, the defence and tranquility of the whole, without such powers, executive and judicial. I dislike the present congress a single, assembly, because it is impossible to fit it to receive those powers: the executive and judicial powers, in the nature of things, ought to be lodged in a few hands, the legislature in many hands; therefore, want of safety, and unavoidable hasty measures, out of the question, they never can all be lodged in one assembly properly—it, in its very formation, must imply a contradiction. In objection to increasing the representation, it has also been observed, that it is difficult to assemble a hundred men or more without making them tumultuous and a mere mob; reason and experience do not support this observation. The most respectable assemblies we have any knowledge of and the wisest, have been those, each of which consisted of several hundred members; as the senate of Rome, of Carthage, of Venice, the British Parliament, &c. &c. I think I may without hazarding much, affirm, that our more numerous state assemblies and conventions have universally discovered more wisdom, and as much order, as the less numerous ones: There must be also a very great difference between the characters of two or three hundred men assembled from a single state, and the characters of the number or half the number assembled from all the united states. It is added, that on the proposed plan the house of representatives in fifty or a hundred years, will consist of several hundred members: The plan will begin with sixty-five, and we have no certainty that the number ever will be encreased, for this plain reason—that all that combination of interests and influence which has produced this plan, and supported so far, will constantly oppose the increase of the representation, knowing that thereby the government will become more free and democratic: But admitting, after a few years, there will be a member for each 30,000 inhabitants, the observation is trifling, the government is in a considerable measure to take its tone from its early movements, and by means of a small representation it may in half of 50 or 100 years, get moved from its basis, or at least so far as to be incapable of ever being recovered. We ought, therefore, on every principle now to fix the government on proper principles, and fit to our present condition—when the representation shall become too numerous, alter it; or we may now make provision, that when the representation shall be increased to a given number, that then there shall be one for each given number of inhabitants, &c. Another observation is, that congress will have no temptations to do wrong—the men that make it must be very uninformed, or suppose they are talking to children. In the first place, the members will be [1010]governed by all those motives which govern the conduct of men, and have before them all the allurements of offices and temptations, to establish unequal burdens, before described. In the second place, they and their friends, probably, will find it for their interests to keep up large armies, navies, salaries, &c. and in laying adequate taxes. In the third place, we have no good grounds to presume, from reason or experience, that it will be agreeable to their characters or views, that the body of the people should continue to have power effectually to interfere in the affairs of government. But it is confidently added, that congress will not have it in their power to oppress or enslave the people, that the people will not bear it. It is not supposed that congress will act the tyrant immediately, and in the face of day light. It is not supposed congress will adopt important measures, without plausible pretences, especially those which may tend to alarm or produce opposition. We are to consider the natural progress of things: that men unfriendly to republican equality will go systematically to work, gradually to exclude the body of the people from any share in the government, first of the substance, and then of the forms. The men who will have these views will not be without their agents and supporters. When we reflect, that a few years ago we established democratic republics, and fixed the state governments as the barriers between congress and the pockets of the people; what great progress has been made in less than seven years to break down those barriers, and essentially to change the principles of our governments, even by the armless few: is it chimerical to suppose that in fifteen or twenty years to come, that much more can be performed, especially after the adoption of the constitution, when the few will be so much better armed with power and influence, to continue the struggle? probably, they will be wise enough never to alarm, but gradually prepare the minds of the people for one specious change after another, till the final object shall be obtained. Say the advocates, these are only possibilities—they are probabilities, a wise people ought to guard against; and the address made use of to keep the evils out of sight, and the means to prevent them, confirm my opinion. But to obviate all objections to the proposed plan in the last resort: it is said our people will be free, so long as they possess the habits of freemen, and when they lose them, they must receive some other forms of government. To this I shall only observe, that this is very humiliating language, and can, I trust, never suit a manly people, who have contended nobly for liberty, and declared to the world they will be free. I have dwelt much longer than I expected upon the increasing the representation, the democratic interest in the federal system; but I [1011]hope the importance of the subject will justify my dwelling upon it. I have pursued it in a manner new, and I have found it necessary to be somewhat prolix, to illustrate the point I had in view. My idea has ever been, when the democratic branch is weak and small, the body of the people have no defence, and every thing to fear; if they expect to find genuine political friends in kings and nobles, in great and powerful men, they deceive themselves. On the other hand, fix a genuine democratic branch in the government, solely to hold the purse, and with the power of impeachment, and to propose and negative laws, cautiously limit the king and nobles, or the executive and the senate, as the case may be, and the people, I conceive, have but little to fear, and their liberties will be always secure. I think we are now arrived to a new era in the affairs of men, when the true principles of government will be more fully unfolded than heretofore, and a new world, as it were, grow up in America. In contemplating representation, the next thing is the security of elections. Before I proceed to this, I beg leave to observe, that the pay of the representatives of the people is essentially connected with their interests. Congress may put the pay of the members unreasonably high, or so low as that none but the rich and opulent can attend; there are very strong reasons for supposing the latter, probably, will be the case, and a part of the same policy, which uniformly and constantly exerts itself to transfer power from the many to the few. Should the pay be well fixed, and made alterable by congress, with the consent of a majority of the state legislatures, perhaps, all the evils to be feared on this head might, in the best practicable manner, be guarded against, and proper security introduced. It is said the state legislatures fix their own pay—the answer is, that congress is not, nor can it ever be well formed on those equal principles the state legislatures are. I shall not dwell on this point, but conclude this letter with one general observation, that the check[s] I contend for in the system proposed, do not, in the least, any of them tend to lessen the energy of it; but giving grounds for the confidence of the people, greatly to increase its real energy, by insuring their constant and hearty support. LETTER XI. January 10, 1788. Dear Sir, I shall now add a few observations respecting the organization of the senate, the manner of appointing it, and its powers. The senate is an assembly of 26 members, two from each state, though the senators are apportioned on the federal plan, they will vote [1012]individually; they represent the states, as bodies politic, sovereign to certain purposes; the states being sovereign and independent, are all considered equal, each with the other in the senate. In this we are governed solely by the ideal equalities of sovereignties; the federal and state governments forming one whole, and the state governments an essential part, which ought always to be kept distinctly in view, and preserved: I feel more disposed, on reflection, to acquiesce in making them the basis of the senate, and thereby to make it the interest and duty of the senators to preserve distinct, and to perpetuate the respective sovereignties they shall represent. As to the appointments of senators, I have already observed, that they must be appointed by the legislatures, by concurrent acts, and each branch have an equal share of power, as I do not see any probability of amendments, if advisable, in these points, I shall not dwell upon them. The senate, as a legislative branch, is not large, but as an executive branch quite too numerous. It is not to be presumed that we can form a genuine senatorial branch in the United States, a real representation of the aristocracy and balance in the legislature, any more than we can form a genuine representation of the people. Could we separate the aristocratical and democratical interests; compose the senate of the former, and the house of assembly of the latter, they are too unequal in the United States to produce a balance. Form them on pure principles, and leave each to be supported by its real weight and connections, the senate would be feeble, and the house powerful:—I say, on pure principles; because I make a distinction between a senate that derives its weight and influence from a pure source, its numbers and wisdom, its extensive property, its extensive and permanent connections; and a senate composed of a few men, possessing small property, small and unstable connections, that derives its weight and influence from a corrupt or pernicious source; that is, merely from the power given it by the constitution and laws, to dispose of the public offices, and the annexed emoluments, and by those means to interest officers, and the hungry expectants of offices, in support of its measures. I wish the proposed senate may not partake too much of the latter description. To produce a balance and checks, the constitution proposes two branches in the legislature; but they are so formed, that the members of both must generally be the same kind of men—men having similar interests and views, feelings and connections—men of the same grade in society, and who associate on all occasions (probably, if there be any difference, the senators will be the most democratic.) Senators and representatives thus circumstanced, as men, though convened in two [1013]rooms, to make laws, must be governed generally by the same motives and views, and therefore pursue the same system of politics; the partitions between the two branches will be merely those of the building in which they sit: there will not be found in them any of those genuine balances and checks, among the real different interests, and efforts of the several classes of men in the community we aim at; nor can any such balances and checks be formed in the present condition of the United States in any considerable degree of perfection: but to give them the greatest degree of perfection practicable, we ought to make the senate respectable as to numbers, the qualifications of the electors and of the elected; to increase the numbers of the representatives, and so to model the elections of them, as always to draw a majority of them substantially from the body of the people. Though I conclude the senators and representatives will not form in the legislature those balances and checks which correspond with the actual state of the people; yet I approve of two branches, because we may notwithstanding derive several advantages from them. The senate, from the mode of its appointment, will probably be influenced to support the state governments, and, from its periods of service will produce stability in legislation, while frequent elections may take place in the other branch. There is generally a degree of competition between two assemblies even composed of the same kind of men; and by this, and by means of every law’s passing a revision in the second branch, caution, coolness, and deliberation are produced in the business of making laws. By means of a democratic branch we may particularly secure personal liberty; and by means of a senatorial branch we may particularly protect property. By the division, the house becomes the proper body to impeach all officers for misconduct in office, and the senate the proper court to try them; and in a country where limited powers must be lodged in the first magistrate, the senate, perhaps, may be the most proper body to be found to have a negative upon him in making treaties, and in managing foreign affairs. Though I agree the federal senate, in the form proposed, may be useful to many purposes, and that it is not very necessary to alter the organization, modes of appointment, and powers of it in several respects; yet, without alterations in others, I sincerely believe it will, in a very few years, become the source of the greatest evils. Some of these alterations, I conceive, to be absolutely necessary, and some of them at least advisable. 1. By the confederation the members of congress are chosen annually. By art. 1. sect. 2. of the constitution, the senators shall be chosen for six years. As the period of service must be, in a considerable degree, [1014]matter of opinion on this head, I shall only make a few observations, to explain why I think it more advisable to limit it to three or four years. The people of this country have not been accustomed to so long appointments in their state governments, they have generally adopted annual elections. The members of the present congress are chosen yearly, who, from the nature and multip[l]icity of their business, ought to be chosen for longer periods than the federal senators—Men six years in office absolutely contract callous habits, and cease, in too great a degree, to feel their dependance, and for the condition of their constituents. Senators continued in offices three or four years, will be in them longer than any popular erroneous opinions will probably continue to actuate their electors—men appointed for three or four years, will generally be long enough in office to give stability, and amply to acquire political information. By a change of legislators, as often as circumstances will permit, political knowledge is diffused more extensively among the people, and the attention of the electors and elected more constantly kept alive; circumstances of infinite importance in a free country. Other reasons might be added, but my subject is too extensive to admit of my dwelling upon less material points. 2. When the confederation was formed, it was considered essentially necessary that the members of congress should at any time be recalled by their respective states, when the states should see fit, and others be sent in their room. I do not think it less necessary that this principle should be extended to the members of congress under the new constitution, and especially to the senators. I have had occasion several times to observe, that let us form a federal constitution as extensively, and on the best principles in our power, we must, after all, trust a vast deal to a few men, who, far removed from their constituents, will administer the federal government; there is but little danger these men will feel too great a degree of dependance: the necessary and important object to be attended to, is to make them feel dependant enough. Men elected for several years, several hundred miles distant from their states, possessed of very extensive powers, and the means of paying themselves, will not, probably, be oppressed with a sense of dependance and responsibility. The senators will represent sovereignties, which generally have, and always ought to retain, the power of recalling their agents; the principle of responsibility is strongly felt in men who are liable to be recalled and censured for their misconduct; and, if we may judge from experience, the latter will not abuse the power of recalling their members; to possess it, will, at least be a valuable check. It is in the nature of all [1015]delegated power, that the constituents should retain the right to judge concerning the conduct of their representatives; they must exercise the power, and their decision itself, their approving or disapproving that conduct implies a right, a power to continue in office, or to remove from it. But whenever the substitute acts under a constitution, then it becomes necessary that the power of recalling him be expressed. The reasons for lodging a power to recall are stronger, as they respect the senate, than as they respect the representatives; the latter will be more frequently elected, and changed of course, and being chosen by the people at large, it would be more difficult for the people than for the legislatures to take the necessary measures for recalling: but even the people, if the powers will be more beneficial to them than injurious, ought to possess it. The people are not apt to wrong a man who is steady and true to their interests; they may for a while be misled by party representations, and leave a good man out of office unheard; but every recall supposes a deliberate decision, and a fair hearing; and no man who believes his conduct proper, and the result of honest views, will be the less useful in his public character, on account of the examination his actions may be liable to; and a man conscious of the contrary conduct, ought clearly to be restrained by the apprehensions of a trial. I repeat it, it is interested combinations and factions we are particularly to guard against in the federal government, and all the rational means that can be put into the hands of the people to prevent them, ought to be provided and furnished for them. Where there is a power to recall, trusty centinels among the people, or in the state legislatures, will have a fair opportunity to become useful. If the members in congress from the states join in such combinations, or favour them, or pursue a pernicious line of conduct, the most attentive among the people, or in the state legislatures, may formally charge them before their constituents; the very apprehensions of such constitutional charges may prevent many of the evils mentioned, and the recalling the members of a single state, a single senator, or representative, may often prevent many more; nor do I, at present, discover any danger in such proceedings, as every man who shall move for a recall will put his reputation at stake, to shew he has reasonable grounds for his motion; and it is not probable such motions will be made unless there be good apparent grounds for succeeding; nor can the charge or motion be any thing more than the attack of an individual or individuals, unless a majority of the constituents shall see cause to go into the enquiry. Further, the circumstance of such a power being lodged in the constituents, will tend continually to keep up their watchfulness, as well as the attention and dependance of the federal senators and representatives. By the confederation it is provided, that no delegate shall serve more than three years in any term of six years, and thus, by the forms of the government, a rotation of members is produced: a like principle has been adopted in some of the state governments, and also in some antient and modern republics. Whether this exclusion of a man for a given period, after he shall have served a given time, ought to be ingraf[t]ed into a constitution or not, is a question, the proper decision materially depends upon the leading features of the government: some governments are so formed as to produce a sufficient fluctuation and change of members of course, in the ordinary course of elections, proper numbers of new members are, from time to time, brought into the legislature, and a proportionate number of old ones go out, mix, and become diffused among the people. This is the case with all numerous representative legislatures, the members of which are frequently elected, and constantly within the view of their constituents. This is the case with our state governments, and in them a constitutional rotation is unimportant. But in a government consisting of but a few members, elected for long periods, and far removed from the observation of the people, but few changes in the ordinary course of elections take place among the members; they become in some measure a fixed body, and often inattentive to the public good, callous, selfish, and the fountain of corruption. To prevent these evils, and to force a principle of pure animation into the federal government, which will be formed much in this last manner mentioned, and to produce attention, activity, and a diffusion of knowledge in the community, we ought to establish among others the principle of rotation. Even good men in office, in time, imperceptibly lose sight of the people, and gradually fall into measures prejudicial to them. It is only a rotation among the members of the federal legislature I shall contend for: judges and officers at the heads of the judicial and executive departments, are in a very different situation, their offices and duties require the information and studies of many years for performing them in a manner advantageous to the people. These judges and officers must apply their whole time to the detail business of their offices, and depend on them for their support; then they always act under masters or superiors, and may be removed from office for misconduct; they pursue a certain round of executive business: their offices must be in all societies confined to a few men, because but few can become qualified to fill them: and were they, by annual appointments, open to the people at large, they are offices of such a nature as to be of no service to them; they must leave these offices in the possession of the few individuals qualified to fill them, or have them badly filled. In the judicial and executive [1017]departments also, the body of the people possess a large share of power and influence, as jurors and subordinate officers, among whom there are many and frequent rotations. But in every free country the legislatures are all on a level, and legislation becomes partial whenever, in practice, it rests for any considerable time in a few hands. It is the true republican principle to diffuse the power of making the laws among the people, and so to modify the forms of the government as to draw in turn the well informed of every class into the legislature. To determine the propriety or impropriety of this rotation, we must take the inconveniencies as well as the advantages attending it into view: on the one hand, by this rotation, we may sometimes exclude good men from being elected. On the other hand, we guard against those pernicious connections, which usually grow up among men left to continue long periods in office, we increase the number of those who make the laws and return to their constituents; and thereby spread information, and preserve a spirit of activity and investigation among the people: hence a balance of interests and exertions are preserved, and the ruinous measures of factions rendered more impracticable. I would not urge the principle of rotation, if I believed the consequence would be an uninformed federal legislature; but I have no apprehension of this in this enlightened country. The members of congress, at any one time, must be but very few, compared with the respectable well informed men in the United States; and I have no idea there will be any want of such men for members of congress, though by a principle of rotation the constitution should exclude from being elected for two years those federal legislators, who may have served the four years immediately preceding, or any four years in the six preceding years. If we may judge from experience and fair calculations, this principle will never operate to exclude at any one period a fifteenth part, even of those men who have been members of congress. Though no man can sit in congress, by the confederation, more than three years in any term of six years, yet not more than three, four, or five men in any one state, have been made ineligible at any one period; and if a good man happen to be excluded by this rotation, it is only for a short time. All things considered, the inconveniencies of the principle must be very inconsiderable compared with the many advantages of it. It will generally be expedient for a man who has served four years in congress to return home, mix with the people, and reside some time with them: this will tend to reinstate him in the interests, feelings, and views similar to theirs, and thereby confirm in him the essential qualifications of a legislator. Even in point of information, it may be observed, the useful information of legislators is not acquired merely in studies in offices, [1018]and in meeting to make laws from day to day; they must learn the actual situation of the people, by being among them, and when they have made laws, return home, and observe how they operate. Thus occasionally to be among the people, is not only necessary to prevent or banish the callous habits and self-interested views of office in legislators, but to afford them necessary information, and to render them useful: another valuable end is answered by it, sympathy, and the means of communication between them and their constituents, is substantially promoted; so that on every principle legislators, at certain periods, ought to live among their constituents. Some men of science are undoubtedly necessary in every legislature; but the knowledge, generally, necessary for men who make laws, is a knowledge of the common concerns, and particular circumstances of the people. In a republican government seats in the legislature are highly honorable; I believe but few do, and surely none ought to consider them as places of profit and permanent support. Were the people always properly attentive, they would, at proper periods, call their lawmakers home, by sending others in their room: but this is not often the case, and therefore, in making constitutions, when the people are attentive, they ought cautiously to provide for those benefits, those advantageous changes in the administration of their affairs, which they are often apt to be inattentive to in practice. On the whole, to guard against the evils, and to secure the advantages I have mentioned, with the greatest degree of certainty, we ought clearly, in my opinion, to increase the federal representation, to secure elections on proper principles, to establish a right to recall members, and a rotation among them.25 4. By the art. 2. sect. 2. treaties must be made with the advice and consent of the senate, and two-thirds of those present must concur: also, with consent of the senate, almost all federal officers, civil and military, must be appointed. As to treaties I have my doubts; but as to the appointments of officers, I think we may clearly shew the senate to be a very improper body indeed to have any thing to do with them. I am not perfectly satisfied, that the senate, a branch of the legislature, and court for trying impeachments, ought to have a controuling power in making all treaties; yet, I confess, I do not discern how a restraint upon the president in this important business, can be better or more safely lodged: a power to make and conclude all treaties is too important to be vested in him alone, or in him and an executive council, only sufficiently numerous for other purpose[s], and the house of representatives is too numerous to be concerned in treaties of peace and of alliance. This power is now lodged in congress, to be exercised by [1019]the consent of nine states. The federal senate, like the delegations in the present congress, will represent the states, and the consent of two-thirds of that senate will bear some similitude to the consent of nine states. It is probable the United States will not make more than one treaty, on an average, in two or three years, and this power may always be exercised with great deliberation: perhaps the senate is sufficiently numerous to be trusted with this power, sufficiently small to proceed with secrecy, and sufficiently permanent to exercise this power with proper consistency and due deliberation. To lodge this power in a less respectable and less numerous body might not be safe; we must place great confidence in the hands that hold it, and we deceive ourselves if we give it under an idea, that we can impeach, to any valuable purpose, the man or men who may abuse it. On a fair construction of the constitution, I think the legislature has a proper controul over the president and senate in settling commercial treaties. By art. 1. sect. 2. the legislature will have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, &c. By art. 2. sect. 2. the president, with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the senate, may make treaties. These clauses must be considered together, and we ought never to make one part of the same instrument contradict another, if it can be avoided by any reasonable construction. By the first recited clause, the legislature has the power, that is, as I understand it, the sole power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, or to make all the rules and regulations respecting trade and commerce between our citizens and foreigners: by the second recited clause, the president and senate have power generally to make treaties.—There are several kinds of treaties—as treaties of commerce, of peace, of alliance, &c. I think the words to “make treaties,” may be consistently construed, and yet so as it shall be left to the legislature to confirm commercial treaties; they are in their nature and operation very distinct from treaties of peace and of alliance; the latter generally require secrecy, it is but very seldom they interfere with the laws and internal police of the country; to make them is properly the exercise of executive powers, and the constitution authorises the president and senate to make treaties, and gives the legislature no power, directly or indirectly, respecting these treaties of peace and alliance. As to treaties of commerce, they do not generally require secrecy, they almost always involve in them legislative powers, interfere with the laws and internal police of the country, and operate immediately on persons and property, especially in the commercial towns: (they have in Great-Britain usually been confirmed by parliament;) they consist of rules and regulations respecting commerce; and to regulate commerce, or to make regulations respecting commerce, [1020]the federal legislature, by the constitution, has the power. I do not see that any commercial regulations can be made in treaties, that will not infringe upon this power in the legislature; therefore, I infer, that the true construction is, that the president and senate shall make treaties; but all commercial treaties shall be subject to be confirmed by the legislature. This construction will render the clauses consistent, and make the powers of the president and senate, respecting treaties, much less exceptionable. LETTER XII. January 12, 1788. Dear Sir, On carefully examining the parts of the proposed system, respecting the elections of senators, and especially of the representatives, they appear to me to be both ambiguous and very defective. I shall endeavour to pursue a course of reasoning, which shall fairly lead to establishing the impartiality and security of elections, and then to point out an amendment in this respect. It is well observed by Montesquieu, that in republican governments, the forms of elections are fundamental; and that it is an essential part of the social compact, to ascertain by whom, to whom, when, and in what manner suffrages are to be given.26 Wherever we find the regulation of elections have not been carefully fixed by the constitution, or the principles of them, we constantly see the legislatures new modifying its own form, and changing the spirit of the government to answer partial purposes. By the proposed plan it is fixed, that the qualifications of the electors of the federal representatives shall be the same as those of the electors of state representatives; though these vary some in the several states the electors are fixed and designated. The qualifications of the representatives are also fixed and designated, and no person under 25 years of age, not an inhabitant of the state, and not having been seven years a citizen of the United States, can be elected; the clear inference is, that all persons 25 years of age, and upwards, inhabitants of the state, and having been, at any period or periods, seven years citizens of the United States, may be elected representatives. They have a right to be elected by the constitution, and the electors have a right to chuse them. This is fixing the federal representation, as to the elected, on a very broad basis: it can be no objection to the elected, that they are Christians, Pagans, Mahometans, or Jews; that they are of any colour, rich or poor, convict or not: Hence many men may be elected, who cannot be electors. Gentlemen who [1021]have commented so largely upon the wisdom of the constitution, for excluding from being elected young men under a certain age, would have done well to have recollected, that it positively makes pagans, convicts, &c. eligible. The people make the constitution; they exclude a few persons, by certain descriptions, from being elected, and all not thus excluded are clearly admitted. Now a man 25 years old, an inhabitant of the state, and having been a citizen of the the states seven years, though afterwards convicted, may be elected, because not within any of the excluding clauses, the same of a beggar, an absentee, &c. The right of the electors, and eligibility of the elected being fixed by the people, they cannot be narrowed by the state legislatures, or congress: it is established, that a man being (among other qualifications) an inhabitant of the state, shall be eligible. Now it would be narrowing the right of the people to confine them in their choice to a man, an inhabitant of a particular county or district in the state. Hence it follows, that neither the state legislatures or congress can establish district elections; that is, divide the state into districts, and confine the electors of each district to the choice of a man resident in it. If the electors could be thus limited in one respect, they might in another be confined to chuse a man of a particular religion, of certain property, &c. and thereby half of the persons made eligible by the constitution be excluded. All laws, therefore, for regulating elections must be made on the broad basis of the constitution. Next, we may observe, that representatives are to be chosen by the people of the state. What is a choice by the people of the state? If each given district in it choose one, will that be a choice within the meaning of the constitution? Must the choice be by plurality of votes, or a majority? In connection with these questions, we must take the 4th sect, art. 1. where it is said the state legislatures shall prescribe the times, places, and manner of holding elections; but congress may make or alter such regulations. By this clause, I suppose, the electors of different towns and districts in the state may be assembled in different places, to give their votes; but when so assembled, by another clause they cannot, by congress or the state legislatures, be restrained from giving their votes for any man an inhabitant of the state, and qualified as to age, and having been a citizen the time required. But I see nothing in the constitution by which to decide, whether the choice shall be by a plurality or a majority of votes: this, in my mind, is by far the most important question in the business of elections. When we say a representative shall be chosen by the people, it seems to imply that he shall be chosen by a majority of them; but states which use the same phraseology in [1022]this respect, practice both ways. I believe a majority of the states, chuse by pluralities, and, I think it probable, that the federal house of representatives will decide that a choice of its members by pluralities is constitutional. A man who has the most votes is chosen in Great-Britain. It is this, among other things, that gives every man fair play in the game of influence and corruption. I believe that not much stress was laid upon the objection that congress may assemble the electors at some out of the way place. However, the advocates seem to think they obtain a victory of no small glory and importance, when they can shew, with some degree of colour, that the evils is rather a possibility than a probability. When I observed that the elections were not secured on proper principles,27 I had an idea of far more probable and extensive evils, secret mischiefs, and not so glaring transgressions, the exclusions of proper district elections, and of the choice by a majority. It is easy to perceive that there is an essential difference between elections by pluralities and by majorities, between choosing a man in a small or limited district, and choosing a number of men promiscuously by the people of a large state; and while we are almost secure of judicious unbiassed elections by majorities in such districts, we have no security against deceptions, influence and corruption in states or large districts in electing by pluralities. When a choice is made by a plurality of votes, it is often made by a very small part of the electors, who attend and give their votes, when by a majority, never by so few as one half of them. The partialities and improprieties attending the former mode may be illustrated by a case that lately happened in one of the middle states.—Several representatives were to be chosen by a large number of inhabitants compactly settled, among whom there were four or five thousand voters. Previous to the time of election a number of lists of candidates were published, to divide and distract the voters in general—about half a dozen men of some influence, who had a favourite list to carry, met several times, fixed their list, and agreed to hand it about among all who could probably be induced to adopt it, and to circulate the other lists among their opponents, to divide them. The poll was opened, and several hundred electors, suspecting nothing, attended and put in their votes; the list of the half dozen was carried, and men were found to be chosen, some of whom were very disagreeable to a large majority of the electors: though several hundred electors voted, men on that list were chosen who had only 45, 43, 44, &c. votes each; they had a plurality, that is, more than any other persons: the [1023]votes generally were scattered, and those who made even a feeble combination succeeded in placing highest upon the list several very un-thought of and very unpopular men. This evil never could have happened in a town where all the voters meet in one place, and consider no man as elected unless he have a majority, or more than half of all the votes; clear it is, that the men on whom thus but a small part of the votes are bestowed, cannot possess the confidence of the people, or have any considerable degree of influence over them. But as partial, as liable to secret influence, and corruption as the choice by pluralities may be, I think, we cannot avoid it, without essentially increasing the federal representation, and adopting the principles of district elections. There is but one case in which the choice by the majority is practicable, and that is, where districts are formed of such moderate extent that the electors in each can conveniently meet in one place, and at one time, and proceed to the choice of a representative; when, if no man have a majority, or more than half of all the votes the first time, the voters may examine the characters of those brought forward, accommodate, and proceed to repeat their votes till some one shall have that majority. This, I believe, cannot be a case under the constitution proposed in its present form. To explain my ideas, take Massachusetts, for instance, she is entitled to eight representatives, she has 370,000 inhabitants, about 46,000 to one representative; if the elections be so held that the electors throughout the state meet in their several towns or places, and each elector puts in his vote for eight representatives, the votes of the electors will ninety-nine times in a hundred, be so scattered that on collecting the votes from the several towns or places, no men will be found, each of whom have a majority of the votes, and therefore the election will not be made. On the other hand, there may be such a combination of votes, that in thus attempting to chuse eight representatives, the electors may chuse even fifteen. Suppose 10,000 voters to attend and give their votes, each voter will give eight votes, one for each of eight representatives; in the whole 80,000 votes will be given—eight men, each having 5001 votes, in the whole 40,008 will have each a majority, and be chosen—39,092 votes will be bestowed on other men, and if they all be bestowed on seven men, they may have each a considerable majority, and also be chosen. This indeed is a very rare combination; but the bestowing all the votes pretty equally upon nine, ten, or eleven men, and chusing them all, is an event too probable not to be guarded against. If Massachusetts be divided into eight districts, each having about 46,000 inhabitants, and each district directed to chuse one representative, it will be found totally impracticable for the electors of it to meet [1024]in one place; and, when they meet in several towns and places in the district, they will vote for different men, and nineteen times in twenty, so scatter their votes, that no one man will have a majority of the whole and be chosen: we must, therefore, take the man who has the most votes, whether he has three quarters, one quarter, or one tenth part of the whole; the inconveniencies of scattering votes will be increased, as men not of the district, as well as those that are in it, may be voted for.28 I might add many other observations to evince the superiority and solid advantages of proper district elections, and a choice by a majority, and to prove, that many evils attend the contrary practice: these evils we must encounter as the constitution now stands. I see no way to fix elections on a proper footing, and to render tolerably equal and secure the federal representation, but by increasing the representation, so as to have one representative for each district in which the electors may conveniently meet in one place, and at one time, and chuse by a majority. Perhaps this might be effected pretty generally, by fixing one representative for each twelve thousand inhabitants; dividing, or fixing the principles for dividing the states into proper districts; and directing the electors of each district to the choice, by a majority, of some men having a permanent interest and residence in it. I speak of a representation tolerably equal, &c. because I am still of opinion, that it is impracticable in this extensive country to have a federal representation sufficiently democratic, or substantially drawn from the body of the people: the principles just mentioned may be the best practical ones we can expect to establish. By thus increasing the representation, we not only make it more democratical and secure, strengthen the confidence of the people in it, and thereby render it more nervous29 and energetic; but it will also enable the people essentially to change, for the better, the principles and forms of elections. To provide for the people’s wandering throughout the state for a representative, may sometimes enable them to elect a more brilliant or an abler man, than by confining them to districts, but generally this latitude will be used to pernicious purposes, especially connected with the choice by plurality; when a man in the remote part of the state, perhaps, obnoxious at home, but ambitious and intriguing, may be chosen to represent the people in another part of the state far distant, and by a small part of them, or by a faction, or by a combination of some particular description of men among them. This has been long the case in Great-Britain, it is the case in several of the states, nor do I think that such pernicious practices will be merely possible in our federal [1025]concerns, but highly probable. By establishing district elections, we exclude none of the best men from being elected; and we fix what, in my mind, is of far more importance than brilliant talents, I mean a sameness, as to residence and interests, between the representative and his constituents; and by the election by a majority, he is sure to be the man, the choice of more than half of them. Though it is impossible to put elections on a proper footing as the constitution stands, yet I think regulations respecting them may be introduced of considerable service: it is not only, therefore, important to enquire how they may be made, but also what body has the controuling power over them. An intelligent, free and unbiassed choice of representatives by the people is of the last importance: we must then carefully guard against all combinations, secret arts, and influence to the contrary. Various expedients have been adopted in different countries and states to effect genuine elections; as the constitution now stands, I confess, I do not discover any better than those adopted in Connecticut, in the choice of counsellers, before mentioned.30 The federal representatives are to be chosen every second year (an odd mode of expression). In all the states, except South-Carolina, the people, the same electors, meet twice in that time to elect state representatives. For instance, let the electors in Massachusetts, when they meet to chuse state representatives, put in their votes for eight federal representatives, the number that state may chuse, (merely for distinction sake, we may call these the votes of nomination), and return a list of the men voted for, in the several towns and places, to the legislature, or some proper body; let this list be immediately examined and published, and some proper number, say 15 or 20, who shall have the most votes upon the list, be sent out to the people; and when the electors shall meet the next year to chuse state representatives, let them put in their votes for the eight federal representatives, confining their votes to the proper number so sent out; and let the eight highest of those thus voted for in the two votes (which we may call, by way of distinction, votes of election), be the federal representatives: thus a choice may be made by the people, once in two years, without much trouble and expence, and, I believe, with some degree of security. As soon as the votes of nomination shall be collected and made known, the people will know who are voted for, and who are candidates for their votes the succeeding year; the electors will have near a year to enquire into their characters and politics, and also into any undue means, if any were taken, to bring any of them forward; and such as they find to be the best men, and agreeable to the people, they may vote for in giving the [1026]votes of election. By these means the men chosen will ultimately always have a majority, or near a majority, of the votes of the electors, who shall attend and give their votes. The mode itself will lead to the discovery of truth and of political characters, and to prevent private combinations, by rendering them in a great measure of no effect. As the choice is to be made by the people, all combinations and checks must be confined to their votes. No supplying the want of a majority by the legislatures, as in Massachusetts in the choice of senators,31 &c. can be admitted: the people generally judge right when informed, and, in giving their votes the second time, they may always correct their former errors. I think we are all sufficiently acquainted with the progress of elections to see, that the regulations, as to times, places, and the manner merely of holding elections, may, under the constitution, easily be made useful or injurious. It is important then to enquire, who has the power to make regulations, and who ought to have it. By the constitution, the state legislatures shall prescribe the times, places, and manner of holding elections, but congress may make or alter such regulations. Power in congress merely to alter those regulations, made by the states, could answer no valuable purposes; the states might make, and congress alter them ad infinitum: and when the state should cease to make, or should annihilate its regulations, congress would have nothing to alter. But the states shall make regulations, and congress may make such regulations as the clause stands: the true construction is, that when congress shall see fit to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections, congress may do it, and state regulations, on this head, must cease: for if state regulations could exist, after congress should make a system of regulations, there would, or might, be two incompatible systems of regulations relative to the same subject. It has been often urged, that congress ought to have power to make these regulations, otherwise the state legislatures, by neglecting to make provision for elections, or by making improper regulations, may destroy the general government. It is very improbable that any state legislature will adopt measures to destroy the representation of its own constituents in congress, especially when the state must, represented in congress or not, pay its proportion of the expence of keeping up the government, and even of the representatives of the other states, and be subject to their laws. Should the state legislatures be disposed to be negligent, or to combine to break up congress, they have a very simple way to do it, as the constitution now stands—they have only to neglect to chuse senators, or to appoint the electors of the president, and vice-president: there is no remedy provided against these last evils: nor is it [1027]to be presumed, that if a sufficient number of state legislatures to break up congress, should, by neglect or otherwise, attempt to do it, that the people, who yearly elect those legislatures, would elect under the regulations of congress. These and many other reasons must evince, that it was not merely to prevent an annihilation of the federal government that congress has power to regulate elections. It has been urged also, that the state legislatures chuse the federal senators, one branch, and may injure the people, who chuse the other, by improper regulations; that therefore congress, in which the people will immediately have one, the representative branch, ought to have power to interfere in behalf of the people, and rectify such improper regulations. The advocates have said much about the opponents dwelling upon possibilities: but to suppose the people will find it necessary to appeal to congress to restrain the oppressions of the state legislatures, is supposing a possibility indeed. Can any man in his senses suppose that the state legislatures, which are so numerous as almost to be the people themselves, all branches of them depending yearly, for the most part, on the elections of the people, will abuse them in regulating federal elections, and make it proper to transfer the power to congress, a body, one branch of which is chosen once in six years by these very legislatures, and the other biennially, and not half so numerous as even the senatorial branches in those legislatures? Senators are to be chosen by the state legislatures, where there are two branches the appointment must be, I presume, by a concurrent resolution, in passing which, as in passing all other legislative acts, each branch will have a negative; this will give the senatorial branch just as much weight in the appointment as the democratic: the two branches form a legislature only when acting separately, and therefore, whenever the members of the two branches meet, mix and vote individually in one room, for making an election, it is expressly so directed by the constitutions. If the constitution, by fixing the choice to be made by the legislatures, has given each branch an equal vote, as I think it has, it cannot be altered by any regulations. On the whole, I think, all general principles respecting electors ought to be carefully established by the constitution, as the qualifications of the electors and of elected: the number of the representatives, and the inhabitants of each given district, called on to chuse a man from among themselves by a majority of votes; leaving it to the legislature only so to regulate, from time to time, the extent of the districts so as to keep the representatives proportionate to the number of inhabitants in the several parts of the country; and so far as regulations as to elections cannot be fixed by the constitution, they ought to be [1028]left to the state legislatures, they coming far nearest to the people themselves; at most, congress ought to have power to regulate elections only where a state shall neglect to make them. LETTER XIII. January 14, 1788. Dear Sir, In this letter I shall further examine two clauses in the proposed constitution respecting appointments to office.—By art. 2. sect. 2. the president shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments, &c. By art. 1, sect. 6. No senator or representative shall, during the term for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time. Thus the president must nominate, and the senate concur in the appointment of all federal officers, civil and military, and the senators and representatives are made ineligible only to the few civil offices abovementioned. To preserve the federal government pure and un-corrupt, peculiar precautions relative to appointments to office will be found highly necessary from the very forms and character of the government itself. The honours and emoluments of public offices are the objects in all communities, that ambitious and necessitous men never lose sight of. The honest, the modest, and the industrious part of the community content themselves, generally, with their private concerns; they do not solicit those offices which are the perpetual source of cabals, intrigues, and contests among men of the former description, men embarrassed, intriguing, and destitute of modesty. Even in the most happy country and virtuous government, corrupt influence in appointments cannot always be avoided; perhaps we may boast of our share of virtue as a people, and if we are only sufficiently aware of the influence, biasses, and prejudices, common to the affairs of men, we may go far towards guarding against the effects of them. We all agree, that a large standing army has a strong tendency to depress and inslave the people; it is equally true that a large body of selfish, unfeeling, unprincipled civil officers has a like, or a more pernicious tendency to the same point. Military, and especially civil establishments, are the necessary appendages of society; they are deductions from productive labour, and substantial wealth, in proportion to the number of men employed in them; they are oppressive where unnecessarily extended and supported by men unfriendly to the people; they [1029]are injurious when too small, and supported by men too timid and dependant. It is of the last importance to decide well upon the necessary number of offices, to fill them with proper characters, and to establish efficiently the means of punctually punishing those officers who may do wrong. To discern the nature and extent of this power of appointments, we need only to consider the vast number of officers necessary to execute a national system in this extensive country, the prodigious biasses the hopes and expectations of offices have on their conduct, and the influence public officers have among the people—these necessary officers, as judges, state’s attornies, clerks, sheriffs, &c. in the federal supreme and inferior courts, admirals and generals, and subordinate officers in the army and navy, ministers, consuls, &c. sent to foreign countries; officers in the federal city, in the revenue, post office departments, &c. &c. must, probably, amount to several thousands, without taking into view the very inferior ones. There can be no doubt but that the most active men in politics, in and out of congress, will be the foremost candidates for the best of these offices; the man or men who shall have the disposal of them, beyond dispute, will have by far the greatest share of active influence in the government; but appointments must be made, and who shall make them? what modes of appointments will be attended with the fewest inconveniencies? is the question. The senators and representatives are the law makers, create all offices, and whenever they see fit, they impeach and try officers for misconduct; they ought to be in session but part of the year, and as legislators, they must be too numerous to make appointments, perhaps, a few very important ones excepted. In contemplating the necessary officers of the union, there appear to be six different modes in which, in whole or in part, the appointments may be made, 1. By the legislature; 2. by the president and senate—3. by the president and an executive council—4. by the president alone—5. by the heads of the departments—and 6. by the state governments—Among all these, in my opinion, there may be an advantageous distribution of the power of appointments. In considering the legislators, in relation to the subject before us, two interesting questions particularly arise—1. Whether they ought to be eligible to any offices whatever during the period for which they shall be elected to serve, and even for some time afterwards—and 2. How far they ought to participate in the power of appointments. As to the first, it is true that legislators in foreign countries, or in our state governments, are not generally made ineligible to office: there are good reasons for it; in many countries the people have gone on without ever examining the principles of government. There have been but few countries in [1030]which the legislators have been a particular set of men periodically chosen: but the principal reason is, that which operates in the several states, viz. the legislators are so frequently chosen, and so numerous, compared with the number of offices for which they can reasonably consider themselves as candidates, that the chance of any individual member’s being chosen, is too small to raise his hopes or expectations, or to have any considerable influence upon his conduct. Among the state legislators, one man in twenty may be appointed in some committee business, &c. for a month or two; but on a fair computation, not one man in a hundred sent to the state legislatures is appointed to any permanent office of profit: directly the reverse of this will evidently be found true in the federal administration. Throughout the United States, about four federal senators, and thirty-three representatives, averaging the elections, will be chosen in a year; these few men may rationally consider themselves as the fairest candidates for a very great number of lucrative offices, which must become vacant in the year, and pretty clearly a majority of the federal legislators, if not excluded, will be mere expectants for public offices. I need not adduce further arguments to establish a position so clear; I need only call to your recollection my observations in a former letter, wherein I endeavoured to shew the fallacy of the argument, that the members must return home and mix with the people.32 It is said, that men are governed by interested motives, and will not attend as legislators, unless they can, in common with others, be eligible to offices of honor and profit. This will undoubtedly be the case with some men, but I presume only with such men as never ought to be chosen legislators in a free country; an opposite principle will influence good men; virtuous patriots, and generous minds, will esteem it a higher honor to be selected as the guardians of a free people; they will be satisfied with a reasonable compensation for their time and service; nor will they wish to be within the vortex of influence. The valuable effects of this principle of making legislators ineligible to offices for a given time, has never yet been sufficiently attended to or considered: I am assured, that it was established by the convention after long debate, and afterwards, on an unfortunate change of a few members, altered.33 Could the federal legislators be excluded in the manner proposed, I think it would be an important point gained; as to themselves, they would be left to act much more from motives consistent with the public good. In considering the principle of rotation I had occasion to distinguish the condition of a legislator from that of mere official man34—We acquire certain habits, feelings, and opinions, as men and citizens—others, and very different ones, from a long continuance in office: It is, therefore, a valuable observation in many bills of rights, that rulers [1031]ought frequently to return and mix with the people. A legislature, in a free country, must be numerous; it is in some degree a periodical assemblage of the people, frequently formed—the principal officers in the executive and judicial departments, must have more permanency in office. Hence it may be inferred, that the legislature will remain longer uncorrupted and virtuous; longer congenial to the people, than the officers of those departments. If it is not, therefore, in our power to preserve republican principles, for a series of ages, in all the departments of government, we may a long while preserve them in a well formed legislature. To this end we ought to take every precaution to prevent legislators becoming mere office-men; chuse them frequently, make them recallable, establish rotation among them, make them ineligible to offices, and give them as small a share as possible in the disposal of them. Add to this, a legislature, in the nature of things, is not formed for the detail business of appointing officers; there is also generally an impropriety in the same men’s making offices and filling them, and a still greater impropriety in their impeaching and trying the officers they appoint. For these, and other reasons, I conclude, the legislature is not a proper body for the appointment of officers in general. But having gone through with the different modes of appointment, I shall endeavour to shew what share in the distribution of the power of appointments the legislature must, from necessity, rather than from propriety, take. 2. Officers may be appointed by the president and senate—this mode, for general purposes, is clearly not defensible. All the reasoning touching the legislature will apply to the senate; the senate is a branch of the legislature, which ought to be kept pure and unbiassed; it has a part in trying officers for misconduct, and in creating offices, it is too numerous for a council of appointment, or to feel any degree of responsibility: if it has an advantage of the legislature, in being the least numerous, it has a disadvantage in being more unsafe: add to this, the senate is to have a share in the important branch of power respecting treaties. Further, this sexennial senate of 26 members, representing 13 sovereign states, will not, in practice, be found to be a body to advise, but to order and dictate in fact; and the president will be a mere primus inter pares.35 The consequence will be, that the senate, with these efficient means of influence, will not only dictate, probably, to the president, but manage the house, as the constitution now stands; and under appearances of a balanced system, in reality, govern alone. There may also, by this undue connection, be particular periods when a very popular president may have a very improper influence upon the senate and upon the legislature. A council of appointment must very probably sit all, or near all, the year—the senate will be too important and too expensive a body for this. By giving the [1032]senate, directly or indirectly, an undue influence over the representatives, and the improper means of fettering, embarrassing, or controuling the president or executive, we give the government, in the very out set, a fatal and pernicious tendency to that middle undesirable point—aristocracy. When we, as a circumstance not well to be avoided, admit the senate to a share of power in making treaties, and in managing foreign concerns, we certainly progress full far enough towards this most undesirable point in government. For with this power, also, I believe, we must join that of appointing ambassadors, other foreign ministers, and consuls, being powers necessarily connected.—In every point of view, in which I can contemplate this subject, it appears extremely clear to me, that the senate ought not generally to be a council of appointment. The legislature, after the people, is the great fountain of power, and ought to be kept as pure and uncorrupt as possible, from the hankerings, biasses, and contagion of offices—then the streams issuing from it, will be less tainted with those evils. It is not merely the number of impeachments, that are to be expected to make public officers honest and attentive in their business. A general opinion must pervade the community, that the house, the body to impeach them for misconduct, is disinterested, and ever watchful for the public good; and that the judges who shall try impeachments, will not feel a shadow of biass. Under such circumstances, men will not dare transgress, who, not deterred by such accusers and judges, would repeatedly misbehave. We have already suffered many and extensive evils, owing to the defects of the confederation, in not providing against the misconduct of public officers. When we expect the law to be punctually executed, not one man in ten thousand will disobey it: it is the probable chance of escaping punishment that induces men to transgress. It is one important mean to make the government just and honest, rigidly and constantly to hold, before the eyes of those who execute it, punishment, and dismission from office, for misconduct. These are principles no candid man, who has just ideas of the essential features of a free government, will controvert. They are, to be sure, at this period, called visionary, speculative and anti-governmental—but in the true stile of courtiers, selfish politicians, and flatterers of despotism—discerning republican men of both parties see their value. They are said to be of no value, by empty boasting advocates for the constitution, who, by their weakness and conduct, in fact, injure its cause much more than most of its opponents. From their high sounding promises, men are led to expect a defence of it, and to have their doubts removed. When a number of long pieces appear, they, instead of the defence, &c. they expected, see nothing but a parade of names—volumes written without ever coming [1033]to the point—cases quoted between which and ours there is not the least similitude—and partial extracts made from histories and governments, merely to serve a purpose. Some of them, like the true admirers of royal and senatorial robes, would fain prove, that nations who have thought like freemen and philosophers about government, and endeavoured to be free, have often been the most miserable: if a single riot, in the course of five hundred years happened in a free country, if a salary, or the interest of a public or private debt was not paid at the moment, they seem to lay more stress upon these triffles (for triffles they are in a free and happy country) than upon the oppressions of despotic government for ages together. <As to the lengthy writer in New-York you mention, I have attentively examined his pieces; he appears to be a candid good-hearted man, to have a good stile, and some plausible ideas; but when we carefully examine his pieces, to see where the strength of them lies; when the mind endeavours to fix on those material parts, which ought to be the essence of all voluminous productions, we do not find them: the writer appears constantly to move on a smooth surface, the part of his work, like the parts of a cob-house, are all equally strong and all equally weak, and all like those works of the boys, without an object; his pieces appear to have but little relation to the great question, whether the constitution is fitted to the condition and character of this people or not.>36 But to return—3. Officers may be appointed by the president and an executive council—when we have assigned to the legislature the appointment of a few important officers—to the president and senate the appointment of those concerned in managing foreign affairs—to the state governments the appointment of militia officers, and authorise the legislature, by legislative acts, to assign to the president alone, to the heads of the departments, and courts of law respectively, the appointment of many inferior officers; we shall then want to lodge some where a residuum of power, a power to appoint all other necessary officers, as established by law. The fittest receptacle for this residuary power is clearly, in my opinion, the first executive magistrate, advised and directed by an executive council of seven or nine members, periodically chosen from such proportional districts as the union may for the purpose be divided into. The people may give their votes for twice the number of counsellers wanted, and the federal legislature take twice the number also from the highest candidates, and from among them chuse the seven or nine, or number wanted. Such a council may be rationally formed for the business of appointments; whereas the senate, created for other purposes, never can be—Such councils form a feature in some of the best executives [1034]in the union—they appear to be essential to every first magistrate, who may frequently want advice. To authorise the president to appoint his own council would be unsafe: to give the sole appointment of it to the legislature, would confer an undue and unnecessary influence upon that branch. Such a council for a year would be less expensive than the senate for four months. The president may nominate, and the counsellers always be made responsible for their advice and opinions, by recording and signing whatever they advise to be done. They and the president, to many purposes, will properly form an independent executive branch; have an influence unmixed with the legislative, which the executive never can have while connected with a powerful branch of the legislature. And yet the influence arising from the power of appointments be less dangerous, because in less dangerous hands—hands properly adequate to possess it. Whereas the senate, from its character and situation will add a dangerous weight to the power itself, and be far less capable of responsibility, than the council proposed. There is another advantage; the residuum of power, as to appointments, which the president and council need possess, is less than that the president and senate must have. And as such a council would render the sessions of the senate unnecessary many months in the year, the expences of the government would not be increased, if they would not be lessened by the institution of such a council. I think I need not dwell upon this article, as the fitness of this mode of appointment will perhaps amply appear by the evident unfitness of the others. 4. Officers may be appointed by the president alone. It has been almost universally found, when a man has been authorized to exercise power alone, he has never done it alone; but, generally, aided his determinations by, and rested on the advice and opinions of others. And it often happens when advice is wanted, the worst men, the most interested creatures, the worst advice is at hand, obtrude themselves, and misdirect the mind of him who would be informed and advised. It is very seldom we see a single executive depend on accidental advice and assistance; but each single executive has, almost always, formed to itself a regular council, to be assembled and consulted on important occasions; this proves that a select council, of some kind, is, by experience, generally found necessary and useful. But in a free country, the exercise of any considerable branch of power ought to be under some checks and controuls. As to this point, I think the constitution stands well, the legislature may, when it shall deem it expedient, from time to time, authorise the president alone to appoint particular inferior officers, and when necessary to take back the power. His power, therefore, in this respect, may always be increased or decreased by the legislature, [1035]as experience, the best instructor, shall direct: always keeping him, by the constitution, within certain bounds. LETTER XIV. January 17, 1788. Dear Sir, To continue the subject of appointments:—Officers, in the fifth place, may be appointed by the heads of departments or courts of law. Art. 2. sect. 2. respecting appointments, goes on—“But congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.” The probability is, as the constitution now stands, that the senate, a branch of the legislature, will be tenacious of the power of appointment, and much too sparingly part with a share of it to the courts of law, and heads of departments. Here again the impropriety appears of the senate’s having, generally, a share in the appointment of officers. We may fairly presume, that the judges, and principal officers in the departments, will be able well informed men in their respective branches of business; that they will, from experience, be best informed as to proper persons to fill inferior offices in them; that they will feel themselves responsible for the execution of their several branches of business, and for the conduct of the officers they may appoint therein.—From these, and other considerations, I think we may infer, that impartial and judicious appointments of subordinate officers will, generally, be made by the courts of law, and the heads of departments. This power of distributing appointments, as circumstances may require, into several hands, in a well formed disinterested legislature, might be of essential service, not only in promoting beneficial appointments, but, also, in preserving the balance in government: a feeble executive may be strengthened and supported by placing in its hands more numerous appointments; an executive too influential may be reduced within proper bounds, by placing many of the inferior appointments in the courts of law, and heads of departments; nor is there much danger that the executive will be wantonly weakened or strengthened by the legislature, by thus shifting the appointments of inferior officers, since all must be done by legislative acts, which cannot be passed without the consent of the executive, or the consent of two thirds of both branches—a good legislature will use this power to preserve the balance and perpetuate the government. Here again we are brought to our ultimatum:—is the legislature so constructed as to deserve our confidence? 6. Officers may be appointed by the state governments. By art. 1. sect. 8. the respective states are authorised exclusively to appoint the militia-officers. This not only lodges the appointments in proper places, [1036]but it also tends to distribute and lodge in different executive hands the powers of appointing to offices, so dangerous when collected into the hands of one or a few men. It is a good general rule, that the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, ought to be kept distinct; but this, like other general rules, has its exceptions; and without these exceptions we cannot form a good government, and properly balance its parts: and we can determine only from reason, experience, and a critical inspection of the parts of the government, how far it is proper to intermix those powers. Appointments, I believe, in all mixed governments, have been assigned to different hands—some are made by the executive, some by the legislature, some by the judges, and some by the people. It has been thought adviseable by the wisest nations, that the legislature should so far exercise executive and judicial powers as to appoint some officers, judge of the elections of its members, and impeach and try officers for misconduct—that the executive should have a partial share in legislation—that judges should appoint some subordinate officers, and regulate so far as to establish rules for their own proceedings. Where the members of the government, as the house, the senate, the executive, and judiciary, are strong and complete, each in itself, the balance is naturally produced, each party may take the powers congenial to it, and we have less need to be anxious about checks, and the subdivision of powers. If after making the deductions, already alluded to, from the general power to appoint federal officers the residuum shall be thought to be too large and unsafe, and to place an undue influence in the hands of the president and council, a further deduction may be made, with many advantages, and, perhaps, with but a few inconveniencies; and that is, by giving the appointment of a few great officers to the legislature—as of the commissioners of the treasury—of the comptroller, treasurer, master coiner, and some of the principal officers in the money department—of the sheriffs or marshalls of the United States—of states attornies, secretary of the home department, and secretary at war, perhaps, of the judges of the supreme court—of major-generals and admirals. The appointments of these officers, who may be at the heads of the great departments of business, in carrying into execution the national system, involve in them a variety of considerations; they will not often occur and the power to make them ought to remain in safe hands. Officers of the above description are appointed by the legislatures in some of the states, and in some not. We may, I believe, presume that the federal legislature will possess sufficient knowledge and discernment to make judicious appointments: however, as these appointments by the legislature tend to increase a mixture of power, to lessen [1037]the advantages of impeachments and responsibility, I would by no means contend for them any further than it may be necessary for reducing the power of the executive within the bounds of safety. To determine, with propriety, how extensive power the executive ought to possess relative to appointments, we must also examine the forms of it, and its other powers; and these forms and other powers I shall now proceed briefly to examine. By art. 2. sect. 1. the executive power shall be vested in a president elected for four years, by electors to be appointed from time to time, in such manner as the state legislatures shall direct—the electors to be equal in numbers to the federal senators and representatives: but congress may determine the time of chusing senators [i.e., electors], and the day on which they shall give their votes; and if no president be chosen by the electors, by a majority of votes, the states, as states in congress, shall elect one of the five highest on the list for president. It is to be observed, that in chusing the president, the principle of electing by a majority of votes is adopted; in chusing the vice president, that of electing by a plurality. Viewing the principles and checks established in the election of the president, and especially considering the several states may guard the appointment of the electors as they shall judge best, I confess there appears to be a judicious combination of principles and precautions. Were the electors more numerous than they will be, in case the representation be not increased, I think, the system would be improved; not that I consider the democratic character so important in the choice of the electors as in the choice of representatives: be the electors more or less democratic, the president will be one of the very few of the most elevated characters. But there is danger, that a majority of a small number of electors may be corrupted and influenced, after appointed electors, and before they give their votes, especially if a considerable space of time elapse between the appointment and voting. I have already considered the advisory council in the executive branch: there are two things further in the organization of the executive, to which I would particularly draw your attention; the first, which, is a single executive. I confess, I approve; the second, by which any person from period to period may be re-elected president, I think very exceptionable. Each state in the union has uniformly shewn its preference for a single executive, and generally directed the first executive magistrate to act in certain cases by the advice of an executive council. Reason, and the experience of enlightened nations, seem justly to assign the business of making laws to numerous assemblies; and the execution of them, principally, to the direction and care of one man. Independent [1038]of practice a single man seems to be peculiarly well circumstanced to superintend the execution of laws with discernment and decision, with promptitude and un[i]formity: the people usually point out a first man—he is to be seen in civilized as well as uncivilized nations—in republics as well as in other governments. In every large collection of people there must be a visible point serving as a common centre in the government, towards which to draw their eyes and attachments. The constitution must fix a man, or a congress of men, superior in the opinion of the people, to the most popular men in the different parts of the community, else the people will be apt to divide and follow their respective leaders. Aspiring men, armies and navies, have not often been kept in tolerable order by the decrees of a senate or an executive council. The advocates for lodging the executive power in the hands of a number of equals, as an executive council, say, that much wisdom may be collected in such a council, and that it will be safe; but they agree, that it cannot be so prompt and responsible as a single man—they admit that such a council will generally consist of the aristocracy, and not stand so indifferent between it and the people as a first magistrate. But the principal objection made to a single man is, that when possessed of power he will be constantly struggling for more, disturbing the government, and encroaching on the rights of others. It must be admitted, that men, from the monarch down to the porter, are constantly aiming at power and importance and this propensity must be as constantly guarded against in the forms of the government. Adequate powers must be delegated to those who govern, and our security must be in limiting, defining, and guarding the exercise of them, so that those given shall not be abused, or made use of for openly or secretly seizing more. Why do we believe this abuse of power peculiar to a first magistrate? Is it because in the wars and contests of men, one man has often established his power over the rest? Or are men naturally fond of accumulating powers in the hands of one man? I do not see any similitude between the cases of those tyrants, who have sprung up in the midst of wars and tumults, and the cases of limited executives in established governments; nor shall we, on a careful examination, discover much likeness between the executives in Sweden, Denmark, Holland, &c. which have, from time to time, increased their powers, and become more absolute, and the executives, whose powers are well ascertained and defined, and which remain, by the constitution, only for a short and limited period in the hands of any one man or family. A single man, or family, can long and effectually direct its exertions to one point. There may be many favourable opportunities in the course of a man’s life to seize on additional powers, and many more where [1039]powers are hereditary; and there are many circumstances favourable to usurpations, where the powers of the man or family are undefined, and such as often may be unduly extended before the people discover it. If we examine history attentively, we shall find that such exertions, such opportunities, and such circumstances as these have attended all the executives which have usurped upon the rights of the people, and which appear originally to have been, in some degree, limited. Admitting that moderate and even well defined powers, long in the hands of the same man or family, will, probably, be unreasonably increased, it will not follow that even extensive powers placed in the hands of a man only for a few years will be abused. The Roman consuls and Carthagenian suffetes possessed extensive powers while in office; but being annually appointed, they but seldom, if ever, abused them. The Roman dictators often possessed absolute power while in office; but usually being elected for short periods of time, no one of them for ages usurped upon the rights of the people. The kings of France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, &c. have become absolute merely from the encroachments and abuse of power made by the nobles. As to kings, and limited monarchs, generally, history furnishes many more instances in which their powers have been abridged or annihilated by the nobles or people, or both, than in which they have been increased or made absolute; and in almost all the latter cases, we find the people were inattentive and fickle, and evidently were not born to be free. I am the more particular respecting this subject, because I have heard many mistaken observations relative to it. Men of property, and even men who hold powers for themselves and posterity, have too much to lose, wantonly to hazard a shock of the political system; the game must be large, and the chance of winning great, to induce them to risque what they have, for the uncertain prospect of gaining more. Our executive may be altogether elective, and possess no power, but as the substitute of the people, and that well limited, and only for a limited time. The great object is, in a republican government, to guard effectually against perpetuating any portion of power, great or small, in the same man or family; this perpetuation of power is totally uncongenial to the true spirit of republican governments: on the one hand the first executive magistrate ought to remain in office so long as to avoid instability in the execution of the laws; on the other, not so long as to enable him to take any measures to establish himself. The convention, it seems, first agreed that the president should be chosen for seven years, and never after to be eligible.37 Whether seven years is a period too long or not, is rather matter of opinion; but clear it is, that this mode is infinitely preferable to the one finally adopted. When a man shall get the [1040]chair, who may be re-elected, from time to time, for life, his greatest object will be to keep it; to gain friends and votes, at any rate; to associate some favourite son with himself, to take the office after him: whenever he shall have any prospect of continuing the office in himself and family, he will spare no artifice, no address, and no exertions, to increase the powers and importance of it; the servile supporters of his wishes will be placed in all offices, and tools constantly employed to aid his views and sound his praise. A man so situated will have no permanent interest in the government to lose, by contests and convulsions in the state, but always much to gain, and frequently the seducing and flattering hope of succeeding. If we reason at all on the subject, we must irresistably conclude, that this will be the case with nine tenths of the presidents; we may have, for the first president, and, perhaps, one in a century or two afterwards (if the government should withstand the attacks of others) a great and good man,38 governed by superior motives; but these are not events to be calculated upon in the present state of human nature. A man chosen to this important office for a limited period, and always afterwards rendered, by the constitution, ineligible, will be governed by very different considerations: he can have no rational hopes or expectations of retaining his office after the expiration of a known limited time, or of continuing the office in his family, as by the constitution there must be a constant transfer of it from one man to another, and consequently from one family to another. No man will wish to be a mere cypher at the head of the government: the great object of each president then will be, to render his government a glorious period in the annals of his country. When a man constitutionally retires from office, he retires without pain; he is sensible he retires because the laws direct it, and not from the success of his rivals, nor with that public disapprobation which being left out, when eligible, implies. It is said, that a man knowing that at a given period he must quit his office, will unjustly attempt to take from the public, and lay in store the means of support and splendour in his retirement; there can, I think, be but very little in this observation. The same constitution that makes a man eligible for a given period only, ought to make no man eligible till he arrive to the age of forty or forty-five years: if he be a man of fortune, he will retire with dignity to his estate; if not, he may, like the Roman consuls, and other eminent characters in republics, find an honorable support and employment in some respectable office. A man who must, at all events, thus leave his office, will have but few or no temptations to fill its dependant offices with his tools, or any particular set of men; [1041]whereas the man constantly looking forward to his future elections, and, perhaps, to the aggrandizement of his family, will have every inducement before him to fill all places with his own props and dependants. As to public monies, the president need handle none of them, and he may always rigidly be made [to] account for every shilling he shall receive. On the whole, it would be, in my opinion, almost as well to create a limited monarchy at once, and give some family permanent power and interest in the community, and let it have something valuable to itself to lose in convulsions in the state, and in attempts of usurpation, as to make a first magistrate eligible for life, and to create hopes and expectations in him and his family, of obtaining what they have not. In the latter case, we actually tempt them to disturb the state, to foment struggles and contests, by laying before them the flattering prospect of gaining much in them without risking any thing. The constitution provides only that the president shall hold his office during the term of four years; that, at most, only implies, that one shall be chosen every fourth year; it also provides, that in case of the removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the president and vice-president, congress may declare what officer shall act as president; and that such officers shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected: it also provides that congress may determine the time of chusing electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes. Considering these clauses together, I submit this question—whether in case of a vacancy in the office of president, by the removal, death, resignation, or inability of the president and vice-president, and congress should declare, that a certain officer, as secretary for foreign affairs, for instance, shall act as president, and suffer such officer to continue several years, or even for his life, to act as president, by omitting to appoint the time for chusing electors of another president, it would be any breach of the constitution? This appears to me to be an intended provision for supplying the office of president, not only for any remaining portion of the four years, but in cases of emergency, until another president shall be elected; and that at a period beyond the expiration of the four years: we do not know that it is impossible; we do not know that it is improbable, in case a popular officer should thus be declared the acting president, but that he might continue for life, and without any violent act, but merely by neglects and delays on the part of congress. I shall conclude my observations on the organization of the legislature and executive, with making some remarks, rather as a matter of [1042]amusement, on the branch, or partial negative, in the legislation:—The third branch in the legislature may answer three valuable purposes, to impede in their passage hasty and intemperate laws, occasionally to assist the senate or people, and to prevent the legislature from encroaching upon the executive or judiciary. In Great Britain the king has a complete negative upon all laws, but he very seldom exercises it. This may be well lodged in him, who possesses strength to support it, and whose family has independent and hereditary interests and powers, rights and prerogatives, in the government, to defend: but in a country where the first executive officer is elective, and has no rights, but in common with the people, a partial negative in legislation, as in Massachusetts and New-York, is, in my opinion, clearly best: in the former state, as before observed, it is lodged in the governor alone; in the latter, in the governor, chancellor, and judges of the supreme court—the new constitution lodges it in the president. This is simply a branch of legislative power, and has in itself no relation to executive or judicial powers. The question is, in what hands ought it to be lodged, to answer the three purposes mentioned the most advantageously? The prevailing opinion seems to be in favour of vesting it in the hands of the first executive magistrate. I will not say this opinion is ill founded. The negative, in one case, is intended to prevent hasty laws, not supported and revised by two-thirds of each of the two branches; in the second, it is to aid the weaker branch; and in the third, to defend the executive and judiciary. To answer these ends, there ought, therefore, to be collected in the hands which hold this negative, firmness, wisdom, and strength; the very object of the negative is occasional opposition to the two branches. By lodging it in the executive magistrate, we give him a share in making the laws, which he must execute; by associating the judges with him, as in New-York, we give them a share in making the laws, upon which they must decide as judicial magistrates; this may be a reason for excluding the judges: however, the negative in New-York is certainly well calculated to answer its great purposes: the governor and judges united must possess more firmness and strength, more wisdom and information, than either alone, and also more of the confidence of the people; and as to the balance among the departments, why should the executive alone hold the scales, and the judicial be left defenceless? I think the negative in New-York is found best in practice; we see it there frequently and wisely put upon the measures of the two branches; whereas in Massachusetts it is hardly ever exercised, and the governor, I believe, has often permitted laws to pass to which he had substantial objections, but did not make them; he, however, it is to be observed, is annually elected. [1043 LETTER XV. January 18, 1788. Dear Sir, Before I proceed to examine particularly the powers vested, or which ought to be, vested in each branch of the proposed government, I shall briefly examine the organization of the remaining branch, the judicial, referring the particular examining of its powers to some future letters.39 In forming this branch, our objects are—a fair and open, a wise and impartial interpretation of the laws—a prompt and impartial administration of justice, between the public and individuals, and between man and man. I believe, there is no feature in a free government more difficult to be well formed than this, especially in an extensive country, where the courts must be numerous, or the citizens travel to obtain justice. The confederation impowers congress to institute judicial courts in four cases. 1. For settling disputes between individual states. 2. For determining, finally, appeals in all cases of captures. 3. For the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas: And, 4. For the administration of martial law in the army and navy. The state courts in all other cases possess the judicial powers, in all questions arising on the laws of nations, of the union, and of the states individually—nor does congress appear to have any controul over state courts, judges or officers. The business of the judicial department is, properly speaking, judicial in part, in part executive, done by judges and juries, by certain recording and executive officers, as clerks, sheriffs, &c. they are all properly limbs, or parts, of the judicial courts, and have it in charge, faithfully to decide upon, and execute the laws, in judicial cases, between the public and individuals, between man and man. The recording and executive officers, in this department, may well enough be formed by legislative acts, from time to time: but the offices, the situation, the powers and duties of judges and juries, are too important, as they respect the political system, as well as the administration of justice, not to be fixed on general principles by the constitution. It is true, the laws are made by the legislature; but the judges and juries, in their interpretations, and in directing the execution of them, have a very extensive influence for preserving or destroying liberty, and for changing the nature of the government. It is an observation of an approved writer, that judicial power is of such a nature, that when we have ascertained and fixed its limits, with all the caution and precision we can, it will yet be formidable, somewhat arbitrary and despotic—that is, after all our cares, we must leave a vast deal to the discretion and interpretation—to the wisdom, integrity, and politics of the [1044]judges40—These men, such is the state even of the best laws, may do wrong, perhaps, in a thousand cases, sometimes with, and sometimes without design, yet it may be impracticable to convict them of misconduct. These considerations shew, how cautious a free people ought to be in forming this, as well as the other branches of their government, especially when connected with other considerations equally deserving of notice and attention. When the legislature makes a bad law, or the first executive magistrate usurps upon the rights of the people, they discover the evil much sooner, than the abuses of power in the judicial department; the proceedings of which are far more intricate, complex, and out of their immediate view. A bad law immediately excites a general alarm; a bad judicial determination, though not less pernicious in its consequences, is immediately felt, probably, by a single individual only, and noticed only by his neighbours, and a few spectators in the court. In this country, we have been always jealous of the legislature, and especially the executive; but not always of the judiciary: but very few men attentively consider the essential parts of it, and its proceedings, as they tend to support or to destroy free government: only a few professional men are in a situation properly to do this; and it is often alledged, that instances have not frequently occurred, in which they have been found very alert watchmen in the cause of liberty, or in the cause of democratic republics. Add to these considerations, that particular circumstances exist at this time to increase our inattention to limiting properly the judicial powers, we may fairly conclude, we are more in danger of sowing the seeds of arbitrary government in this department than in any other. In the unsettled state of things in this country, for several years past, it has been thought, that our popular legislatures have, sometimes, departed from the line of strict justice, while the law courts have shewn a disposition more punctually to keep to it. We are not sufficiently attentive to the circumstances, that the measures of popular legislatures naturally settle down in time, and gradually approach a mild and just medium; while the rigid systems of the law courts naturally become more severe and arbitrary, if not carefully tempered and guarded by the constitution, and by laws, from time to time. It is true, much has been written and said about some of these courts lately, in some of the states; but all has been about their fees, &c. and but very little to the purposes, as to their influence upon the freedom of the government. By art. 3. sect. 1. the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts, as congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish—the judges of them to [1045]hold their offices during good behaviour, and to receive, at stated times, a compensation for their services, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office; but which, I conceive, may be increased. By the same art. sect. 2. the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction, “in all cases affecting ambassadors, and other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, and appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all other federal causes, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the congress shall make.” By the same section, the judicial power shall extend in law and equity to all the federal cases therein enumerated. By the same section the jury trial, in criminal causes, except in cases of impeachment, is established; but not in civil causes, and the whole state may be considered as the vicinage in cases of crimes. These clauses present to view the constitutional features of the federal judiciary: this has been called a monster by some of the opponents, and some, even of the able advocates, have confessed they do not comprehend it. For myself, I confess, I see some good things in it, and some very extraordinary ones. “There shall be one supreme court.” There ought in every government to be one court, in which all great questions in law shall finally meet and be determined: in Great-Britain, this is the house of lords, aided by all the superior judges; in Massachusetts, it is, at present, the supreme judicial court, consisting of five judges; in New-York, by the constitution, it is a court consisting of the president of the senate, the senators, chancellor and judges of the supreme court; and in the United States the federal supreme court, or this court in the last resort, may, by the legislature, be made to consist of three, five, fifty, or any other number of judges. The inferior federal courts are left by the constitution to be instituted and regulated altogether as the legislature shall judge best; and it is well provided, that the judges shall hold their offices during good behaviour. I shall not object to the line drawn between the original and appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court; though should we for safety, &c. be obliged to form a numerous supreme court, and place in it a considerable number of respectable characters, it will be found inconvenient for such a court, originally, to try all the causes affecting ambassadors, consuls, &c. Appeals may be carried up to the supreme court, under such regulations as congress shall make. Thus far the legislature does not appear to be limited to improper rules or principles in instituting judicial courts: indeed the legislature will have full power to form and arrange judicial courts in the federal cases enumerated, at pleasure, with these eight exceptions only. 1. There can be but one supreme federal judicial court. 2. This [1046]must have jurisdiction as to law and fact in the appellate causes. 3. Original jurisdiction, when foreign ministers and the states are concerned. 4. The judges of the judicial courts must continue in office during good behaviour—and, 5. Their salaries cannot be diminished while in office. 6. There must be a jury trial in criminal causes. 7. The trial of crimes must be in the state where committed—and, 8. There must be two witnesses to convict of treason. In all other respects Congress may organize the judicial department according to their discretion; the importance of this power, among others proposed by the legislature (perhaps necessarily) I shall consider hereafter. Though there must, by the constitution, be but one judicial court, in which all the rays of judicial powers as to law, equity, and fact, in the cases enumerated must meet; yet this may be made by the legislature, a special court, consisting of any number of respectable characters or officers, the federal legislators excepted, to superintend the judicial department, to try the few causes in which foreign ministers and the states may be concerned, and to correct errors, as to law and fact, in certain important causes on appeals. Next below this judicial head, there may be several courts, such as are usually called superior courts, as a court of chancery, a court of criminal jurisdiction, a court of civil jurisdiction, a court of admiralty jurisdiction, a court of exchequer, &c. giving an appeal from these respectively to the supreme judicial court. These superior courts may be considered as so many points to which appeals may be brought up, from the various inferior courts, in the several branches of judicial causes. In all these superior and inferior courts, the trial by jury may be established in all cases, and the law and equity properly separated. In this organization, only a few very important causes, probably, would be carried up to the supreme court.—The superior courts would, finally, settle almost all causes. This organization, so far as it would respect questions of law, inferior, superior, and a special supreme court, would resemble that of New-York in a considerable degree, and those of several other states. This, I imagine, we must adopt, or else the Massachusetts plan; that is, a number of inferior courts, and one superior or supreme court, consisting of three, or five, or seven judges, in which one supreme court all the business shall be immediately collected from the inferior ones. The decision of the inferior courts, on either plan, probably will not much be relied on; and on the latter plan, there must be a prodigious accumulation of powers and business in all cases touching law, equity and facts, and all kinds of causes in a few hands, for whose errors of ignorance or design, there will be no possible remedy. As the legislature may adopt either of these, or any other plan, I shall not dwell longer on this subject. In examining the federal judiciary, there appears to be some things very extraordinary and very peculiar. The judges or their friends may seize every opportunity to raise the judges salaries; but by the constitution they cannot be diminished. I am sensible how important it is that judges shall always have adequate and certain support; I am against their depending upon annual or periodical grants, because these may be withheld, or rendered too small by the dissent or narrowness of any one branch of the legislature; but there is a material distinction between periodical grants, and salaries held under permanent and standing laws: the former at stated periods cease, and must be renewed by the consent of all and every part of the legislature; the latter continue of course, and never will cease or be lowered, unless all parts of the legislature agree to do it. A man has as permanent an interest in his salary fixed by a standing law, so long as he may remain in office, as in any property he may possess; for the laws regulating the tenure of all property, are always liable to be altered by the legislature. The same judge may frequently be in office thirty or forty years; there may often be times, as in cases of war, or very high prices, when his salary may reasonably be increased one half or more; in a few years money may become scarce again, and prices fall, and his salary, with equal reason and propriety be decreased and lowered: not to suffer this to be done by consent of all the branches of the legislature, is, I believe, quite a novelty in the affairs of government. It is true, by a very forced and unnatural construction, the constitution of Massachusetts, by the governor and minority in the legislature, was made to speak this kind of language. Another circumstance ought to be considered; the mines which have been discovered are gradually exhausted, and the precious metals are continually wasting: hence the probability is, that money, the nominal representative of property, will gradually grow scarcer hereafter, and afford just reasons for gradually lowering salaries. The value of money depends altogether upon the quantity of it in circulation, which may be also decreased, as well as encreased, from a great variety of causes. The supreme court, in cases of appeals, shall have jurisdiction both as to law and fact: that is, in all civil causes carried up [to] the supreme court by appeals, the court, or judges, shall try the fact and decide the law. Here an essential principle of the civil law is established, and the most noble and important principle of the common law exploded. To dwell a few minutes on this material point: the supreme court shall have jurisdiction both as to law and fact. What is meant by court? Is the jury included in the term, or is it not? I conceive it is not included: and so the members of convention, I am very sure, understand it. [1048]Court, or curia, was a term well understood long before juries existed; the people, and the best writers, in countries where there are no juries, uniformly use the word court, and can only mean by it the judge or judges who determine causes: also, in countries where there are juries we express ourselves in the same manner; we speak of the court of probate, court of chancery, justices court, alderman’s court, &c. in which there is no jury. In our supreme courts, common pleas, &c. in which there are jury trials, we uniformly speak of the court and jury, and consider them as distinct. Were it necessary I might site a multitude of cases from law books to confirm, beyond controversy, this position, that the jury is not included, or a part of the court. But the supreme court is to have jurisdiction as to law and fact, under such regulations as congress shall make. I confess it is impossible to say how far congress may, with propriety, extend their regulations in this respect. I conceive, however, they cannot by any reasonable construction go so far as to admit the jury, on true common law principles, to try the fact, and give a general verdict. I have repeatedly examined this article: I think the meaning of it is, that the judges in all final questions, as to property and damages, shall have complete jurisdiction, to consider the whole cause, to examine the facts, and on a general view of them, and on principles of equity, as well as law, to give judgment. As the trial by jury is provided for in criminal causes, I shall confine my observations to civil causes—and in these, I hold it is the established right of the jury by the common law, and the fundamental laws of this country, to give a general verdict in all cases when they chuse to do it, to decide both as to law and fact, whenever blended together in the issue put to them. Their right to determine as to facts will not be disputed, and their right to give a general verdict has never been disputed, except by a few judges and lawyers, governed by despotic principles. Coke, Hale, Holt, Blackstone, De Lome, and almost every other legal or political writer, who has written on the subject, has uniformly asserted this essential and important right of the jury. Juries in Great-Britain and America have universally practised accordingly. Even Mansfield, with all his wishes about him, dare not directly avow the contrary. What fully confirms this point is, that there is no instance to be found, where a jury was ever punished for finding a general verdict, when a special one might, with propriety, have been found. The jury trial, especially politically considered, is by far the most important feature in the judicial department in a free country, and the right in question is far the most valuable part, and the last that ought to be yielded, of this trial. Juries are constantly and frequently drawn from the body of the people, and freemen of the country; and by holding the jury’s right to [1049]return a general verdict in all cases sacred, we secure to the people at large, their just and rightful controul in the judicial department. If the conduct of judges shall be severe and arbitrary, and tend to subvert the laws, and change the forms of government, the jury may check them, by deciding against their opinions and determinations, in similar cases. It is true, the freemen of a country are not always minutely skilled in the laws, but they have common sense in its purity, which seldom or never errs in making and applying laws to the condition of the people, or in determining judicial causes, when stated to them by the parties. The body of the people, principally, bear the burdens of the community; they of right ought to have a controul in its important concerns, both in making and executing the laws, otherwise they may, in a short time, be ruined. Nor is it merely this controul alone we are to attend to; the jury trial brings with it an open and public discussion of all causes, and excludes secret and arbitrary proceedings. This, and the democratic branch in the legislature, as was formerly observed, are the means by which the people are let into the knowledge of public affairs—are enabled to stand as the guardians of each others rights, and to restrain, by regular and legal measures, those who otherwise might infringe upon them. I am not unsupported in my opinion of the value of the trial by jury; not only British and American writers, but De Lome, and the most approved foreign writers, hold it to be the most valuable part of the British constitution, and indisputably the best mode of trial ever invented.41 It was merely by the intrigues of the popish clergy, and of the Norman lawyers, that this mode of trial was not used in maritime, ecclesiastical, and military courts, and the civil law proceedings were introduced; and, I believe, it is more from custom and prejudice, than for any substantial reasons, that we do not in all the states establish the jury in our maritime as well as other courts. In the civil law process the trial by jury is unknown; the consequence is, that a few judges and dependant officers, possess all the power in the judicial department. Instead of the open fair proceedings of the common law, where witnesses are examined in open court, and may be cross examined by the parties concerned—where council is allowed, &c. we see in the civil law process judges alone, who always, long previous to the trial, are known and often corrupted by ministerial influence, or by parties. Judges once influenced, soon become inclined to yield to temptations, and to decree for him who will pay the most for their partiality. It is, therefore, we find in the Roman, and almost all governments, where judges alone possess the judicial powers and try all cases, that bribery has prevailed. This, as well as the forms of the [1050]courts, naturally lead to secret and arbitrary proceedings—to taking evidence secretly—exparte, &c. to perplexing the cause—and to hasty decisions:—but, as to jurors, it is quite impracticable to bribe or influence them by any corrupt means; not only because they are untaught in such affairs, and possess the honest characters of the common freemen of a country; but because it is not, generally, known till the hour the cause comes on for trial, what persons are to form the jury. But it is said, that no words could be found by which the states could agree to establish the jury-trial in civil causes. I can hardly believe men to be serious, who make observations to this effect. The states have all derived judicial proceedings principally from one source, the British system; from the same common source the American lawyers have almost universally drawn their legal information. All the states have agreed to establish the trial by jury, in civil as well as in criminal causes. The several states, in congress, found no difficulty in establishing it in the Western Territory, in the ordinance passed in July 1787.42 We find, that the several states in congress, in establishing government in that territory, agreed, that the inhabitants of it, should always be entitled to the benefit of the trial by jury. Thus, in a few words, the jury trial is established in its full extent; and the convention with as much ease, have established the jury trial in criminal cases. In making a constitution, we are substantially to fix principles.—If in one state, damages on default are assessed by a jury, and in another by the judges—if in one state jurors are drawn out of a box, and in another not—if there be other trifling variations, they can be of no importance in the great question. Further, when we examine the particular practices of the states, in little matters in judicial proceedings, I believe we shall find they differ near as much in criminal processes as in civil ones. Another thing worthy of notice in this place—the convention have used the word equity, and agreed to establish a chancery jurisdiction; about the meaning and extent of which, we all know, the several states disagree much more than about jury trials—in adopting the latter, they have very generally pursued the British plan; but as to the former, we see the states have varied, as their fears and opinions dictated. By the common law, in Great Britain and America, there is no appeal from the verdict of the jury, as to facts, to any judges whatever—the jurisdiction of the jury is complete and final in this; and only errors in law are carried up to the house of lords, the special supreme court in Great Britain; or to the special supreme courts in Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, &c. Thus the juries are left masters as to facts: but, by the proposed constitution, directly the opposite principles is established. An appeal will lay in all appellate causes from the verdict of the jury, even as to mere facts, to the judges of the supreme court. Thus, [1051]in effect, we establish the civil law in this point; for if the jurisdiction of the jury be not final, as to facts, it is of little or no importance. By art. 3. sect. 2. “the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States,” &c. What is here meant by equity? what is equity in a case arising under the constitution? possibly the clause might have the same meaning, were the words “in law and equity,” omitted. Cases in law must differ widely from cases in law and equity. At first view, by thus joining the word equity with the word law, if we mean any thing, we seem to mean to give the judge a discretionary power. The word equity, in Great Britain, has in time acquired a precise meaning—chancery proceedings there are now reduced to system—but this is not the case in the United States. In New-England, the judicial courts have no powers in cases in equity, except those dealt out to them by the legislature, in certain limited portions, by legislative acts. In New-York, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina, powers to decide, in cases of equity, are vested in judges distinct from those who decide in matters of law: and the states generally seem to have carefully avoided giving unlimitedly, to the same judges, powers to decide in cases in law and equity. Perhaps, the clause would have the same meaning were the words, “this constitution,” omitted: there is in it either a careless complex misuse of words, in themselves of extensive signification, or there is some meaning not easy to be comprehended. Suppose a case arising under the constitution—suppose the question judicially moved, whether, by the constitution, congress can suppress a state tax laid on polls, lands, or as an excise duty, which may be supposed to interfere with a federal tax. By the letter of the constitution, congress will appear to have no power to do it: but then the judges may decide the question on principles of equity as well as law. Now, omitting the words, “in law and equity,” they may decide according to the spirit and true meaning of the constitution, as collected from what must appear to have been the intentions of the people when they made it. Therefore, it would seem, that if these words mean any thing, they must have a further meaning: yet I will not suppose it intended to lodge an arbitrary power or discretion in the judges, to decide as their conscience, their opinions, their caprice, or their politics might dictate. Without dwelling on this obscure clause, I will leave it to the examination of others. LETTER XVI. January 20, 1788. Dear Sir, Having gone through with the organization of the government, I shall now proceed to examine more particularly those clauses [1052]which respect its powers. I shall begin with those articles and stipulations which are necessary for accurately ascertaining the extent of powers, and what is given, and for guarding, limiting, and restraining them in their exercise. We often find, these articles and stipulations placed in bills of rights; but they may as well be incorporated in the body of the constitution, as selected and placed by themselves. The constitution, or whole social compact, is but one instrument, no more or less, than a certain number of articles or stipulations agreed to by the people, whether it consists of articles, sections, chapters, bills of rights, or parts of any other denomination, cannot be material. Many needless observations, and idle distinctions, in my opinion, have been made respecting a bill of rights. On the one hand, it seems to be considered as a necessary distinct limb of the constitution, and as containing a certain number of very valuable articles, which are applicable to all societies; and, on the other, as useless, especially in a federal government, possessing only enumerated power—nay, dangerous, as individual rights are numerous, and not easy to be enumerated in a bill of rights, and from articles, or stipulations, securing some of them, it may be inferred, that others not mentioned are surrendered. There appears to me to be general indefinite propositions without much meaning—and the man who first advanced those of the latter description, in the present case, signed the federal constitution, which directly contradicts him.43 The supreme power is undoubtedly in the people, and it is a principle well established in my mind, that they reserve all powers not expressly delegated by them to those who govern; this is as true in forming a state as in forming a federal government. There is no possible distinction but this founded merely in the different modes of proceeding which take place in some cases. In forming a state constitution, under which to manage not only the great but the little concerns of a community: the powers to be possessed by the government are often too numerous to be enumerated; the people to adopt the shortest way often give general powers, indeed all powers, to the government, in some general words, and then, by a particular enumeration, take back, or rather say they however reserve certain rights as sacred, and which no laws shall be made to violate: hence the idea that all powers are given which are not reserved; but in forming a federal constitution, which ex vi termine,44 supposes state governments existing, and which is only to manage a few great national concerns, we often find it easier to enumerate particularly the powers to be delegated to the federal head, than to enumerate particularly the individual rights to be reserved; and the principle will operate in its full force, when we carefully adhere to it. When we particularly enumerate the powers given, we [1053]ought either carefully to enumerate the rights reserved, or be totally silent about them; we must either particularly enumerate both, or else suppose the particular enumeration of the powers given adequately draws the line between them and the rights reserved, particularly to enumerate the former and not the latter, I think most advisable: however, as men appear generally to have their doubts about these silent reservations, we might advantageously enumerate the powers given, and then in general words, according to the mode adopted in the 2d art. of the confederation, declare all powers, rights and privileges, are reserved, which are not explicitly and expressly given up. People, and very wisely too, like to be express and explicit about their essential rights, and not to be forced to claim them on the precarious and unascertained tenure of inferences and general principles, knowing that in any controversy between them and their rulers, concerning those rights, disputes may be endless, and nothing certain:—But admitting, on the general principle, that all rights are reserved of course, which are not expressly surrendered, the people could with sufficient certainty assert their rights on all occasions, and establish them with ease, still there are infinite advantages in particularly enumerating many of the most essential rights reserved in all cases; and as to the less important ones, we may declare in general terms, that all not expressly surrendered are reserved. We do not by declarations change the nature of things, or create new truths, but we give existence, or at least establish in the minds of the people truths and principles which they might never otherwise have thought of, or soon forgot. If a nation means its systems, religious or political, shall have duration, it ought to recognize the leading principles of them in the front page of every family book. What is the usefulness of a truth in theory, unless it exists constantly in the minds of the people, and has their assent:—we discern certain rights, as the freedom of the press, and the trial by jury, &c. which the people of England and of America of course believe to be sacred, and essential to their political happiness, and this belief in them is the result of ideas at first suggested to them by a few able men, and of subsequent experience; while the people of some other countries hear these rights mentioned with the utmost indifference; they think the privilege of existing at the will of a despot much preferable to them. Why this difference amongst beings every way formed alike. The reason of the difference is obvious—it is the effect of education, a series of notions impressed upon the minds of the people by examples, precepts and declarations. When the people of England got together, at the time they formed Magna Charta, they did not consider it sufficient, that they were indisputably entitled to certain natural and unalienable rights, not [1054]depending on silent titles, they, by a declaratory act, expressly recognized them, and explicitly declared to all the world, that they were entitled to enjoy those rights; they made an instrument in writing, and enumerated those they then thought essential, or in danger, and this wise men saw was not sufficient; and therefore, that the people might not forget these rights, and gradually become prepared for arbitrary government, their discerning and honest leaders caused this instrument to be confirmed near forty times, and to be read twice a year in public places, not that it would lose its validity without such confirmations, but to fix the contents of it in the minds of the people, as they successively come upon the stage.—Men, in some countries do not remain free, merely because they are entitled to natural and unalienable rights; men in all countries are entitled to them, not because their ancestors once got together and enumerated them on paper, but because, by repeated negociations and declarations, all parties are brought to realize them, and of course to believe them to be sacred. Were it necessary, I might shew the wisdom of our past conduct, as a people in not merely comforting ourselves that we were entitled to freedom, but in constantly keeping in view, in addresses, bills of rights, in news-papers, &c. the particular principles on which our freedom must always depend. It is not merely in this point of view, that I urge the engrafting in the constitution additional declaratory articles. The distinction, in itself just, that all powers not given are reserved, is in effect destroyed by this very constitution, as I shall particularly demonstrate—and even independent of this, the people, by adopting the constitution, give many general undefined powers to congress, in the constitutional exercise of which, the rights in question may be effected. Gentlemen who oppose a federal bill of rights, or further declaratory articles, seem to view the subject in a very narrow imperfect manner. These have for their objects, not only the enumeration of the rights reserved, but principally to explain the general powers delegated in certain material points, and to restrain those who exercise them by fixed known boundaries. Many explanations and restrictions necessary and useful, would be much less so, were the people at large all well and fully acquainted with the principles and affairs of government. There appears to be in the constitution, a studied brevity, and it may also be probable, that several explanatory articles were omitted from a circumstance very common. What we have long and early understood ourselves in the common concerns of the community, we are apt to suppose is understood by others, and need not be expressed; and it is not unnatural or uncommon for the ablest men most frequently to make this mistake. To make declaratory [1055]articles unnecessary in an instrument of government, two circumstances must exist; the rights reserved must be indisputably so, and in their nature defined; the powers delegated to the government, must be precisely defined by the words that convey them, and clearly be of such extent and nature as that, by no reasonable construction, they can be made to invade the rights and prerogatives intended to be left in the people. The first point urged, is, that all power is reserved not expressly given, that particular enumerated powers only are given, that all others are not given, but reserved, and that it is needless to attempt to restrain congress in the exercise of powers they possess not. This reasoning is logical, but of very little importance in the common affairs of men; but the constitution does not appear to respect it even in any view. To prove this, I might cite several clauses in it. I shall only remark on two or three. By article 1, section 9, “No title of nobility shall be granted by congress.” Was this clause omitted, what power would congress have to make titles of nobility? in what part of the constitution would they find it? The answer must be, that congress would have no such power—that the people, by adopting the constitution, will not part with it. Why then by a negative clause, restrain congress from doing what it would have no power to do? This clause, then, must have no meaning, or imply, that were it omitted, congress would have the power in question, either upon the principle that some general words in the constitution may be so construed as to give it, or on the principle that congress possess the powers not expressly reserved. But this clause was in the confederation, and is said to be introduced into the constitution from very great caution. Even a cautionary provision implies a doubt, at least, that it is necessary; and if so in this case, clearly it is also alike necessary in all similar ones. The fact appears to be, that the people in forming the confederation, and the convention, in this instance, acted, naturally, they did not leave the point to be settled by general principles and logical inferences; but they settle the point in a few words, and all who read them at once understand them. The trial by jury in criminal as well as in civil causes, has long been considered as one of our fundamental rights, and has been repeatedly recognized and confirmed by most of the state conventions. But the constitution expressly establishes this trial in criminal, and wholly omits it in civil causes. The jury trial in criminal causes, and the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, are already as effectually established as any of the fundamental or essential rights of the people in the United States. This being the case, why in adopting a federal constitution do we now establish these, and omit all others, or all others, at least, with [1056]a few exceptions, such as again agreeing there shall be no ex post facto laws, no titles of nobility, &c. We must consider this constitution when adopted as the supreme act of the people, and in construing it hereafter, we and our posterity must strictly adhere to the letter and spirit of it, and in no instance depart from them: in construing the federal constitution, it will be not only impracticable, but improper to refer to the state constitutions. They are entirely distinct instruments and inferior acts: besides, by the people’s now establishing certain fundamental rights, it is strongly implied, that they are of opinion, that they would not otherwise be secured as a part of the federal system, or be regarded in the federal administration as fundamental. Further, these same rights, being established by the state constitutions, and secured to the people, our recognizing them now, implies, that the people thought them insecure by the state establishments, and extinguished or put afloat by the new arrangement of the social system, unless re-established.—Further, the people, thus establishing some few rights, and remaining totally silent about others similarly circumstanced, the implication indubitably is, that they mean to relinquish the latter, or at least feel indifferent about them. Rights, therefore, inferred from general principles of reason, being precarious and hardly ascertainable in the common affairs of society, and the people, in forming a federal constitution, explicitly shewing they conceive these rights to be thus circumstanced, and accordingly proceed to enumerate and establish some of them, the conclusion will be, that they have established all which they esteem valuable and sacred. On every principle, then, the people especially having began, ought to go through enumerating, and establish particularly all the rights of individuals, which can by any possibility come in question in making and executing federal laws. I have already observed upon the excellency and importance of the jury trial in civil as well as in criminal causes, instead of establishing it in criminal causes only; we ought to establish it generally;—instead of the clause of forty or fifty words relative to this subject, why not use the language that has always been used in this country, and say, “the people of the United States shall always be entitled to the trial by jury.” This would shew the people still hold the right sacred, and enjoin it upon congress substantially to preserve the jury trial in all cases, according to the usage and custom of the country. I have observed before, that it is the jury trial we want; the little different appendages and modifications tacked to it in the different states, are no more than a drop in the ocean: the jury trial is a solid uniform feature in a free government; it is the substance we would save, not the little articles of form. Security against expost facto laws, the trial by jury, and the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, are but a part of those inestimable rights the people of the United States are entitled to, even in judicial proceedings, by the course of the common law. These may be secured in general words, as in New-York, the Western Territory, &c. by declaring the people of the United States shall always be entitled to judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law, as used and established in the said states. Perhaps it would be better to enumerate the particular essential rights the people are entitled to in these proceedings, as has been done in many of the states, and as has been done in England. In this case, the people may proceed to declare, that no man shall be held to answer to any offence, till the same be fully described to him; nor to furnish evidence against himself: that, except in the government of the army and navy, no person shall be tried for any offence, whereby he may incur loss of life, or an infamous punishment, until he be first indicted by a grand jury: that every person shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favourable to him, and to meet the witnesses against him face to face: that every person shall be entitled to obtain right and justice freely and without delay: that all persons shall have a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, houses, papers, or possessions; and that all warrants shall be deemed contrary to this right, if the foundation of them be not previously supported by oath, and there be not in them a special designation of persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and that no person shall be exiled or molested in his person or effects, otherwise than by the judgment of his peers, or according to the law of the land. A celebrated writer observes upon this last article, that in itself it may be said to comprehend the whole end of political society.45 These rights are not necessarily reserved, they are established, or enjoyed but in few countries: they are stipulated rights, almost peculiar to British and American laws. In the execution of those laws, individuals, by long custom, by magna charta, bills of rights &c. have become entitled to them. A man, at first, by act of parliament, became entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus—men are entitled to these rights and benefits in the judicial proceedings of our state courts generally: but it will by no means follow, that they will be entitled to them in the federal courts, and have a right to assert them, unless secured and established by the constitution or federal laws. We certainly, in federal processes, might as well claim the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, as to claim trial by a jury—the right to have council—to have witnesses face to face—to be secure against unreasonable search warrants, [1058]&c. was the constitution silent as to the whole of them:—but the establishment of the former, will evince that we could not claim them without it; and the omission of the latter, implies they are relinquished, or deemed of no importance. These are rights and benefits individuals acquire by compact; they must claim them under compacts, or immemorial usage—it is doubtful, at least, whether they can be claimed under immemorial usage in this country; and it is, therefore, we generally claim them under compacts, as charters and constitutions. The people by adopting the federal constitution, give congress general powers to institute a distinct and new judiciary, new courts, and to regulate all proceedings in them, under the eight limitations mentioned in a former letter;46 and the further one, that the benefits of the habeas corpus act shall be enjoyed by individuals. Thus general powers being given to institute courts, and regulate their proceedings, with no provision for securing the rights principally in question, may not congress so exercise those powers, and constitutionally too, as to destroy those rights? clearly, in my opinion, they are not in any degree secured. But, admitting the case is only doubtful, would it not be prudent and wise to secure them and remove all doubts, since all agree the people ought to enjoy these valuable rights, a very few men excepted, who seem to be rather of opinion that there is little or nothing in them? Were it necessary I might add many observations to shew their value and political importance. The constitution will give congress general powers to raise and support armies. General powers carry with them incidental ones, and the means necessary to the end. In the exercise of these powers, is there any provision in the constitution to prevent the quartering of soldiers on the inhabitants? you will answer, there is not. This may sometimes be deemed a necessary measure in the support of armies; on what principle can the people claim the right to be exempt from this burden? they will urge, perhaps, the practice of the country, and the provisions made in some of the state constitutions—they will be answered, that their claim thus to be exempt, is not founded in nature, but only in custom and opinion, or at best, in stipulations in some of the state constitutions, which are local, and inferior in their operation, and can have no controul over the general government—that they had adopted a federal constitution—had noticed several rights, but had been totally silent about this exemption—that they had given general powers relative to the subject, which, in their operation, regularly destroyed the claim. Though it is not to be presumed, that we are in any immediate danger from this quarter, yet it is fit and proper to establish, beyond dispute, those rights which are particularly valuable to individuals, and [1059]essential to the permanency and duration of free government. An excellent writer observes, that the English, always in possession of their freedom, are frequently unmindful of the value of it:47 we, at this period, do not seem to be so well off, having, in some instances abused ours; many of us are quite disposed to barter it away for what we call energy, coercion, and some other terms we use as vaguely as that of liberty—There is often as great a rage for change and novelty in politics, as in amusements and fashions. All parties apparently agree, that the freedom of the press is a fundamental right, and ought not to be restrained by any taxes, duties, or in any manner whatever. Why should not the people, in adopting a federal constitution, declare this, even if there are only doubts about it. But, say the advocates, all powers not given are reserved.—true; but the great question is, are not powers given, in the excercise of which this right may be destroyed? The people’s or the printers claim to a free press, is founded on the fundamental laws, that is, compacts, and state constitutions, made by the people. The people, who can annihilate or alter those constitutions, can annihilate or limit this right. This may be done by giving general powers, as well as by using particular words. No right claimed under a state constitution, will avail against a law of the union, made in pursuance of the federal constitution: therefore the question is, what laws will congress have a right to make by the constitution of the union, and particularly touching the press? By art. 1. sect. 8. congress will have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excise. By this congress will clearly have power to lay and collect all kind of taxes whatever—taxes on houses, lands, polls, industry, merchandize, &c.—taxes on deeds, bonds, and all written instruments—on writs, pleas, and all judicial proceedings, on licences, naval officers papers, &c. on newspapers, advertisements, &c. and to require bonds of the naval officers, clerks, printers, &c. to account for the taxes that may become due on papers that go through their hands. Printing, like all other business, must cease when taxed beyond its profits; and it appears to me, that a power to tax the press at discretion, is a power to destroy or restrain the freedom of it. There may be other powers given, in the exercise of which this freedom may be effected; and certainly it is of too much importance to be left thus liable to be taxed, and constantly to constructions and inferences. A free press is the channel of communication as to mercantile and public affairs; by means of it the people in large countries ascertain each others sentiments; are enabled to unite, and become formidable to those rulers who adopt improper measures. Newspapers may sometimes be the vehicles of abuse, and of many things not true; but these are but small inconveniencies, [1060]in my mind, among many advantages. A celebrated writer, I have several times quoted, speaking in high terms of the English liberties, says, “lastly the key stone was put to the arch, by the final establishment of the freedom of the press.”48 I shall not dwell longer upon the fundamental rights, to some of which I have attended in this letter, for the same reasons that these I have mentioned, ought to be expressly secured, lest in the exercise of general powers given they may be invaded: it is pretty clear, that some other of less importance, or less in danger, might with propriety also be secured. I shall now proceed to examine briefly the powers proposed to be vested in the several branches of the government, and especially the mode of laying and collecting internal taxes. LETTER XVII. January 23, 1788. Dear Sir, I believe the people of the United States are full in the opinion, that a free and mild government can be preserved in their extensive territories, only under the substantial forms of a federal republic. As several of the ablest advocates for the system proposed, have acknowledged this (and I hope the confessions they have published will be preserved and remembered) I shall not take up time to establish this point. A question then arises, how far that system partakes of a federal republic.—I observed in a former letter, that it appears to be the first important step to a consolidation of the states; that its strong tendency is to that point.49 But what do we mean by a federal republic? and what by a consolidated government? To erect a federal republic, we must first make a number of states on republican principles; each state with a government organized for the internal management of its affairs: The states, as such, must unite under a federal head, and delegate to it powers to make and execute laws in certain enumerated cases, under certain restrictions; this head may be a single assembly, like the present congress, or the Amphictionic council; or it may consist of a legislature, with one or more branches; of an executive, and of a judiciary. To form a consolidated, or one entire government, there must be no state, or local governments, but all things, persons and property, must be subject to the laws of one legislature alone; to one executive, and one judiciary. Each state government, as the government of New Jersey, &c. is a consolidated, or one entire government, as it respects the counties, towns, citizens and property within the limits of the state.—The state governments are the basis, the pillar on which the federal head is placed, and [1061]the whole together, when formed on elective principles, constitute a federal republic. A federal republic in itself supposes state or local governments to exist, as the body or props, on which the federal head rests, and that it cannot remain a moment after they cease. In erecting the federal government, and always in its councils, each state must be known as a sovereign body; but in erecting this government, I conceive, the legislature of the state, by the expressed or implied assent of the people, or the people of the state, under the direction of the government of it, may accede to the federal compact: Nor do I conceive it to be necessarily a part of a confederacy of states, that each have an equal voice in the general councils. A confederated republic being organized, each state must retain powers for managing its internal police, and all delegate to the union power to manage general concerns: The quantity of power the union must possess is one thing, the mode of exercising the powers given, is quite a different consideration; and it is the mode of exercising them, that makes one of the essential distinctions between one entire or consolidated government, and a federal republic; that is, however the government may be organized, if the laws of the union, in most important concerns, as in levying and collecting taxes, raising troops, &c. operate immediately upon the persons and property of individuals, and not on states, extend to organizing the militia, &c. the government, as to its administration, as to making and executing laws, is not federal, but consolidated. To illustrate my idea—the union makes a requisition, and assigns to each state its quota of men or monies wanted; each state, by its own laws and officers, in its own way, furnishes its quota: here the state governments stand between the union and individuals; the laws of the union operate only on states, as such, and federally: Here nothing can be done without the meetings of the state legislatures—but in the other case the union, though the state legislatures should not meet for years together, proceeds immediately, by its own laws and officers, to levy and collect monies of individuals, to inlist men, form armies, &c. here the laws of the union operate immediately on the body of the people, on persons and property; in the same manner the laws of one entire consolidated government operate.—These two modes are very distinct, and in their operation and consequences have directly opposite tendencies: The first makes the existence of the state governments indispensable, and throws all the detail business of levying and collecting the taxes, &c. into the hands of those governments, and into the hands, of course, of many thousand officers solely created by, and dependent on the state. The last entirely excludes the agency of the respective states, and throws the whole business [1062]of levying and collecting taxes, &c. into the hands of many thousand officers solely created by, and dependent upon the union, and makes the existence of the state government of no consequence in the case. It is true, congress in raising any given sum in direct taxes, must by the constitution, raise so much of it in one state, and so much in another, by a fixed rule, which most of the states some time since agreed to: But this does not effect the principle in question, it only secures each state against any arbitrary proportions. The federal mode is perfectly safe and eligible, founded in the true spirit of a confederated republic there could be no possible exception to it, did we not find by experience, that the states will sometimes neglect to comply with the reasonable requisitions of the union. It being according to the fundamental principles of federal republics, to raise men and monies by requisitions, and for the states individually to organize and train the militia, I conceive, there can be no reason whatever for departing from them, except this, that the states sometimes neglect to comply with reasonable requisitions, and that it is dangerous to attempt to compel a delinquent state by force, as it may often produce a war. We ought, therefore, to enquire attentively, how extensive the evils to be guarded against are, and cautiously limit the remedies to the extent of the evils. I am not about to defend the confederation, or to charge the proposed constitution with imperfections not in it; but we ought to examine facts, and strip them of the false colourings often given them by incautious observations, by unthinking or designing men. We ought to premise, that laws for raising men and monies, even in consolidated governments, are not often punctually complied with. Historians, except in extraordinary cases, but very seldom take notice of the detail collection of taxes; but these facts we have fully proved, and well attested; that the most energetic governments have relinquished taxes frequently, which were of many years standing. These facts amply prove, that taxes assessed, have remained many years uncollected. I agree there have been instances in the republics of Greece, Holland, &c. in the course of several centuries, of states neglecting to pay their quotas of requisitions; but it is a circumstance certainly deserving of attention, whether these nations which have depended on requisitions principally for their defence, have not raised men and monies nearly as punctually as entire governments, which have taxed directly; whether we have not found the latter as often distressed for the want of troops and monies, as the former. It has been said, that the Amphictionic council, and the Germanic head, have not possessed sufficient powers to controul the members of the republic in a proper manner. Is this, if true, to be imputed to requisitions? Is it not principally to be imputed to the unequal powers [1063]of those members, connected with this important circumstance, that each member possessed power to league itself with foreign powers, and powerful neighbours, without the consent of the head. After all, has not the Germanic body a government as good as its neighbours in general? and did not the Grecian republic remain united several centuries, and form the theatre of human greatness? No government in Europe has commanded monies more plentifully than the government of Holland. As to the United States, the separate states lay taxes directly, and the union calls for taxes by way of requisitions; and is it a fact, that more monies are due in proportion on requisitions in the United States, than on the state taxes directly laid?—It is but about ten years since congress begun to make requisitions, and in that time, the monies, &c. required, and the bounties given for men required of the states, have amounted, specie value, to about 36 millions dollars, about 24 millions of dollars of which have been actually paid; and a very considerable part of the 12 millions not paid, remains so not so much from the neglect of the states, as from the sudden changes in paper money, &c. which in a great measure rendered payments of no service, and which often induced the union indirectly to relinquish one demand, by making another in a different form. Before we totally condemn requisitions, we ought to consider what immense bounties the states gave, and what prodigious exertions they made in the war, in order to comply with the requisitions of congress; and if since the peace they have been delinquent, ought we not carefully to enquire, whether that delinquency is to be imputed solely to the nature of requisitions? ought it not in part to be imputed to two other causes? I mean first, an opinion, that has extensively prevailed, that the requisitions for domestic interest have not been founded on just principles; and secondly, the circumstance, that the government itself, by proposing imposts, &c. has departed virtually from the constitutional system; which proposed changes, like all changes proposed in government, produce an inattention and negligence in the execution of the government in being. I am not for depending wholly on requisitions; but I mention these few facts to shew they are not so totally futile as many pretend. For the truth of many of these facts I appeal to the public records; and for the truth of the others, I appeal to many republican characters, who are best informed in the affairs of the United States. Since the peace, and till the convention reported, the wisest men in the United States generally supposed, that certain limited funds would answer the purposes of the union: and though the states are by no means in so good a condition as I wish they were, yet, I think, I may very safely affirm, they are in a better condition than they would be had congress always possessed [1064]the powers of taxation now contended for. The fact is admitted, that our federal government does not possess sufficient powers to give life and vigor to the political system; and that we experience disappointments, and several inconveniencies; but we ought carefully to distinguish those which are merely the consequences of a severe and tedious war, from those which arise from defects in the federal system. There has been an entire revolution in the United States within thirteen years, and the least we can compute the waste of labour and property at, during that period, by the war, is three hundred million of dollars. Our people are like a man just recovering from a severe fit of sickness. It was the war that disturbed the course of commerce, introduced floods of paper money, the stagnation of credit, and threw many valuable men out of steady business. From these sources our greatest evils arise; men of knowledge and reflection must perceive it;—but then, have we not done more in three or four years past, in repairing the injuries of the war, by repairing houses and estates, restoring industry, frugality, the fisheries, manufactures, &c. and thereby laying the foundation of good government, and of individual and political happiness, than any people ever did in a like time; we must judge from a view of the country and facts, and not from foreign newspapers, or our own, which are printed chiefly in the commercial towns, where imprudent living, imprudent importations, and many unexpected disappointments, have produced a despondency, and a disposition to view every thing on the dark side. Some of the evils we feel, all will agree, ought to be imputed to the defective administration of the governments. From these and various considerations, I am very clearly of opinion, that the evils we sustain, merely on account of the defects of the confederation, are but as a feather in the balance against a mountain, compared with those which would, infallibly, be the result of the loss of general liberty, and that happiness men enjoy under a frugal, free, and mild government. Heretofore we do not seem to have seen danger any where, but in giving power to congress, and now no where but in congress wanting powers; and, without examining the extent of the evils to be remedied, by one step, we are for giving up to congress almost all powers of any importance without limitation. The defects of the confederation are extravagantly magnified, and every species of pain we feel imputed to them: and hence it is inferred, there must be a total change of the principles, as well as forms of government: and in the main point, touching the federal powers, we rest all on a logical inference, totally inconsistent with experience and sound political reasoning. It is said, that as the federal head must make peace and war, and provide for the common defence, it ought to possess all powers necessary to that end: that powers unlimited, as to the purse and sword, to raise men and monies, and form the militia, are necessary to that end; and, therefore, the federal head ought to possess them. This reasoning is far more specious than solid: it is necessary that these powers so exist in the body politic, as to be called into exercise whenever necessary for the public safety; but it is by no means true, that the man, or congress of men, whose duty it more immediately is to provide for the common defence, ought to possess them without limitation. But clear it is, that if such men, or congress, be not in a situation to hold them without danger to liberty, he or they ought not to possess them. It has long been thought to be a well founded position, that the purse and sword ought not to be placed in the same hands in a free government. Our wise ancestors have carefully separated them—placed the sword in the hands of their king, even under considerable limitations, and the purse in the hands of the commons alone: yet the king makes peace and war, and it is his duty to provide for the common defence of the nation. This authority at least goes thus far—that a nation, well versed in the science of government, does not conceive it to be necessary or expedient for the man entrusted with the common defence and general tranquility, to possess unlimitedly the powers in question, or even in any considerable degree. Could he, whose duty it is to defend the public, possess in himself independently, all the means of doing it consistent with the public good, it might be convenient: but the people of England know that their liberties and happiness would be in infinitely greater danger from the king’s unlimited possession of these powers, than from all external enemies and internal commotions to which they might be exposed: therefore, though they have made it his duty to guard the empire, yet they have wisely placed in other hands, the hands of their representatives, the power to deal out and controul the means. In Holland their high mightinesses must provide for the common defence, but for the means they depend, in a considerable degree, upon requisitions made on the state or local assemblies. Reason and facts evince, that however convenient it might be for an executive magistrate, or federal head, more immediately charged with the national defence and safety, solely, directly, and independently to possess all the means; yet such magistrate, or head, never ought to possess them, if thereby the public liberties shall be endangered. The powers in question never have been, by nations wise and free, deposited, nor can they ever be, with safety, any where, but in the principal [1066]members of the national system:—where these form one entire government, as in Great-Britain, they are separated and lodged in the principal members of it. But in a federal republic, there is quite a different organization; the people form this kind of government, generally, because their territories are too extensive to admit of their assembling in one legislature, or of executing the laws on free principles under one entire government. They convene in their local assemblies, for local purposes, and for managing their internal concerns, and unite their states under a federal head for general purposes. It is the essential characteristic of a confederated republic, that this head be dependant on, and kept within limited bounds by, the local governments; and it is because, in these alone, in fact, the people can be substantially assembled or represented. It is, therefore, we very universally see, in this kind of government, the congressional powers placed in a few hands, and accordingly limited, and specifically enumerated: and the local assemblies strong and well guarded, and composed of numerous members. Wise men will always place the controuling power where the people are substantially collected by their representatives. By the proposed system, the federal head will possess, without limitation, almost every species of power that can, in its exercise, tend to change the government, or to endanger liberty; while in it, I think it has been fully shewn, the people will have but the shadow of representation, and but the shadow of security for their rights and liberties. In a confederated republic, the division of representation, &c. in its nature, requires a correspondent division and deposit of powers, relative to taxes and military concerns: and I think the plan offered stands quite alone, in confounding the principles of governments in themselves totally distinct. I wish not to exculpate the states for their improper neglects in not paying their quotas of requisitions; but, in applying the remedy, we must be governed by reason and facts. It will not be denied, that the people have a right to change the government when the majority chuse it, if not restrained by some existing compact—that they have a right to displace their rulers, and consequently to determine when their measures are reasonable or not—and that they have a right, at any time, to put a stop to those measures they may deem prejudicial to them, by such forms and negatives as they may see fit to provide. From all these, and many other well founded considerations, I need not mention, a question arises, what powers shall there be delegated to the federal head, to insure safety, as well as energy, in the government? I think there is a safe and proper medium pointed out by experience, by reason, and facts. When we have organized the government, we ought to [1067]give power to the union, so far only as experience and present circumstances shall direct, with a reasonable regard to time to come. Should future circumstances, contrary to our expectations, require that further powers be transferred to the union, we can do it far more easily, than get back those we may now imprudently give. The system proposed is untried: candid advocates and opposers admit, that it is, in a degree, a mere experiment, and that its organization is weak and imperfect; surely then, the safe ground is cautiously to vest power in it, and when we are sure we have given enough for ordinary exigencies, to be extremely careful how we delegate powers, which, in common cases, must necessarily be useless or abused, and of very uncertain effect in uncommon ones. By giving the union power to regulate commerce, and to levy and collect taxes by imposts, we give it an extensive authority, and permanent productive funds, I believe quite as adequate to the present demands of the union, as excises and direct taxes can be made to the present demands of the separate states. The state governments are now about four times as expensive as that of the union; and their several state debts added together, are nearly as large as that of the union—Our impost duties since the peace have been almost as productive as the other sources of taxation, and when under one general system of regulations, the probability is, that those duties will be very considerably increased: Indeed the representation proposed will hardly justify giving to congress unlimited powers to raise taxes by imposts, in addition to the other powers the union must necessarily have. It is said, that if congress possess only authority to raise taxes by imposts, trade probably will be overburdened with taxes, and the taxes of the union be found inadequate to any uncommon exigencies: To this we may observe, that trade generally finds its own level, and will naturally and necessarily heave off any undue burdens laid upon it: further, if congress alone possess the impost, and also unlimited power to raise monies by excises and direct taxes, there must be much more danger that two taxing powers, the union and states, will carry excises and direct taxes to an unreasonable extent, especially as these have not the natural boundaries taxes on trade have. However, it is not my object to propose to exclude congress from raising monies by internal taxes, as by duties, excises, and direct taxes; but my opinion is, that congress, especially in its proposed organization, ought not to raise monies by internal taxes, except in strict conformity to the federal plan; that is, by the agency of the state governments in all cases, except where a state shall neglect, for an unreasonable time, to pay its quota of a requisition; and never [1068]where so many of the state legislatures as represent a majority of the people, shall formally determine an excise law or requisition is improper, in their next session after the same be laid before them. We ought always to recollect that the evil to be guarded against is found by our own experience, and the experience of others, to be mere neglect in the states to pay their quotas; and power in the union to levy and collect the neglecting states’ quotas with interest, is fully adequate to the evil. By this federal plan, with this exception mentioned, we secure the means of collecting the taxes by the usual process of law, and avoid the evil of attempting to compel or coerce a state; and we avoid also a circumstance, which never yet could be, and I am fully confident never can be, admitted in a free federal republic; I mean a permanent and continued system of tax laws of the union, executed in the bowels of the states by many thousand officers, dependent as to the assessing and collecting federal taxes, solely upon the union. On every principle then, we ought to provide, that the union render an exact account of all monies raised by imposts and other taxes; and that whenever monies shall be wanted for the purposes of the union, beyond the proceeds of the impost duties, requisitions shall be made on the states for the monies so wanted; and that the power of laying and collecting shall never be exercised, except in cases where a state shall neglect, a given time, to pay its quota. This mode seems to be strongly pointed out by the reason of the case, and spirit of the government; and I believe, there is no instance to be found in a federal republic, where the congressional powers ever extended generally to collecting monies by direct taxes or excises. Creating all these restrictions, still the powers of the union in matters of taxation, will be too unlimited; further checks, in my mind, are indispensably necessary. Nor do I conceive, that as full a representation as is practicable in the federal government, will afford sufficient security: the strength of the government, and the confidence of the people, must be collected principally in the local assemblies; every part or branch of the federal head must be feeble, and unsafely trusted with large powers. A government possessed of more power than its constituent parts will justify, will not only probably abuse it, but be unequal to bear its own burden; it may as soon be destroyed by the pressure of power, as languish and perish for want of it. There are two ways further of raising checks, and guarding against undue combinations and influence in a federal system. The first is, in levying taxes, raising and keeping up armies, in building navies, in forming plans for the militia, and in appropriating monies for the support of the military, to require the attendance of a large proportion of [1069]the federal representatives, as two-thirds or three-fourths of them; and in passing laws, in these important cases, to require the consent of two-thirds or three-fourths of the members present. The second is, by requiring that certain important laws of the federal head, as a requisition or a law for raising monies by excise shall be laid before the state legislatures, and if disapproved of by a given number of them, say by as many of them as represent a majority of the people, the law shall have no effect. Whether it would be adviseable to adopt both, or either of these checks, I will not undertake to determine. We have seen them both exist in confederated republics. The first exists substantially in the confederation, and will exist in some measure in the plan proposed, as in chusing a president by the house, in expelling members; in the senate, in making treaties, and in deciding on impeachments, and in the whole in altering the constitution. The last exists in the United Netherlands, but in a much greater extent. The first is founded on this principle, that these important measures may, sometimes, be adopted by a bare quorum of members, perhaps, from a few states, and that a bare majority of the federal representatives may frequently be of the aristocracy, or some particular interests, connections, or parties in the community, and governed by motives, views, and inclinations not compatible with the general interest.—The last is founded on this principle, that the people will be substantially represented, only in their state or local assemblies; that their principal security must be found in them; and that, therefore, they ought to have ultimately a constitutional controul over such interesting measures. I have often heard it observed, that our people are well informed, and will not submit to oppressive governments; that the state governments will be their ready advocates, and possess their confidence, mix with them, and enter into all their wants and feelings. This is all true; but of what avail will these circumstances be, if the state governments, thus allowed to be the guardians of the people, possess no kind of power by the forms of the social compact, to stop, in their passage, the laws of congress injurious to the people. State governments must stand and see the law take place; they may complain and petition—so may individuals; the members of them, in extreme cases, may resist, on the principles of self-defence—so may the people and individuals. It has been observed, that the people, in extensive territories, have more power, compared with that of their rulers, than in small states. Is not directly the opposite true? The people in a small state can unite and act in concert, and with vigour; but in large territories, the men who govern find it more easy to unite, while people cannot; while they [1070]cannot collect the opinions of each part, while they move to different points, and one part is often played off against the other. It has been asserted, that the confederate head of a republic at best, is in general weak and dependent;—that the people will attach themselves to, and support their local governments, in all disputes with the union. Admit the fact: is it any way to remove the inconvenience by accumulating powers upon a weak organization? The fact is, that the detail administration of affairs, in this mixed republic, depends principally on the local governments; and the people would be wretched without them: and a great proportion of social happiness depends on the internal administration of justice, and on internal police. The splendor of the monarch, and the power of the government are one thing. The happiness of the subject depends on very different causes: but it is to the latter, that the best men, the greatest ornaments of human nature, have most carefully attended: it is to the former tyrants and oppressors have always aimed. LETTER XVIII. January 25, 1788. Dear Sir, I am persuaded, a federal head never was formed, that possessed half the powers which it could carry into full effect, altogether independently of the state or local governments, as the one, the convention has proposed, will possess. Should the state legislatures never meet, except merely for chusing federal senators and appointing electors, once in four and six years, the federal head may go on for ages to make all laws relative to the following subjects, and by its own courts, officers, and provisions, carry them into full effect, and to any extent it may deem for the general welfare; that is, for raising taxes, borrowing and coining monies, and for applying them—for forming and governing armies and navies, and for directing their operations—for regulating commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes—for regulating bankruptcies, weights and measures, post-offices and post-roads, and captures on land and water—for establishing a uniform rule of naturalization, and for promoting the progress of science and useful arts—for defining and punishing piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, the offences of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States, and offences against the law of nations, and for regulating all maritime concerns—for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia (the respective states training them, and appointing the officers)—for calling them forth when wanted, and for governing them when in the service of the union—for the sole and exclusive government of a federal city or [1071]town, not exceeding ten miles square, and of places ceded for forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings—for granting letters of marque and reprisal, and making war—for regulating the times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives—for making and concluding all treaties, and carrying them into execution—for judicially deciding all questions arising on the constitution, laws, and treaties of the union, in law and equity, and questions arising on state laws also, where ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, where the United States, individual states, or a state, where citizens of different states, and where foreign states, or a foreign subject, are parties or party—for impeaching and trying federal officers—for deciding on elections, and for expelling members, &c. All these enumerated powers we must examine and contemplate in all their extent and various branches, and then reflect, that the federal head will have full power to make all laws whatever respecting them; and for carrying into full effect all powers vested in the union, in any department, or officers of it, by the constitution, in order to see the full extent of the federal powers, which will be supreme, and exercised by that head at pleasure, conforming to the few limitations mentioned in the constitution. Indeed, I conceive, it is impossible to see them in their full extent at present: we see vast undefined powers lodged in a weak organization, but cannot, by the enquiries of months and years, clearly discern them in all their numerous branches. These powers in feeble hands, must be tempting objects for ambition and a love of power and fame. But, say the advocates, they are all necessary for forming an energetic federal government; all necessary in the hands of the union, for the common defence and general welfare. In these great points they appear to me to go from the end to the means, and from the means to the end, perpetually begging the question. I think in the course of these letters, I shall sufficiently prove, that some of these powers need not be lodged in the hands of the union—that others ought to be exercised under better checks, and in part, by the agency of the states—some I have already considered, some in my mind, are not liable to objections, and the others, I shall briefly notice in this closing letter. The power to controul the military forces of the country, as well as the revenues of it, requires serious attention. Here again, I must premise, that a federal republic is a compound system, made up of constituent parts, each essential to the whole: we must then expect the real friends of such a system will always be very anxious for the security and preservation of each part, and to this end, that each constitutionally possess its natural portion of power and influence—and that it will [1072]constantly be an object of concern to them, to see one part armed at all points by the constitution, and in a manner destructive in the end, even of its own existence, and the others left constitutionally defenceless. The military forces of a free country may be considered under three general descriptions—1. The militia. 2. the navy—and 3. the regular troops—and the whole ought ever to be, and understood to be, in strict subordination to the civil authority; and that regular troops, and select corps, ought not to be kept up without evident necessity. Stipulations in the constitution to this effect, are perhaps, too general to be of much service, except merely to impress on the minds of the people and soldiery, that the military ought ever to be subject to the civil authority, &c. But particular attention, and many more definite stipulations, are highly necessary to render the military safe, and yet useful in a free government; and in a federal republic, where the people meet in distinct assemblies, many stipulations are necessary to keep a part from transgressing, which would be unnecessary checks against the whole met in one legislature, in one entire government.—A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves, and render regular troops in a great measure unnecessary. The powers to form and arm the militia, to appoint their officers, and to command their services, are very important; nor ought they in a confederated republic to be lodged, solely, in any one member of the government. First, the constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia, by providing that the militia shall always be kept well organized, armed, and disciplined, and include, according to the past and general usuage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms; and that all regulations tending to render this general militia useless and defenceless, by establishing select corps of militia, or distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests and attachments in the community to be avoided. I am persuaded, I need not multiply words to convince you of the value and solidity of this principle, as it respects general liberty, and the duration of a free and mild government: having this principle well fixed by the constitution, then the federal head may prescribe a general uniform plan, on which the respective states shall form and train the militia, appoint their officers and solely manage them, except when called into the service of the union, and when called into that service, they may be commanded and governed by the union. This arrangement combines energy and safety in it; it places the sword in the hands of the solid interest of the community, and not in the hands of men destitute of property, of principle, or of attachment to the society and government, who often form the select corps of peace or [1073]ordinary establishments: by it, the militia are the people, immediately under the management of the state governments, but on a uniform federal plan, and called into the service, command, and government of the union, when necessary for the common defence and general tranquility. But, say gentlemen, the general militia are for the most part employed at home in their private concerns, cannot well be called out, or be depended upon; that we must have a select militia; that is, as I understand it, particular corps or bodies of young men, and of men who have but little to do at home, particularly armed and disciplined in some measure, at the public expence, and always ready to take the field. These corps, not much unlike regular troops, will ever produce an inattention to the general militia; and the consequence has ever been, and always must be, that the substantial men, having families and property, will generally be without arms, without knowing the use of them, and defenceless; whereas, to preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them; nor does it follow from this, that all promiscuously must go into actual service on every occasion. The mind that aims at a select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican principle; and when we see many men disposed to practice upon it, whenever they can prevail, no wonder true republicans are for carefully guarding against it. As a farther check, it may be proper to add, that the militia of any state shall not remain in the service of the union, beyond a given period, without the express consent of the state legislature. As to the navy, I do not see that it can have any connection with the local governments. The want of employment for it, and the want of monies in the hands of the union, must be its proper limitation. The laws for building or increasing it, as all the important laws mentioned in a former letter, touching military and money matters, may be checked by requiring the attendance of a large proportion of the representatives, and the consent of a large proportion of those present, to pass them as before mentioned.50 By art. 1. sect. 8. “Congress shall have power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia”: power to provide for—does this imply any more than power to prescribe a general uniform plan? And must not the respective states pass laws (but in conformity to the plan) for forming and training the militia. In the present state of mankind, and of conducting war, the government of every nation must have power to raise and keep up regular troops: the question is, how shall this power be lodged? In an entire government, as in Great-Britain, where the people assemble by their [1074]representatives in one legislature, there is no difficulty, it is of course properly lodged in that legislature: But in a confederated republic, where the organization consists of a federal head, and local governments, there is no one part in which it can be solely, and safely lodged. By art. 1. sect. 8. “congress shall have power to raise and support armies,” &c. By art. 1. sect. 10. “no state, without the consent of congress, shall keep troops, or ships of war, in time of peace.” It seems fit the union should direct the raising of troops, and the union may do it in two ways; by requisitions on the states, or by direct taxes—the first is most conformable to the federal plan, and safest; and it may be improved, by giving the union power, by its own laws and officers, to raise the states quota that may neglect, and to charge it with the expence; and by giving a fixed quorum of the state legislatures power to disapprove the requisition. There would be less danger in this power to raise troops, could the state governments keep a proper controul over the purse and over the militia; but after all the precautions we can take, without evidently fettering the union too much, we must give a large accumulation of powers to it, in these and other respects. There is one check, which, I think, may be added with great propriety–that is, no land forces shall be kept up, but by legislative acts annually passed by congress, and no appropriation of monies for their support shall be for a longer term than one year. This is the constitutional practice in Great-Britain, and the reasons for such checks in the United States appear to be much stronger. We may also require that these acts be passed by a special majority, as before mentioned. There is another mode still more guarded, and which seems to be founded in the true spirit of a federal system: it seems proper to divide those powers we can with safety, lodge them in no one member of the government alone; yet substantially to preserve their use, and to ensure duration to the government, by modifying the exercise of them–it is to empower congress to raise troops by direct levies, not exceeding a given number, say 2000 in time of peace, and 12,000 in a time of war, and for such further troops as may be wanted, to raise them by requisitions qualified as before mentioned. By the above recited clause no state shall keep troops, &c. in time of peace–this clearly implies, it may do it in time of war: this must be on the principle, that the union cannot defend all parts of the republic, and suggests an idea very repugnant to the general tendency of the system proposed, which is to disarm the state governments: a state in a long war may collect forces sufficient to take the field against the neighbouring states. This clause was copied from the confederation, in which it was of more importance than in the plan proposed, because under this the separate states, probably, will have but small revenues. By article 1. section 8. congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, throughout the United States. It is to be observed, that the separate states have ever been in possession of the power, and in the use of it, of making bankrupt laws, militia laws, and laws in some other cases, respecting which, the new constitution, when adopted, will give the union power to legislate, &c.–but no words are used by the constitution to exclude the jurisdiction of the several states, and whether they will be excluded or not, or whether they and the union will have concurrent jurisdiction or not, must be determined by inference; and from the nature of the subject; if the power, for instance, to make uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, is in its nature indivisible, or incapable of being exercised by two legislatures independently, or by one in aid of the other, then the states are excluded, and cannot legislate at all on the subject, even though the union should neglect or find it impracticable to establish uniform bankrupt laws. How far the union will find it practicable to do this, time only can fully determine. When we consider the extent of the country, and the very different ideas of the different parts in it, respecting credit, and the mode of making men’s property liable for paying their debts, we may, I think, with some degree of certainty, conclude that the union never will be able to establish such laws; but if practicable, it does not appear to me, on further reflection, that the union ought to have the power; it does not appear to me to be a power properly incidental to a federal head, and, I believe, no one ever possessed it; it is a power that will immediately and extensively interfere with the internal police of the separate states, especially with their administering justice among their own citizens. By giving this power to the union, we greatly extend the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, as all questions arising on bankrupt laws, being laws of the union, even between citizens of the same state, may be tried in the federal courts; and I think it may be shewn, that by the help of these laws, actions between citizens of different states, and the laws of the federal city, aided by no overstrained judicial fictions, almost all civil causes may be drawn into those courts. We must be sensible how cautious we ought to be in extending unnecessarily the jurisdiction of those courts for reasons I need not repeat. This article of power too, will considerably increase, in the hands of the union, an accumulation of powers, some of a federal and some of a unfederal nature, too large without it. The constitution provides, that congress shall have the sole and exclusive government of what is called the federal city, a place not exceeding ten miles square, and of all places ceded for forts, dock-yards, &c. I believe this is a novel kind of provision in a federal republic; it is repugnant to the spirit of such a government, and must be founded in [1076]an apprehension of a hostile disposition between the federal head and the state governments; and it is not improbable, that the sudden retreat of congress from Philadelphia, first gave rise to it.51–With this apprehension, we provide, the government of the union shall have secluded places, cities, and castles of defence, which no state laws whatever shall invade. When we attentively examine this provision in all its consequences, it opens to view scenes almost without bounds. A federal, or rather a national city, ten miles square, containing a hundred square miles, is about four times as large as London; and for forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings, congress may possess a number of places or towns in each state. It is true, congress cannot have them unless the state legislatures cede them; but when once ceded, they never can be recovered, and though the general temper of the legislatures may be averse to such cessions, yet many opportunities and advantages may be taken of particular times and circumstances of complying assemblies, and of particular parties, to obtain them. It is not improbable, that some considerable towns or places, in some intemperate moments, or influenced by anti-republican principles, will petition to be ceded for the purposes mentioned in the provision. There are men, and even towns, in the best republics, which are often fond of withdrawing from the government of them, whenever occasion shall present. The case is still stronger; if the provision in question holds out allurements to attempt to withdraw, the people of a state must ever be subject to state as well as federal taxes; but the federal city and places will be subject only to the latter, and to them by no fixed proportion; nor of the taxes raised in them, can the separate states demand any account of congress.–These doors opened for withdrawing from the state governments entirely, may, on other accounts, be very alluring and pleasing to those anti-republican men who prefer a place under the wings of courts. If a federal town be necessary for the residence of congress and the public officers, it ought to be a small one, and the government of it fixed on republican and common law principles, carefully enumerated and established by the constitution. It is true, the states, when they shall cede places, may stipulate, that the laws and government of congress in them, shall always be formed on such principles; but it is easy to discern, that the stipulations of a state, or of the inhabitants of the place ceded, can be of but little avail against the power and gradual encroachments of the union. The principles ought to be established by the federal constitution, to which all the states are parties; but in no event can there be any need of so large a city and places for forts, &c. [1077]totally exempted from the laws and jurisdictions of the state governments. If I understand the constitution, the laws of congress, constitutionally made, will have complete and supreme jurisdiction to all federal purposes, on every inch of ground in the United States, and exclusive jurisdiction on the high seas, and this by the highest authority, the consent of the people. Suppose ten acres at West-Point shall be used as a fort of the union, or a sea port town as a dock-yard, the laws of the union in those places respecting the navy, forces of the union, and all federal objects, must prevail, be noticed by all judges and officers, and executed accordingly: and I can discern no one reason for excluding from these places, the operation of state laws, as to mere state purposes; for instance, for the collection of state taxes in them, recovering debts, deciding questions of property arising within them on state laws, punishing, by state laws, theft, trespasses, and offences committed in them by mere citizens against the state laws. The city, and all the places in which the union shall have this exclusive jurisdiction, will be immediately under one entire government, that of the federal head; and be no part of any state, and consequently no part of the United States. The inhabitants of the federal city and places, will be as much exempt from the laws and controul of the state governments, as the people of Canada or Nova Scotia will be. Neither the laws of the states respecting taxes, the militia, crimes or property, will extend to them; nor is there a single stipulation in the constitution, that the inhabitants of this city, and these places, shall be governed by laws founded on principles of freedom. All questions, civil and criminal, arising on the laws of these places, which must be the laws of congress, must be decided in the federal courts; and also, all questions that may, by such judicial fictions as these courts may consider reasonable, be supposed to arise within this city, or any of these places, may be brought into these courts; and by a very common legal fiction, any personal contract may be supposed to have been made in any place. A contract made in Georgia may be supposed to have been made in the federal city, in Pennsylvania; the courts will admit the fiction, and not in these cases, make it a serious question, where it was in fact made. Every suit in which an inhabitant of a federal district may be a party, of course may be instituted in the federal courts–also, every suit in which it may be alledged, and not denied, that a party in it is an inhabitant of such a district–also, every suit to which a foreign state or subject, the union, a state, citizens of different states, in fact, or by reasonable legal fictions, may be a party or parties: And thus, by means of bankrupt laws, federal districts, &c. almost all judicial business, I apprehend may be carried into the federal courts, without essentially departing from the usual [1078]course of judicial proceedings. The courts in Great Britain have acquired their powers, and extended, very greatly, their jurisdictions by such fictions and suppositions as I have mentioned. The constitution, in these points, certainly involves in it principles, and almost hidden cases, which may unfold, and in time exhibit consequences we hardly think of. The power of naturalization, when viewed in connection with the judicial powers and cases, is, in my mind, of very doubtful extent. By the constitution itself, the citizens of each state will be naturalized citizens of every state, to the general purposes of instituting suits, claiming the benefits of the laws, &c. And in order to give the federal courts jurisdiction of an action, between citizens of the same state, in common acceptation, may not a court allow the plaintiff to say, he is a citizen of one state, and the defendant a citizen of another, without carrying legal fictions so far, by any means, as they have been carried by the courts of King’s Bench and Exchequer, in order to bring causes within their cognizance–Further, the federal city and districts, will be totally distinct from any state, and a citizen of a state will not of course be a subject of any of them; and to avail himself of the privileges and immunities of them, must he not be naturalized by congress in them? and may not congress make any proportion of the citizens of the states naturalized subjects of the federal city and districts, and thereby entitle them to sue or defend, in all cases, in the federal courts? I have my doubts, and many sensible men, I find, have their doubts, on these points; and we ought to observe, they must be settled in the courts of law, by their rules, distinctions, and fictions. To avoid many of these intricacies and difficulties, and to avoid the undue and unnecessary extension of the federal judicial powers, it appears to me, that no federal districts ought to be allowed, and no federal city or town, except perhaps a small town, in which the government shall be republican, but in which congress shall have no jurisdiction over the inhabitants, but in common with the other inhabitants of the states. Can the union want, in such a town, any thing more than a right to the soil on which it may set its buildings, and extensive jurisdiction over the federal buildings, and property, its own members, officers, and servants in it? As to all federal objects, the union will have complete jurisdiction over them, of course any where, and every where. I still think, that no actions ought to be allowed to be brought in the federal courts, between citizens of different states, at least, unless the cause be of very considerable importance: that no action against a state government, by any citizen or foreigner, ought to be allowed, and no action, in which a foreign subject is party, at least, unless it be of very considerable importance, ought to be instituted in the federal courts—I confess, I can see no [1079]reason whatever, for a foreigner, or for citizens of different states, carrying sixpenny causes into the federal courts; I think the state courts will be found by experience, to be bottomed on better principles, and to administer justice better than the federal courts. The difficulties and dangers I have supposed, will result from so large a federal city, and federal districts, from the extension of the federal judicial powers, &c. are not, I conceive, merely possible, but probable. I think, pernicious political consequences will follow from them, and from the federal city especially, for very obvious reasons, a few of which I will mention. We must observe, that the citizens of a state will be subject to state as well as federal taxes, and the inhabitants of the federal city and districts, only to such taxes as congress may lay–We are not to suppose all our people are attached to free government, and the principles of the common law, but that many thousands of them will prefer a city governed, not on republican principles–This city, and the government of it, must indubitably take their tone from the characters of the men, who from the nature of its situation and institution, must collect there. This city will not be established for productive labour, for mercantile, or mechanic industry; but for the residence of government, its officers and attendants. If hereafter it should ever become a place of trade and industry, in the early periods of its existence, when its laws and government must receive their fixed tone, it must be a mere court, with its appendages, the executive, congress, the law courts, gentlemen of fortune and pleasure, with all the officers, attendants, suitors, expectants and dependants on the whole, however brilliant and honourable this collection may be, if we expect it will have any sincere attachments to simple and frugal republicanism, to that liberty and mild government, which is dear to the laborious part of a free people, we most assuredly deceive ourselves. This early collection will draw to it men from all parts of the country, of a like political description: we see them looking towards the place already. Such a city, or town, containing a hundred square miles, must soon be the great, the visible, and dazzling centre, the mistress of fashions, and the fountain of politics. There may be a free or shackled press in this city, and the streams which may issue from it may overflow the country, and they will be poisonous or pure, as the fountain may be corrupt or not. But not to dwell on a subject that must give pain to the virtuous friends of freedom, I will only add, can a free and enlightened people create a common head so extensive, so prone to corruption and slavery, as this city probably will be, when they have it in their power to form one pure and chaste, frugal and republican. Under the confederation congress has no power whereby to govern its own officers and servant[s]; a federal town, in which congress might have special jurisdiction, might be expedient; but under the new constitution, without a federal town, congress will have all necessary powers of course over its officers and servants; indeed it will have a complete system of powers to all the federal purposes mentioned in the constitution; so that the reason for a federal town under the confederation, will by no means exist under the constitution.–Even if a trial by jury should be admitted in the federal city, what man, with any state attachments or republican virtue about him, will submit to be tried by a jury of it. I might observe more particularly upon several other parts of the constitution proposed; but it has been uniformly my object in examining a subject so extensive, and difficult in many parts to be illustrated, to avoid unimportant things, and not to dwell upon points not very material. The rule for apportioning requisitions on the states, having some time since been agreed to by eleven states,52 I have viewed as settled. The stipulation that congress, after twenty one years may prohibit the importation of slaves, is a point gained, if not so favourable as could be wished for. As monopolies in trade perhaps, can in no case be useful, it might not be amiss to provide expressly against them. I wish the power to repri[e]ve and pardon was more cautiously lodged, and under some limitations. I do not see why congress should be allowed to consent that a person may accept a present, office, or title of a foreign prince, &c. As to the state governments, as well as the federal, are essential parts of the system, why should not the oath taken by the officers be expressly to support the whole? As to debts due to and from the union, I think the constitution intends, on examining art. 4. sect. 8. and art. 6. that they shall stand on the same ground under the constitution as under the confederation. In the article respecting amendments, it is stipulated that no state shall ever be deprived of its equal vote in the senate without its consent; and that alterations may be made by the consent of three-fourths of the states. Stipulations to bind the majority of the people may serve one purpose, to prevent frequent motions for change; but these attempts to bind the majority, generally give occasion for breach of contract. The states all agreed about seven years ago, that the confederation should remain unaltered, unless every state should agree to alterations:53 but we now see it agreed by the convention, and four states,54 that the old confederacy shall be destroyed, and a new one, of nine states, be erected, if nine only shall come in. Had we agreed, that a majority should alter the confederation, a majority’s agreeing would have bound the rest: but now we must [1081]break the old league, unless all the states agree to alter, or not proceed with adopting the constitution. Whether the adoption by nine states will not produce a nearly equal and dangerous division of the people for and against the constitution–whether the circumstances of the country were such as to justify the hazarding a probability of such a situation, I shall not undertake to determine. I shall leave it to be determined hereafter, whether nine states, under a new federal compact, can claim the benefits of any treaties made with a confederation of thirteen, under a distinct compact and form of existence–whether the new confederacy can recover debts due to the old confederacy, or the arrears of taxes due from the states excluded. It has been well observed, that our country is extensive, and has no external enemies to press the parts together: that, therefore, their union must depend on strong internal ties. I differ with the gentlemen who make these observations only in this, they hold the ties ought to be strengthened by a considerable degree of internal consolidation; and my object is to form them and strengthen them, on pure federal principles. Whatever may be the fate of many valuable and necessary amendments in the constitution proposed, the ample discussion and respectable opposition it will receive, will have a good effect–they will operate to produce a mild and prudent administration, and to put the wheels of the whole system in motion on proper principles–they will evince, that true republican principles and attachments are still alive and formidable in this country. These, in view, I believe, even men quite disposed to make a bad use of the system, will long hesitate before they will resolve to do it. A majority from a view of our situation, and influenced by many considerations, may acquiese in the adoption of this constitution; but, it is evident, that a very great majority of the people of the United States think it, in many parts, an unnecessary and unadviseable departure from true republican and federal principles."

Letter,No,George Clinton,Edmund Randolph,,,5/8/1788,"Your Excellency’s letter of the 27th. of December, altho’ it appears to have been committed to the Post Office at Richmond, did not come to my Hands until the 7th. of March. The Act inclosed was immediately communicated to the Legislature, but it was after they had passed their Resolutions for calling a Convention and so near the Close of their Sessions that no Order was taken in Consequence of it.– The System of Government proposed by the federal Convention is an Object of such vast Importance to the Happiness of America that it appears to me essential that the People of the different States cultivate and cherish the most friendly Sentiments towards each other especially during their Deliberations on that interesting Subject. The Convention of this State are to meet at Poughkeepsie on the 17th. of June to take the proposed System into Consideration and I am persuaded they will with great Cordiality hold a Communication with any Sister State on the important Subject and especially with one so respectable in Point of Importance, Ability and Patriotism as Virginia; I think I may venture to assure your Excellency that the people of this State are disposed to keep up that friendly Intercourse and preserve that Unanimity respecting any great Change of Government which appears to be the Object of the Act of your Legislature and which it is the Duty of every good Man to promote and cherish, and I have no Doubt but that our Convention will possess the same Sentiments–As the Session of your Convention will take Place before that of this State they will I presume commence the Measures for holding such Communications as shall be deemed necessary. I cannot refrain expressing a Regret that a similar Conduct has not been observed by the States who have already had the proposed System under Consideration–Friendly Communications on the Subject and temperate Discussions would it is to be presumed have had a most happy Tendency in accomodating it much more to the Sentiments and Wishes of the People of America than is likely to be the Case in the Form it is offered by the general Convention and acceded to by some of the States–Should it be adopted by small Majorities in the larger States we cannot reasonably hope it will operate so as to answer the salutary Purposes designed; for I presume it may be laid down as a certain Truth that no Government can be exercised over this Country in its present Condition that is not supported by the Affections and Confidence of the People in general– As I have no Direction from the Legislature on the Subject of your Communications, your Excellency will be pleased to consider this Letter as expressive of my own Sentiments, but I have at the same time a well founded Confidence that a Majority of the People of the State over which I have the Honor to preside will concur in them."
Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,5/15/1788,"Extract of a letter from a young gentleman in New-York, to his friend in this city. “I am not a little, but very much surprised that seven of our states should hurry themselves headlong into the important measure of ratifying the federal constitution, without even giving themselves time of [1097]thinking how its effects might probably be felt, not only by us, but posterity. For though it may, like Plato’s republic, please our fancy by exhibiting to our views delightful scenes and flattering prospects; but experience, the great mother of knowledge, only can evince us whether its effects will meet with our approbation, or whether they will be consistent with our welfare, or the contrary? If this be granted, Why in the name of common sense, did not those seven states prescribe limits, by fixing a period to its duration? Suppose, fifteen years, or twenty, if, in the course of that time, those pleasing effects, which it portends in theory, should be realized in practice, how easy could it have been prolonged. I confess to you with that usual candor that I am a friend to the constitution; notwithstanding which, I think too much circumspection cannot be used, how we acquiesce in and adopt measures of this important and singular nature; the repeal or amendment of which, should they prove oppressive, might be attended with serious and dreadful consequences. What do you think of my idea of limiting the constitution? Is it not new, and unhinted of by any of our battering heroes’? And don’t you imagine, nay are you not assured, that the improvement of this idea, as singular as it seems to be, is essentially necessary, that its consequences may in all probability be the salvation of our liberty? I am almost assured in my own mind, you will not hesitate in joining me in this opinion, as also in that, that every well-wisher to this country would, were this important question put to them. Answer me these questions in your next candidly.”"
Letter,No,New York Federal Republican Committee,Richard Henry Lee,,,5/18/1788,"The Importance of the Subject upon which we address you, we trust will be a sufficient Apology for the Liberty we take. The System of Government proposed by the late Convention to the respective States for their Adoption, involves in it Questions and Consequences in the highest Degree interesting to the People of these States. While we see, in common with our Brethren of the other States, the Necessity of making Alterations in the present existing federal Government, we cannot but apprehend that the one proposed in its Room contains in it Principles dangerous to public Liberty and Safety. It would far exceed the Bounds of a Letter to detail to you our Objections to the proposed2 Constitution. And it is the less necessary that we should do it, as they are well stated in a Publication, which we take the Liberty of transmitting you in a series of Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican.3 We renounce all Ideas of local Objections and confine ourselves to such only as affect the Cause of general Liberty, and are drawn from those genuine Republican Principles and Maxims, which we consider as the Glory of our Country, and which gave rise to the late glorious Revolution and supported the Patriots of America in supporting4 it. Impressed with these Sentiments we hold it a Duty we owe our Country our Posterity and the Rights of Mankind to use our best Endeavours to procure Amendments to the System previous to its Adoption– To accomplish this desireable Event it is of Importance that those States who have not yet acceded to the Plan should open a Correspondence, and maintain a Communication–That they should understand one another on the Subject and unite in the Amendments they propose– With this View we address you on the Subject and request a free Correspondence may be opened between such Gentlemen in your State5 as are of Opinion with us on the Subject of Amendments–We request your Opinion on the Matter and that you would state such Amendments as you judge necessary to be made. We think it would conduce very much to promote Union and prevent Discord and an Hostile Disposition among the States, if a Correspondence could be brought about between the Conventions of your State, New Hampshire and this, who we presume will be in Session at the same time–We have the highest Hopes that such a Measure would produce the happiest Effects–We shall write to New Hampshire and propose it and wish your Convention may be inclined to agree to it6—We have every Reason to believe it will be agreeably to ours.7— It is not yet declared who are the Members elected for our Convention. The Ballots are to be counted the last Teusday in this Month8—But by the best Information received from the different Counties we [1101]have not a Doubt of there being a decided9 Majority returned who will be10 opposed to the Constitution in its present Form. A number of the leading and influential11 Characters who will compose the Opposition in our Convention are associated with us. We are anxious to form a Union with our Friends in the other States, and to manifest to the Continent and to the World, that our Opposition to this Constitution does not arise from an Impatience under the Restraint of good Government from local or State Attachments, from interested Motives or Party Prejudice12–but from the purer Sentiments of the Love of Liberty, an Attachment to Republican Principles and an Adherence to those Ideas which prevailed at the Commencement of the late Revolution, and which animated the most illustrious Patriots to undertake and persevere in the glorious but arduous Contest. In behalf of the federal republican Committee I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedt. Servant John Lamb Chairman PS.

Newspaper,No,Rusticus,,New York Journal,,5/23/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, In discussing the merits of the new constitution, one of the most favorite, and indeed one of the most plausible arguments the anti republicans adduce in support of their tenets is, the celebrity [1109]of the characters that composed the convention and their unanimity in signing the constitution–this, as the Plebeian well observes, “provokes to an investigation of characters which is an invidious task.”1 I believe, however, upon a candid investigation, we will be convinced that some of them, during the late war, “were hidden in the corners of obscurity,” some of them “speculating for fortune by sporting with the public money;” and that others are “more remarkable for their ambition and cunning than their patriotism;[”]–it would however be the height of injustice to deny the greatest merit to a few who signed the constitution–but the most knowing and patriotic may undesignedly do the greatest disservice to their country, and it is highly inconsistent with the dignity of a rational and independent man to give his implicit assent to a constitution of government, merely because it is gilded with the tinsel of great names. I think with Levy, that “a free people have no greater enemies than those who, created for the purpose of establishing a government for the good of the community, deprive the state of every part of its rights, who take away annual magistracy, and the certain vicissitude of authority without which equal liberty hath no existence.”2 As to the boasted unanimity of the Philadelphia convention, I shall only observe in the words of a judicious writer, that “unanimity is in itself an indifferent though a specious quality–Fools may be unanimous in the pursuit of a silly end, or of a right end by silly means. Knaves may be unanimous to cheat, pirates to plunder, assassins to destroy, even good men may be unanimous in a mistake–but it is not surely for wise or honest men who see the mistakes, the folly, the crimes, who felt the danger to be unanimous in supporting, because others have been so wicked, so unwise or unfortunate—as to be unanimous in committing them.” Goshen, Orange County, May 14."

They have no other way to evince their gratitude than by contributing an immediate reward and to petition the next setting of the Legislature to vote him a yearly allowance of ______ as a manifest token of the high sense they have for the honor such a character doth to America, and for the signal services he hath rendered them by his laudable, manly, ingenious detection of the disloyal principles of a person who it is possible otherways might have had a few votes for the office of a law maker.—But should the suspicions of some malicious persons be true (which is utterly impossible) who have slyly insinuated that Mr. Akin never said those words nor any thing like them; why then if this be true, why the Judge was but a little to blame.—They further say that as the good Judge was under a nomination to the same offices with Mr. Akin, it is probable to them the Judge was fearful whether Mr. Akin would not get the greatest number of suffrages, did he not take some timely measure to prevent it, and that this was the most likely method he could pitch upon—but as such a motive would have been unmanly and dishonorable, we hesitate not to pronounce it a most scandalous insinuation, and could never have been harboured by any person who had but only heard the name of JOSEPH CRANE, JUDGE.—I could therefore wish for the public to be persuaded against harbouring the least suspicion that Mr. Akin did not say those words, nor that they were by the manly (I cannot often enough repeat MANLY) Judge so rendered as to convey a worse meaning than what Mr. Akin intended to convey when he spoke them—but rather think with me, that they [1462]are abundantly palliated and upon the whole I firmly believe that Mr. Akin said three or four times as much as what the honorable and manly Judge thought proper to offer the public, and was I to offer my sentiments, I should think it very probable that the manly Judge hath suppressed many sentiments, which if made public, and which Mr. Akin then uttered would be sufficient to hang him, and that without any further proof than its coming with “I will attest to this.”—This circumstance is alone sufficient to convince any candid mind that the honorable, ingenious and manly Judge had no malice to Mr. Akin, but that his only motive for acquainting the public with just enough to let them know what a person they had nominated was to do the public a signal favor—and happy was it for us that the information came from so wonderful GOOD authority, otherwise it might possibly have been disputed; but thanks to the almost adorable Judge CRANE, it hath now had so good an effect that I am confident Mr. Akin had not a single vote in this county, and not more than five in the whole State. That Columbia may to the latest period enjoy such a distinguished blessing as the having one such a character as that of JOSEPH CRANE, in each State as a pattern for inferiors to endeavour to imitate, is the sincere and hearty prayer of PHILANDER.

Newspaper,No,Sydney,,New York Journal,,6/13/1788,"To THE Citizens of the State of New York. Although a variety of objections to the proposed new constitution for the government of the United States have been laid before the public by men of the best abilities, 1 am led to believe that rep- resenting it in a point of view which has escaped their observation may be of use, that is, by comparing it with the constitution of the State of New York The following contrast is therefore submitted to the public, to show in what instances the powers of the state government will be either totally or partially absorbed, and enable us to determine whether the remaining powers will, from those kind of pillars, be capable of supporting the mutilated fabric of a government, which even the advocates for the new constitution admit excels  the boasted models of Greece or Rome, and those of all other nations, in having precisely marked out the power of the government and the rights of the people. It may be proper to premise that the pressure of. necessity and distress (and not corruption) had a principal tendency to induce the adoption of the state constitutions and the existing confederation, that power was even then vested in the rulers with the greatest caution, and that, as from every circumstance we have reason to infer that the new constitution does not originate from a pure source, we ought deliberately to trace the extent and tendency of the trust we are about to repose, under the conviction that a re- assumption of that trust will at least be difficult, if not impracticable. If we take a retrospective view of the measures of Congress who have their secret journals, the conduct of their officers, at home and abroad, acting under an oath of secrecy, as well as of individuals who were intimately connected with them, from the year 1780 to the last convention, who also acted under an injunction of secrecy (and whose journals have not been published even to this day, but will no doubt continue buried in the dark womb of suspicious secrecy), we can scarcely entertain a doubt but that a plan has long since been framed to subvert the confederation ; that that plan has been matured with the most persevering industry and unremitted attention, and that the objects expressed in the preamble to the constitution, that is  to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, were merely the ostensible, and not the real reasons of its framers. That necessity and danger have been the moving causes to the establishment of the confederation will appear from the words of Congress recommending its formation to the several legislatures which are  under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength to maintain our common liberties. Let them be examined with liberality be- coming brethren and fellow-citizens, surrounded by the same iminent dangers, contending for the same illustrious prize, and deeply interested in being forever bound and connected together by the ties the most intimate and indissoluble. That these principles equally applied to the formation of our state constitution no person can seriously doubt who recollects the rapid progress of the British troops in this state and in Jersey in the year 1776, and the despondence which prevailed among the people on that occasion. The convention of this state, about that period, in explaining to the people the justice of the Ameri- can cause, addressed them as follows :  You and all men were created free and authorised to establish civil government for the preservation of our rights against civil oppression, and the security of that freedom which God had given you, against the rapacious hand of tyranny and lawless power. If then God hath given as freedom, are we not responsible to him for that as well as other talents ? If it is our birth-right, let us not sell it for a mess of pottage, nor suffer it to be torn from us by the hand of violence. The omission of a bill of rights in this State has given occasion to an inference that the omission was equally warrantable in the constitution for the United States. On this it may be necessary to observe that while the constitution of this State was in agitation, there appeared doubts upon the propriety of the measure, from the peculiar situation in which the country then was ; our connection with Britain dissolved, and her government formally renounced — no substitute devised — all the powers of government avowedly temporary, and solely calculated for defence; it was urged by those in favor of a bill of rights that the power of the rulers ought to be circumscribed, the better to protect the people at large from the oppression and usurpation of their rulers. The English petition of rights, in the reign of Charles the First, and the bill of rights in the reign of king William, were mentioned as examples to support their opinions. Those in opposition ad- mitted that in established governments, which had an implied constitution, a declaration of rights might be necessary to pre- vent the usurpation of ambitious men, but that was not our situation, for upon the declaration of independence it had be- come necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority  under the former government should be totally suppressed, and all the power of government exerted under the authority of the people of the colonies ; that we could not suppose that we had an existing constitution or form of government, express or im- plied, and therefore our situation resembled a people in a state of nature, who are preparing to institute a government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness, and as such, the constitution to be formed would operate as a bill of rights. These and the like considerations operated to induce the convention of New York to dismiss the idea of a bill of rights, and the more especially as the legislative state officers being elected by the people at short periods, and thereby rendered from time to time liable to be displaced in case of mal-conduct. But these reasons will not apply to the general government, because it will appear in the sequel that the state governments are considered in it as mere dependencies, existing solely by its toleration, and pos- sessing powers of which they maybe deprived whenever the general government is disposed so to do. If then the powers of the state governments are to be totally absorbed, in which all agree, and only differ as to the mode, whether it will be effected by a rapid progression, or by as certain, but slower, operations : what is to limit the oppression of the general government ? Where are 'the rights, which are declared to be incapable of violation ? And what security have people against the wanton oppression of unprincipled governors? No constitutional redress is pointed out, and no express declaration is contained in it, to limit the boundaries of their rulers ; beside which the mode and period of their being elected tends to take away their responsibility to the people over whom they may, by the power of the purse and the sword, domineer at discretion ; nor is there a power on earth to tell them, What dost thou ? or. Why dost thou so ? I shall now proceed to compare the constitution of the state of New York with the proposed federal government, distinguishing the paragraphs in the former, which are rendered nugatory by the latter ; those which are in a great measure enervated, and such as are in the discretion of the general government to permit or not. The 1st and 37th paragraphs of the constitution of the state of New York. The 1st  Ordains, determines, and declares that no authority shall on any pretence whatever be exercised over the people or members of this State, but such as shall be derived from and granted by them. The 37th,  That no purchases or contracts for the sale of lands with or of the Indians within the limits of this state, shall be binding on the Indians, or deemed valid, unless made under the authority and with the consent of the legislature of this state.'' I beg here to observe that the whole history of this spurious constitution for the government of the United States, from its origin to the present day, and the measures taken by Congress respecting the Indian affairs in this state, are a series of violations of these paragraphs, and of the 1 3th article of the confederation. It was a violation of the state constitution for the senate and assembly, on the 19th of February, 1787, to instruct their members to move in Congress for an act recommending a convention ; and it was also a violation of the 1 3th article of the confederation for Congress, on the 21st day February, to recommend a convention to the several legislatures. It was a further violation of the constitution of this state, by the senate and assembly, on the 27th day of March, to join and to appoint delegates to meet in convention, and it being done in that hasty, if not surreptitious manner, by joint resolutions, when acts of the least consequence, even for the yoking of hogs, require to be passed under the formalities of a law, makes it more glaringly so. It was an outrageous violation in the convention on the 17th of September, 1787, to attempt a. consolidation of the union, and utterly destroy the confederation and the sovereignty of particular states, when their powers were restricted  to the sole and express purpose of revising and amending the confederation It was again an infringement of the 1 3th article in the confederation, for Congress, on the 28th of September, not to arrest and prevent its being transmitted to the several legislatures ; nor was the legislature of this state less culpable, in the beginning of February, 1788, who, in the course of three hours, took up and concluded the measure of calling a convention without apprising their constituents of the danger. It is notorious that the right of regulating Indian affairs, especially with the five nations, has been in the colony of New York since the year 1664, and before that period, from the year 1614, whilst it was called New Nederland under the Dutch. That by the confederation, although Congress are invested with the power of regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians, that they are restricted to those Indians  not members of any of the states, and a special proviso that the legislative rights of any state within its own limits be not infringed or violated. It there- fore was a violation of the confederation and of the rights of the state for the congressional commissioners of Indian affairs to treat, at fort Stanwix, with and thereat to make a purchase from the five nations without the authority or consent of the legislature of this state. It was an infraction of the rights of the citizens of this state, and an insult on their government, for those commissioners to wrest private property from individuals, imprison their persons, set at defiance the civil authority of the county of Montgomery, and violently to resist the execution of legal process. Nor was the ordinance of the /th of August, 1786, for the regulation of Indian affairs, less so, namely, that  the Indian department be divided into two districts, viz.: the southern, which shall comprehend within its limits all the nations in the territory of the United States, who reside to the southward of the Ohio ; and the northern, which shall comprehend all the nations within the said territory, and westward, not of lake Ontario, but of Hudson's river; that a superintendent for the northern districts shall have authority to appoint two deputies to reside in such places as shall best facilitate the regulation of the Indian trade; that no person, citizen or other, under the penalty of five hundred dollars, shall reside among or trade with any Indian or Indian nations within the territory of the United States, without a licence for that purpose first obtained from the superintendent of the district, or of one of the deputies, who is hereby directed to give such licence to every person who shall produce from the supreme executive of any state a certificate under the seal of the state, that he is of good character and suitably qualified and provided for that employ- ment, for which licence he shall pay for one year the sum of fifty dollars to the said superintendent for the use of the United States. If this was the conduct of Congress and their officers, when possessed of powers which were declared by them to be insufficient for the purposes of government, what have we reason- ; ably to expect will be their conduct when possessed of the I powers  to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among I the several states, and with the Indian tribes, when they are armed with legislative, executive and judicial powers, and their laws the supreme laws of the land — and when the states are prohibited, without the consent of Congress, to lay any  imposts or duties on imports, and if they do they shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States – and all such laws subject to the revision and control of Congress. It is therefore evident that this state, by adopting the new government, will enervate their legislative rights, and totally surrender into the hands of Congress the management and regulation of the Indian trade to an improper government, and the traders to be fleeced by iniquitous impositions, operating at one and the same time as a monopoly and a poll-tax. The deputy by the above ordinance, has a right to exact yearly fifty .dollars from every trader, which Congress may increase to any amount, and give it all the operation of a monopoly ; fifty dollars on a cargo . of 10,000 dollars' value will be inconsiderable, on a cargo of lOOO dollars burthensome, but on a cargo of lOO dollars will be intolerable, and amount to a total prohibition, as to small adventurers. The second paragraph provides  that the supreme legislative power within this state shall be vested in two separate and dis- tinct bodies of men, the one to be called the assembly, and the other to be called the senate of the state of New York, who together shall form the legislature. The ninth provides  that the assembly shall be the judge of their own members, and enjoy the same privileges, and proceed in doing business in like manner as the assembly of the colony of New York of right formerly did. The twelfth paragraph provides ' that the senate shall, in like manner, be judges of their own members/' etc. The 31st describes even the stile of laws — that the stile of all laws shall be as follows :  Be it enacted by the people of the state of New York represented in senate and assembly, and that all writs and proceedings shall run in the name of the people of the state of New York, and tested in the name of the chancellor or the chief judge from whence they shall issue. The third provides against laws that may be hastily and inadvertently passed, inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution and the public good, and that the governor, the chancellor and judges of the supreme court, shall revise all bills about to be passed into laws, by the legislature. The powers vested in the legislature of this state by these paragraphs will be weakened, for the proposed new government declares that  all legislative powers therein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States, which shall consist of a seriate and a house of representatives, and it further prescribes, that  this constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding ; and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States arid of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution. Those who are full of faith, suppose that the words in pursuance thereof are restrictive, but if they reflect a moment and take into consideration the comprehensive expressions of the instrument, they will find that their restrictive construction is unavailing, and this is evinced by 1st art., 8 sect., where this government has a power  to lay and collect all taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States, and also to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof Art 1st, sect. 7, provides a qualified negative, that is, that  every bill which shall be passed [by] the house of representatives and the senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the president of the United States To conclude my observations on this head, it appears to me as impossible that these powers in the state constitution and those in the general government can exist and operate together, as it would be for a man to serve two masters whose interests clash, and secure the approbation of both. Can there at the same time and place be and operate two supreme legislatures, executives, and judicials ? Will a  guarantee of a republican form of government to every state in the union be of any avail, or secure the establishment and retention of state rights ? If this guarantee had remained, as it was first reported by the committee of the whole house, to wit, ...that a republican constitution, and its existing laws, ought to be guaranteed to each state by the United States, it would have been substantial ; but the changing the word constitution into the word form bears no favorable appearance. The fourth provides, that the assembly of the state of New York shall consist of at least seventy members, to be annually chosen in the several counties in certain proportions. The 5th, 1 2th and l6th, declare that a census shall be taken every seven years, to regulate the augmentation of the number seventy, so as not to exceed three hundred. Here seventy members are di- vided among the several counties, and consequently into at least as many poles and sets of members to be annually chosen. If this is contrasted with the constitution for the federal government — the constitutional assembly or house of representatives will be found to consist of sixty-five members divided among thirteen states, to be chosen every second year. Six for the state of New York ; not distributed among the counties, but by all the counties. And, although  the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof, yet, as it provides that  Congress may at any time by law,, make or alter those regulations, except as to places of chusing senators — the power in the state government to prescribe rules in those cases will be superseded by the executive of the general government, perhaps to the great inconvenience of the people. FROM THE VITH TO THE XIITH. The sixth paragraph recites that an opinion hath long prevailed among divers of the good people of this state that the voting at the election by ballot would tend more to preserve the liberty and equal freedom of the people than voting viva voce ; to the end, therefore, that a fair experiment be made which of these two methods of voting is to be preferred, it declares that after the war elections shall be by ballot. The seventh and eighth regulate the freeholds, and what property shall entitle a man to vote ; the ninth, the mode of conducting business in the assembly, and their privileges ; the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, the number of the senate, and how and by whom they shall be elected. As these clauses regulate the mode of elections and qualifications of the voters of senate and assembly, a relation of what gave rise to the provisions for voting by ballot and that of the value of the freehold, will help to unravel what otherwise may appear mysterious. In respect to the first it may be necessary to observe that under the colonial government there existed violent parties, not known by the name of whig or tory — republicans and aristocrats. Those who were in the employments of government, or the ins, were for extending the prerogative of the crown, while the outs were checks to it. Many of the leaders on both sides were under strong expectations that sooner or later that branch of colonial government called the king's council would be erected into a hereditary house of lords. The ins being nearest to the disposition of the offices of honor and profit, and in the way of obtaining patents for va- cant lands, and being from time to time joined by other crown officers and dependents, who flocked to and settled in this colony since the year 1763, had the means of making use of undue influence to retain their situations, which made the outs at last dispair of ever having a turn, unless the elections were by ballot. This opinion was propagated in every part of the colony before and at the time of the revolution, and so strongly did it operate upon the committee that were ordered to consider of and report the constitution, that at one time they had the whole system interwoven in the draft; but either because it would have made it too lengthy, or that one of the parties were then reduced, and not likely to rise again into importance, about the time the draft was reported, it was struck out and was left by the constitution to the legislature to decide, as experience on the exercise of both principles should suggest."
Newspaper,No,Sydney,,New York Journal,,6/14/1788,"To THE Citizens of the State of New York. (Concluded from yesterday's paper.) As to the value of the freeholds, there has been great diversity of opinions, for notwithstanding all agreed that the rights and liberties of a country were ever in danger from the rich and poor, and their safety in the middle sort or yeomanry of the country, still the difficulty occurred in establishing the mean. While the convention, in 1776, was setting at Harlem, the out- lines of a constitution were handed about, to try, it was supposed, the temper of the members, in which it was proposed to have a governor, lieutenant governor, senate, and assembly j the qualification of the governor, lieutenant governor, and senate, to be that each should possess real estate to the value of 10,000 pounds, and to be elected by freeholders possessing freeholds to the value of 1,000 pounds. Although this was not attended with bad effects, yet the qualifications of the electors gave rise to various arguments, and, among others, that as taxation and representation ought to go together, so the right of electing shall be in proportion to the value of each man's estate. To exemplify this, a man of 100 estate had one vote ; a man of 1000 should have ten, and a man of ten thousand pounds a hundred, and so on in the same ratio. Others on the contrary supposed that there ought to be no other criterion than the age of twenty-one, a citizen born and resident in this country ; out of the two extremes was produced the present system of election and qualification, both admitted to be as secure and consistent rights as any that have been contrived. It is apprehended, from the duplicity in the wording of 1st art, 4th sec, that seemingly to leave in the power of the respective legislatures to regulate the elections, and still, that Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations ; and the undesigned wording of the sixth article, that the constitution and laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding, will render the whole system ineffectual, if not nugatory, and a new system as destructive to the liberties of the citizens as that of the ratio of voices to the ratio of property introduced. Be- sides being liable to have the whole State erected into one district, and consequently may give rise to the inconveniences I mentioned before.

The 35th adopts, under certain exceptions and modifications, the common law of England, the statute law of England and Great Britain, and the acts of the legislature of the colony, which together formed the law on the 19th of April, 1775. 'The 41st provides  that the trial by jury remain inviolate for- ever; that no acts of attainder shall be passed by the legislature of this State for crimes other than those committed before the termination of the present war. And that the legislature shall at no time hereafter institute any new courts but such as shall proceed according to the course of the common law. There can be no doubt that if the new government be adopted in all its latitude, every one of these paragraphs will become a dead letter : nor will it solve any difficulties, if the United States guarantee  to every state in the union a republican form of government; we ma)' be allowed the form and not the substance, and that it was so intended will appear from the changing the word constitution to the word form and the omission of the words, and its existing laws. And I do not even think it uncharitable to sup- pose that it was designedly done ; but whether it was so or not, by leaving out these words the jurisprudence of each state is left to the mercy of the new government. By ist art., 8th sec, ist clause,  The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, - imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States. By the 9th clause of the same section,  To constitute tribunals inferior to the court. By the i8th clause, To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department thereof. The 3d art., ist sec,  The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.!' By sec. 2nd,  The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity To have in various instances an original and exclusive, in others a concurrent jurisdiction, and the supreme court in many cases an appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact. It provides, indeed, that the trial for crimes shall be by jury, but has left the trial in civil matters to the mercy of construction and their own legislative sovereign will and pleasure. By the 3d art., 3d sec,  The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder shall work a corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted. By ist art., 9th sec, 3d clause,  No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed. XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXIII, XL. The 17th orders  That the supreme executive power and authority of this State shall be vested in a governor. By the i8th he is commander-in-chief of the militia and admiral of the navy of the State; may grant pardons to all persons convicted of crimes ; he may suspend the execution of the sentence in treason or murder. By the 19th paragraph he is to see that the laws and resolutions of the legislature be faithfully executed. By the 27th he is president of the council of appointment, and has a casting vote and the commissioning of all officers. The 20th and 21st paragraphs give the lieutenant-governor, on the death, resignation, removal from office, or impeachment of the governor, all the powers of a governor. The 40th paragraph orders that the militia at all times, both in peace and war, shall be armed and disciplined, and kept in readiness ; in what manner the Quakers shall be excused; and that a magazine of warlike stores be forever kept at the expence of the State, and by act of the legislature, established, maintained, and continued in every county in the State. Whoever considers the following powers vested in the government, and compares them with the above, must readily perceive they are either all enervated or annihilated.  By the ist art, 8th sec, 15th, i6th and 17th clauses, Congress will be empowered to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions ; to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, for the governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, and for the erection of forts, magazines, etc. And by the 2nd art, 2d sec,  The president shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States when called into actual service of the United States, except in cases of impeachment. And by the 6th art.,  The members of the several state legislatures, and all the executive and judicial officers; both of the United States, and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support the constitution. Can this oath be taken by those who have already taken one under the constitution of this state ? XVIII, SEC. 17 ; XIX, SEC. 17 ; xx. sec. 17 ; xxi, sec. 17 ; xxiii, sec. 17 ; XXII TO XXX inclusive. These paragraphs regulate the election, appointment, construction and duration of all the state, county and district officers, including the delegates to Congress, and how they severally are to be created and commissioned. The 22d directs that the treasurer shall be appointed by act of the legislature to originate with the assembly. The 23d establishes a council to appoint the officers. The 24th directs that the military officers shall be, during the pleasure of the council, the chancellor, judges of the supreme court, the first judge in every county until the age of 60. Twenty-five and 28, which offices are incompatible, and the tenure and duration of such officers. Twenty-six, that sheriffs and coroners be annually appointed, and shall not continue more than four years. Twenty-seven, that the officers of the court be appointed by the respective courts, except the attorneys, by the first judge of every court. Twenty-nine, provides that town clerks, supervisors, assessors, constables and collectors, and all other officers heretofore elegible by the people, shall always continue to be so elegible. Thirty, directs the mode how the delegates to represent this state in the general Congress of the United States shall be elected. I apprehend that the paragraphs aforesaid will be compleatly rendered unoperative by the following articles in the new constitution : Second article, second section, second clause, the president  shall have power, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint embassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court, and all officers of the United States where appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law ; but the Congress may by law vest the power of such inferior officers as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. By the ist art, 8 section, 9, 18 clauses. Congress have power  to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof By the third article, 2d section, there is an extensive federal power as above-mentioned. By the 2d article, 2d section, the president  shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and shall commission all the officers of the United States. From these powers lodged in Congress and the powers vested in the states, it is clear that there must be a government within a government, two legislative, executive and judicial powers. The power of raising an army in time of peace, and to command the militia, will give the president ample means to enforce the Supreme laws of the land. XXIII, SEC. 21 ; XXIV, SEC. 21 ; XXV, SEC. 21 ; XXVI, SEC. 21 ; XXVII, SEC. 21 ; XXVIII, SEC. 21 ; XXIX, SEC. 21 ; XXX, SEC. 21 ; XXXI, SEC. 2 ; XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV. The 32d paragraph orders,  That a court shall be instituted for the trial of impeachments and the correction of errors under the regulations which shall be established by the legislature, and to consist of the president of the senate for the time being, and the senators, chancellors and judges of the supreme court. The 33d vests the power of impeaching all officers of the state for mal and corrupt practice in the representatives of the people in assembly. The 34th allows the parties impeached or indicted for crimes and misdemeanors to have counsel. This system is undermined and rendered nugatory by 1st art., 6th and 7th clauses, where the senate in the new constitution, have the trial and judgment on all impeachments. By 3d art., 2d sec, 3d clause, the trial of all crimes is regulated. By the 3d art., 3d sec, it is defined what shall be treason, the proof required, the punishment, and how the judgment in attain- der shall operate. XXXIII, SEC. 32; XXXIV, SEC. 32 ; XXXV, SEC. 13; XXXVII, The 38th paragraph provides  that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious procession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever hereafter be allowed within this State to all mankind, provided that the .liberty of conscience hereby granted shall not excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of the State. The 39th provides that ' no minister of the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to or capable of holding any civil or military office or place within this state. The first of those articles protects us from persecution in religious matters. The other excludes the clergy from enjoying any office, civil or military. Two provisions passed by in silence by the framers of the new constitution ; and although possibly the leaders in both have been equally averse to a democratic system, and have had the same object, the ruin of state government, in view. This paragraph provides that it shall be in the discretion of the legislature to naturalize all such persons and in such manner as they shall think proper. The 1st .art, 8 sec, 4th clause, give to the new government power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. And by the 4th art., 2d sec,  the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, whereby the clause is rendered entirely nugatory. From this contrast it appears that the general government, when compleatly organized, will absorb all those powers of the state which the framers of its constitution had declared should be only exercised by the representatives of the people of the state ; that the burthens and expence of supporting a state establishment will be perpetuated; but its operations to ensure or contribute to any essential measures promotive of the happiness of the people may be totally prostrated, the general government arrogating to itself the right of interfering in the most minute objects of internal police, and the most trifling domestic concerns of every state, by possessing a power of passing laws  to provide for the general welfare of the United States, which may affect life, liberty and property in every modification they may think expedient, unchecked by cautionary reservations, and unrestrained by a declaration of any of those rights which the wisdom and prudence of America in the year 1776 held ought to be at all events protected from violation. In a word, the new constitution will prove finally to dissolve all the power of the several state legislatures, and destroy the rights and liberties of the people ; for the power of the first will be all in all, and of the latter a mere shadow and form without substance, and if adopted we may (in imitation of the Carthagenians) say, Delenda vit Americae.

Newspaper,No,,,New York Journal,,6/20/1788,"The consols or anti-republicans, who have assumed to themselves the appellation of federalists, observes a correspondent, still continue to display their mean weapons of falsehood, deception and detraction, in order farther to cajole and betray the honest yeomanry of our country into the horrid fangs of the new leviathan of power. For this purpose, paragraphs and extracts of letters, having no foundation on facts, are constantly formed, fabricated, and published in the various newspapers, stiled federal. Of this description we shall consider the extract in the Daily Advertiser of yesterday, from a gentleman in Philadelphia to his friend in this city, dated the 16th inst.2 It is there asserted, that Mr. Mason wrote to a friend of his in Philadelphia on the 7th of June, declaring, “that he thinks it will be carried against him in convention, &c.” But as our correspondent has great reason to doubt the truth of his declaration, it behoves the Philadelphia letter writer to procure and publish a full, fair, and candid extract from Mr. Mason’s letter, if he has written any on that day, otherwise it will be deemed as his own, not Mr. Mason’s declaration. Among other things, it is also asserted by the Philadelphia letter writer, that “the sanguine, promise a handsome majority,” and plumes himself much on the acquisition of “Mr. Zeph. Jackson, an esteemed anti-federalist from the back counties, to the federal party.”3 The cause of despotism must be desperate indeed in that quarter, if it rests on no better support than that of traitors and turn-coats. The state of public affairs at Richmond, will be found, continues our correspondent, to be nearly as follows: Mr. Mason and Mr. Henry take the lead of the anti-federalists—Mr. Maddison and Mr. Nicholas appear in the same point of view among the federalists—Both parties, even the most sanguine, declare it exceedingly difficult to determine which side the balance will incline. Some of the anti-federalists say, they have made a list of those on whom they can depend, and, after throwing six or eight doubtful characters into the other scale, have a majority of two in their favor—while some of their opponents report, that they have a majority of five or six. At any rate, neither party can boast of a “handsome majority.”4 But all parties seem to allow, that amendments to the new constitution are necessary and ought to be made. The great question or point in dispute will therefore be, in the convention of Virginia, whether those amendments shall be ingrafted into the constitution previous or subsequent to adoption? Nothing decidedly, our correspondent assures us, has hitherto been [1659]done in the convention, at Richmond, except agreeing to dissect the new monster, section by section; and the speakers have not yet departed from the generals either in the defence or the attack. The heroes, Maddison and Nicholas, on the part of the federalists, being indisposed, on the 9th of June, were unable to attend the house. On that day, Mr. Patrick Henry, in a most masterly and eloquent manner, pointed out the defects and snares of the new scheme, obviated the mighty bugbears raised to frighten and intimidate the weak and wavering into a speedy and implicit adoption, called in question the threats of the house of Bourbon, and the United Netherlands, now actually groaning under the tyranny and thraldom of a Stadtholder or Dutch president general, to make reprisals, and enforce the payment of their respective demands; and declared he would withhold his assent until all the poison and pollution were fully and satisfactorily extracted and cleansed from the proposed constitution, which he considered as a slavish system of arbitrary power, calculated to crush the spirit of freedom and destroy those inestimable privileges acquired by our glorious struggle with Great-Britain. To sign, seal and deliver that instrument (pointing to the new constitution) he observed, was in fact to surrender, in toto, the liberties of the people and the dearest rights of humanity, into the hands of a few designing, aristocratical despots; and to subscribe to it without previous amendments, would be like a man’s voluntarily suffering himself to be bound in fetters and chains and thrown into a dreary, offensive dungeon, and then seeking for relief and redress from the lordly and elective tyrants who would have the entire command and controul of the federal locks, keys and bolts. He arrested the serious attention of the house the greatest part of the day, having been upwards of three hours on the floor.5 Col. Henry Lee replied, but did not follow him through so extensive and general a view of the subject.6 Governor Randolph, whose treachery and dissimulation, on this occasion, is pretty generally reprobated by the people at large, next rose to answer some collateral reflections which he supposed was cast on him by Mr. Henry. But exhibiting in the face of that truly respectable assembly, strong and evident marks of embarrassment and perturbation of mind, he could only entreat that the next morning (Tuesday) might be assigned to him for his exculpation. In the course of his short, and incoherent reply, he said he was perfectly satisfied “to let their former friendships fall, like Lucifer’s, never to rise again,” and should be content hereafter, “to move in the humble sphere of a representative.”7 As the general court is to convene at Richmond on the 23d instant, and many of its members being also in convention, an adjournment [1660]in all probability will take place, at least until the rising of the legislature; so that from this view, there is every reason to believe, the important and interesting question relative to the constitution will not immediately be brought on in that convention. Let the wretched office-hunters, and friends to tyranny, in some of our cities and towns along the sea coast, therefore, suspend their preparations for another parade and procession of Federal-ships8 constructed on refugee and foreign bottoms. They may rest assured, the free and independent farmers of this great continent, are not to be influenced or led away by such idle, giddy puppet-shews and pantomine entertainments."

Newspaper,No,Philander,,Poughkeepsie County Journal,Atticus,7/1/1788,"To Atticus. Had I not suspected my entire silence at this time, would have been construed into a fear of that “other mode of defence,” I should have returned no answer to your performance.—I will now ask, why you could not have followed the heels of J. Crane’s certificate, as close as you did Philander’s piece? For certainly your’s was far more applicable to that than it was to this. Philander had no malice to J. Crane; whereas malice, and an invidious desire to lessen the number of Mr. Akin’s votes at the election, appear to have been the sole motives with the Judge, in publishing his certificate. He could have no other end in view, but to prejudice the minds of the people against Mr. Akin. I therefore think it might be justly called an insidious and ignominious attempt. You are pleased to say, that, “the very leading features of my performance, appear to have been coined at the mint of malicious envy.” I will only say, that in this, dear sir, you are grossly mistaken—you further say, that “prudence, and decency, ought to have taught me to behold this affair with silence.” Now, although the gentleman whose character Mr. Crane endeavoured (& but endeavoured) to injure, thought the certificate unworthy of further notice than what he gave it.—Yet might [1465]not the entire silence of this county have been construed into a tacit confession of the truth of the charge exhibited against him, by those who were unacquainted with the character of both gentlemen? You also add, “that I ought to have confined myself to a candid investigation, how far the charge exhibited against my favorite politician was just[”]: I assure you that I did; and my piece was not wrote until I had satisfied myself in that particular: And it still remains with forcible conviction on my mind, that Mr. Crane very materially misrepresented the discourse that passed between him and Mr. Akin at that time; and this perhaps may be considered but as a softer name for a falsehood; for in what doth a falsehood essentially consist, but in endeavouring to make a person believe that for truth which in reality is not? And therefore I think I am warranted to say the charge was unjust, unmanly, and that it evidently “appeared to have been coined at the mint of malicious envy.” I think present circumstances sufficiently evince, that my “favorite politician’s” conduct hath been so favorable to his innocence, as to stand in no need of a justification with those who were acquainted with the character from whence the charge published against him proceeded. There are people in the world my friend Atticus, whose characters suffer loss upon a candid investigation; such people whether they are Judges, Colonels, Captains, or Lieutenants, generally think it for their honor, to keep the lighted candle still under a bushel:1 for this reason (although I perfectly recollect that my name is left with the Printer) I fear not the use which may be made of it, even was your other mode of defence to be adopted. Dutchess county, June 15th, 1788."
Letter,Yes,Nathaniel Lawrence,John Lamb,,,7/3/1788,"The bearer (Major Sally)2 is an intimate friend of Judge Platt’s3 who gives him an high character as a gentleman of probity & politeness—The Governor requested me to give him this letter to you & to request of you the favor to introduce him to Mrs. Clinton—As I write in great haste I can only tell you that the information from Virginia seems to have no effect on Us, tho it has on the other party which they have discovered to day by changing their plan of defence—You have heard no doubt that they have disputed every inch of ground but to day they have quietly suffered us to propose our amendments without a word in opposition to them—What their object is I know not, but I will do myself the pleasure of informing you as soon as it is discovered.…"
Newspaper,No,Leonidas,,New York Journal,,7/3/1788,"Mr. Greenleaf, The following extract, from a London paper of April 1st, entitled, “The Times,” will shew, that the anti-federals (so called) are not singular in their predictions of what will be the probable consequence of the new government, unless amended previous to adoption.           Libertas. NEW GOVERNMENT of AMERICA. In the new Constitution for the future government of the Thirteen United States of America, the President and Senate have all the executive and two thirds of the Legislative power. This is a material deviation from those principles of the English Constitution for which they fought with us, and in all good governments, it should be a fundamental maxim, that, to give a proper balance to the political system, the different branches of the legislature should be unconnected, and the legislative and executive powers should be separate. By the new constitution of America this union of the executive and legislative bodies operates in the most weighty matters of the state:—They jointly make all treaties—they jointly appoint all officers civil and military; and, they jointly try all impeachments, either of their own members, or of the officers appointed by themselves. In this formidable combination of power, there is no responsibility;—and where there is power without responsibility, how can there be liberty. The president of the senate is elected for four years, and each of the thirteen states has one vote at his election; which vote is not of the people; but of electors two degrees from the people. The senate is a body of six years duration; and as in the choice of presidents, the largest state has but one vote, so it is in the choice of senators. Now this shews, that responsibility is as little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from the terror of impeachment: for to the members of the senate it is clear, that trial by impeachment is nothing but parade. From such an union in governments, it requires no great depth of political knowledge to prophecy, that monarchy or aristocracy, must be generated, and perhaps of the most grievous kind. The only check in favor of the democratic principle is, the house of representatives; but this smallness of number, and great comparitive disparity of power, render that house of little effect to promote good or restrain bad government. The power given to this ill constructed senate is, to judge of what may be for the general welfare, and such engagements, when made the acts of congress, become the supreme laws of the land. This is a power co-extensive with every possible object of human legislation: yet there is no restraint, no charter of rights, no residuum of human privileges, not intended to be given up to society. The rights of conscience,—the freedom of the press,—and trial by jury; are at the mercy of this senate. Trial by jury, has been already materially injured:—The trial in criminal cases is not by twelve men of the vicinage, or of the county, but of the state, and the states are from fifty to seven hundred miles in extent! In criminal cases this new system says, the trial shall be by jury:—On civil cases it is silent; then it is fair to infer, that as in criminal cases it has been materially impaired, in civil cases it may be altogether omitted. But it is in truth strongly discountenanced in civil cases; for this new system gives the supreme court, in matters of appeal, jurisdiction both of law and fact. This being the beginning of American Freedom, it is very clear the ending will be slavery, for it cannot be denied, that this constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously oligarchic; and it is every where agreed, that a government administered by a few, is, of all governments, the worst."
Letter,No,John Lamb,Nathaniel Lawrence,,,7/6/1788,"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 3rd. Instant per Major Sally; to whom I shall pay particular attention; and will not fail to introduce him to our Friends here. I am much obliged to you, for the communication, contained in your Letter; as it affords me much pleasure, to find, that, the Patriots in our Convention, stand firm—And I flatter myself, they will remain so, in spight of their Opponents endeavours to disunite them. You will see in the Hands of the Governor, a Letter from So. Carolina; from which you will be able to form a judgment, of the disposition, of the people in that State.2 Mrs. Lamb, & the rest of my Family, join me in kind Compliments to Mrs. Lawrence, and yourself. I am, with every sentiment of Friendship & Esteem Dear Sir Your Obdt. Servt"
Letter,No,Abraham G Lansing,Abraham Yates Jr.,,,7/9/1788,"On sunday Evening I sent you a Circumstantial account of the difference which interrupted the Harmony of the Federalists on Friday, since that Time nothing has occurred worth communicating2—Our Friends in the Country are much Hurt and irritated—and we have had several in to see us—and we have uniformily recommended them to be peaceable and quiet—that the quarrel which we had in this City was unintentional on our side—and would not have happened had our Friends and their antoganists not been heated with Liquor—this reasoning has every effect we wish—and they Leave us well satisfied By this Evening’s Stage we have received some Accounts from our Friends, which Savor much of division among them respecting the mode of introducing the Amendments, we apprehend that the Delay occasioned by the length of the Business will be productive of much Inconvenience if not a total disappointment, to our Friends who wish to promote the True Interests of our Country—what the Event may be is rendered exceedingly doubtful—At all points I hope it will be well considered and that if the Constitution is adopted the Amendments will be so interwoven with it that the one will not work without the other. Our Committee3 have this Moment sent for me to read the Letters which I have received.—The Family are all well and desire their respectful Compliments to you— I am yours affectionately [P.S.] The people that were hurt are all conceived out of Danger—"
Letter,Yes,Abraham G Lansing,Abraham Yates Jr.,,,7/20/1788,"This afternoon to our great surprise and Mortification Mr. Swart2 arrived from Poghkepsie, which place he left yesterday 10 oClock—he brought us Intelligence that a Motion for adjournment would be brought Forward yesterday and that it was expected to be carried by a Majority—If this Measure should take place, all the Exertions we have made and the anxiety we have experienced for the Liberty of our Country will end in nothing—much as it is against my wish to adopt the Constitution without previous amendments—I should prefer the Virginia Form to an adjournment—for we will have to go over all the Ground of the Election again without any prospect of Success—The Baneful Manor Interest will be exerted to obtain Instructions to the Delegates, and the poor deluded well meaning Yeomanry of our Country, not having it in their power to follow the dictates of their own Consciences will be compelled to sign these Instructions to keep well with their Masters—our Friends in the City and Numbers in the Country—will decline signing Counter Instructions, by the Meaneauvers of the Federalists who will hold out every Circumstance they can, to alarm and Intimidate— our Friends will this Evening join in a Letter to our Delegates, and among other Matters recommend them by all Means to push the Business to a Close before they rise, and should the Constitution be adopted to place themselves in such Situation as to shew their Constituents in whom to place Confidence in Future3— Mr. Jones it is said is so much Intimidated by the Threats of the Federalists that he does not any more take an active part—M. Smith is Likewise charged with some improper Steps—I cannot give Credit to what is alledged—but if it is True he has injured the Cause of our Country more than any Federalist— If an adjour[n]ment should take place—our Friends recommend [1331]you not to return to this place without giving them previous Notice—for if you return immediately after it will be construed into a determination in you to exert yourself—and by that means draw the particular resentment of the whole Federal Junto on you.… PS. If the Convention does not adjourn Swart has engaged to be down again on Wednesday next—"
