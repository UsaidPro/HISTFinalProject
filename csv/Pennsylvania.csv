Letter,No,David Reddick,William Irvine,,,9/24/1787,"The new plan of government proposed by the Convention has made a bustle in the city and its vicinity. All people, almost, are for swallowing it down at once without examining its tendencies. I have thought it unsafe within the wind of hurricane to utter a syllable about it: but to you sir I may venture to say that, in my opinion, the day on which we adopt the present proposed plan of government, from that moment we may justly date the loss of American liberty. Perhaps my fears hath contributed principally to this opinion. I will change the moment that I see better. My dear sir, why is not the liberty of the press provided for? Why will the Congress have power to alter the plan or mode of choosing Representatives? Why will they have power to lay direct taxes? Why will they have power to keep standing armies in time of peace? Why will they have power to make laws in direct contradiction to the forms of government established in the several states? Why will they have power to collect by law ten dollars for every German or Irishman which may come to settle in America? Why is the trial by jury destroyed in civil causes before Congress? And, above all, I cannot imagine why the people in this city are so very anxious to have it adopted instantly before it can be digested or deliberately considered. If you were only here to see and hear those people, to observe the means they are using to effect this purpose, to hear the Tories declare they will draw their sword in its defense, to see the Quakers running about signing declarations and petitions in favor of it before they have time to examine it, to see gentlemen running into the country and neighboring towns haranguing the rabble. I say were you to see and hear these things as I do you would say with me that the very soul of confidence itself ought to change into distrust. If this government be a good one or even a tolerable one, the necessities and the good sense of America will lead us to adopt it; if otherwise give us time and it will be amended and then adopted; but I think the measures pursued here is a strong evidence that these people know it will not bear an examination and therefore wishes to adopt it first and consider it afterward. I hope Congress will be very deliberate and digest it thoroughly before they send it recommended to the states. I sincerely hope that such gentlemen as were members of Convention and who have seats in Congress may not be considered as very proper judges of their own works. I pray a spirit of wisdom and a spirit of integrity pervade Congress, more especially at this time."
Letter,No,Daniel Shay,Antifederalist Junto,,,9/26/1787,"My dear Friends, It is with great concern that I have heard that you are composed of only five members, and that a great body of citizens who once followed you in every thing, have lately joined the federal party. Rest assured, they never were sound at bottom, that is, they never were attached to themselves above all things, or they never would have left you at this trying juncture.3 My advice to you upon this occasion is, give the new government all the opposition that lies in your power. For this purpose, if you are applied to to sign a petition to your Assembly to recommend the adoption of it,�you must say �you have not read it;� or if you have, that �you want time to consider of it.� Besides this, you must snarle at the Convention in every company, and write letters to the frontier countries, where the people is most easily deceived, and alarm them with a number of hard words, such as aristocracy, monarchy, oligarchy, and the like, none of which they will understand. You must tell them further, that by the constitution of Pennsylvania, which you are sworne to support (and no wonder, for its treasury supports you) the federal government cannot be adopted in Pennsylvania.4 Even the people themselves cannot consent to any alterations of the constitution; for the constitution is above them all, and above every thing else, except you, five gentlemen, who live by it, and who may break it, and twist it, and turn it when ever it suits your interest and party. You must try further to put off the recommendation of a Convention, till the next session of your Assembly. This will give you time to look about you, and perhaps to throw a lock upon one of the wheels of the great continental waggon; for you may depend upon it your wheelbarrow, and the new flying machine, cannot long travel the same road together. With great regard, and sincere wishes for your success in every thing that tends to anarchy, distress, poverty, and tyranny, I am your friend and humble servant, DANIEL SHAYS."
Newspaper,No,Tullius,,Freeman's Journal,,9/26/1787,"The writer of the following remarks has the happiness and respectability of the United States much at heart, and it is with pleasure he has seen a system promulged by the late Convention, which promises to insure those blessings. But as perfection is not the lot of human nature, we are not to expect it in the new Federal Constitution. Candor must confess, however, that it is a well-wrought piece of stuff, and claims, upon the whole, the approbation of all the states. Our situation is critical, and demands our immediate care. It is therefore to be hoped that every state will be speedy in calling a convention�speedy because the business is momentous and merits the utmost deliberation. The following strictures on the proposed Constitution are submitted with diffidence. Excepting a single instance, they regard points of an inferior magnitude only; and as the writer is not possessed of any of the reasons which influenced the Convention, he feels the more diffident in offering these. Remarks Article I. section 2 (3d clause). �The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000.� If we consider the vast extent and increasing population of the United States, it will appear that a representation upon this principle (though proper to begin with) cannot last very long. It must grow far too unwieldy for business and the Constitution must therefore be mended and patched with new work. Let your government be invariably fixed; so far, at least, as human foresight can go, and age will secure it respect and veneration from the multitude. In framing a government, we should consider a century to come as but a day, and leave the least possible for posterity to mend. Errors sanctified by long usage are not easily relinquished. Their age attaches the people and renders a reform difficult. There is even danger in reforming the errors of a government, but there is more in letting them alone. Hence we ought to aim at PERMANENCY in every part of a constitution intended to endure. In America representation ought to be in a ratio with population, and this should be provided for in the government of the United States. Section 4 (1st clause). �The times, places, and manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing Senators.� A general uniformity of acting in confederation (whenever it can be done with convenience) must tend to federalize (allow me the word) the sentiments of the people. The time, then, might as well have been fixed in Convention�not subject to alteration afterwards. Because a day may be chosen by Congress which the constitution or laws of a state may have appropriated to local purposes, not to be subverted or suspended. Leaving the places subject to the alteration of Congress may also lead to improper consequences and (humanum est errare) tempt to sinister views. Who in Pennsylvania would think it advisable to elect Representatives on the shore of Lake Erie; or even at Fort Pitt? Second clause. �The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December.� Here is a kind of solecism; as the late period of assembling hardly admits of a prorogation and reassembling in the same year. But as probably a federal year is meant, it should have been so expressed. December is an objectionable month, too, for the representatives of so many distant states to meet in; the depth of winter forbids the convenience of water, and the communication by land is expensive, inconvenient, and often obstructed at this season. Much time would necessarily be lost in bringing the members together. Section 9 (22d clause). �No Capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless,� etc. I confess here a great disappointment. When I began to read this clause, I did not doubt that the poll tax would [148page icon]share the fate of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder. I am sorry to find myself mistaken. For a capitation tax is impolitic and unjust; it is a tax upon population, and falls indiscriminately upon the poor and the rich; the helpless, who cannot work, and the robust, who can. The poll taxes of the Eastern States have forced many thousands of their valuable citizens to emigrate. and made those disaffected who stayed behind. Article 3. section 2 (3d clause). �The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by Jury.� I sincerely wish the Convention had said, a �Jury� of THIRTEEN, a MAJORITY of whom shall determine the verdict. Is it not extravagantly absurd to expect that twelve men shall have but one opinion among them upon the most difficult case? Common sense revolts at the idea, while conscience shudders at the prostitution of an oath thus sanctified by law! Starve, or be perjured! say our courts. The monstrous attachment of the people to an English jury shows how far the force of prejudice can go and the encomiums which have been so incessantly lavished upon it should caution us against borrowing from others, without the previous conviction of our own minds."
Broadside,No,"James M'Calmont, Robert Clark, Jacob Miley, Alexander Wright, John M'Dowell, John Flenniken, James Allison, Theophilus Philips, John Gilchrist, Abraham Smith, Robert Whitehill, David Mitchel, John Piper, Samuel Dale, William Findley, James Barr",,,,9/29/1787,"Gentlemen: When in consequence of your suffrages at the last election we were chosen to represent you in the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, we accepted of the important trust, with a determination to execute it in the best manner we were able, and we flatter ourselves we acted in such a manner as to convince you, that your interests with that of the good of the state has been the object of our measures. During the fall and spring sessions of the legislature, on the recommendation of the Congress of the United States, your representatives proceeded to the appointment of delegates to attend a convention to be held in the city of Philadelphia, for the purposes of revising and amending the present Articles of Confederation, and to report their proceedings to Congress, and when adopted by them, and ratified by the several states to become binding on them as part of the Confederation of the United States. We lamented at the time that a majority of our legislature appointed men to represent this state who were all citizens of Philadelphia, none of them calculated to represent the landed interest of Pennsylvania, and almost all of them of one political party, men who have been uniformly opposed to that constitution for which you have on every occasion manifested your attachment. We were apprehensive at the time of the ill consequences of so partial a representation, but all opposition was in vain. When the Convention met, members from twelve states attended and, after deliberating upwards of four months on the subject, agreed on a plan of government which was sent forward by them to Congress, and which was reported to the House by the delegates of Pennsylvania as mere matter of information, and printed in the newspapers of the city of Philadelphia; but the House had not received it officially from Congress, nor had we the least idea that, as the annual election was so near, we should be called upon to deliberate, much less to act on so momentous a business; a business of the utmost importance to you�and your posterity. We conceived it required the most minute examination and mature consideration, and that it ought to be taken up by the next house. Judge then of our surprise on finding the last day but one in the sessions, a member of the House who had been a delegate in the Convention, without any previous notice or any intimation of his intentions to the House, offer a resolution recommending the calling a convention to consider of the proposed Constitution, and to direct the electing members for the same, at so early a period as the day of your annual election, thus attempting to surprise you into a choice of members�to approve or disapprove of a Constitution, which is to entail happiness or misery forever without giving time to the greatest part of the state even to see, much less to examine the plan of government. Our duty to ourselves and our regard for your dearest interests induced us to oppose the measure by every possible argument that we could suggest at the time; but all our efforts were insufficient even to produce a postponement until the afternoon. We urged and urged in vain the constant practice of the House when any important business was to be brought on, of giving previous notice and making it the order of the day sometime beforehand; that no bill however trifling was passed without three readings, and without this formality which gave the members time and opportunity to think on the subject; that the rules were adhered to so strictly that even the building of a bridge, or the laying out a road, could not be determined on without this form; but this the most important of all matters was to be done by surprise and, as we conceived, with design to preclude you from having it in your power to deliberate on the subject. Our anxiety for your interests was great, but notwithstanding the firmest and most determined opposition, no respite could be obtained, and the first resolution was adopted by a majority of the House, when they adjourned till the afternoon to complete the business. In these circumstances we had no alternative; we were under a necessity of either returning to the House and, by our presence, enabling them to call a convention before our constituents could have the means of information or time to deliberate on the subject, or by absenting ourselves from the House, prevent the measure taking place. Our regard for you induced us to prefer the latter, and we determined not to attend in the afternoon. We conceived that at the time we were chosen you had no view to this business, and we could see no inconvenience nor loss of time from deferring a matter of such importance and which would in its consequences affect or, perhaps, annihilate our own constitution, as well as that of every constitution in the Union to a house chosen after the people had some knowledge of the plan, especially as the next house will meet at so early a period, and a convention could be called by them time enough to meet in a few months, which would be as early as any state in the Union and would be allowing you time to make up your minds on a matter which appeared to us to require so much deliberation. Thus circumstanced and thus influenced, we determined the next morning again to absent ourselves from the House, when James M�Calmont, Esquire, a member from Franklin, and Jacob Miley, Esquire, a member from Dauphin, were seized by a number of citizens of Philadelphia, who had collected together for that purpose; their lodgings were violently broken open, their clothes torn, and after much abuse and insult, they were forcibly dragged through the streets of Philadelphia to the State House, and there detained by force, and in the presence of the majority, who had, the day before, voted for the first of the proposed resolutions, treated with the most insulting language; while the House so formed proceeded to finish their resolutions, which they mean to offer to you as the doings of the legislature of Pennsylvania. On this outrageous proceeding we make no comment. The inhabitants of Franklin and Dauphin have been grossly insulted by the treatment of their members. We know the feelings of the people of these counties are sufficiently keen; it becomes us not to add to them by dwelling longer on the subject; but as our conduct may, and we have no doubt, will be misrepresented, we thought it our duty to lay before our constituents, to whom alone we are accountable, a real state of facts; that they may judge for themselves. We need not tell you, that we could have no interested motive to influence our conduct. A sense of that duty which we owed to you and to ourselves could have alone induced us to submit to the variety of abuse and insults which many of us have experienced, for not consenting to a measure that might probably have surprised you into a surrender of your dearest rights. Our conduct has at least had the good effect to lengthen out the time of election, and induced them to postpone the election for members of the convention until the first Tuesday in November next; whereas the resolution first proposed directed it to be holden for all the counties east of Bedford on the day of the annual election, nine days from the time of proposing the measure. We cannot conclude without requesting you to turn your serious attention to the government now offered to your consideration. �We are persuaded that a free and candid discussion of any subject tends greatly to the improvement of knowledge, and that a matter in which the public are so deeply interested cannot be too well understood. A good constitution and government is a blessing from heaven and the right of posterity and mankind; suffer then, we entreat you, no�interested motive, sinister view or improper influence to direct your determinations or bias your judgments.� Provide yourselves with the new Constitution offered to you by the Convention; look it over with attention that you be enabled to think for yourselves. We confess when the legislature appointed delegates to attend the Convention, our ideas extended no further than a revision or amendment of the present Confederation, nor were our delegates, by the acts of Assembly appointing them, authorized to do more as will appear by referring to the said act, the second section of which describes their powers in the following words, viz.: �2. Be it enacted, and it is hereby enacted by the representatives of the Freemen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met, and by the authority of the same, That Thomas Mifflin, Robert Morris, George Clymer, Jared Ingersoll, Thomas Fitzsimons, James Wilson and Governeur Morris, esquires, are hereby appointed deputies from this state to meet in the Convention of the deputies of the respective states of North America, to be held at the city of Philadelphia, on the second day of the month of May next. And the said Thomas Mifflin, Robert Morris, George Clymer, Jared Ingersoll, Thomas Fitzsimons, James Wilson and Governeur Morris, esquires, or any four of them are hereby constituted and appointed deputies from this state, with powers to meet such deputies as may be appointed and authorized by the other states to assemble in the said convention at the city aforesaid, and to join with them in devising, deliberating on, and discussing all such alterations and further provisions as may be necessary to render the foederal constitution fully adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and in reporting such act or acts for that purpose, to the United States in Congress assembled, as when agreed to by them, and duly confirmed by the several states, will effectually provide for the same.�2 You will therefore perceive that they had no authority whatever from the legislature to annihilate the present Confederation and form a constitution entirely new, and in doing which they have acted as mere individuals, not as the official deputies of this commonwealth. If, however, after mature deliberation, you are of opinion that the plan of government which they have offered for your consideration is best calculated to promote your political happiness and preserve those invaluable privileges you at present enjoy, you will no doubt choose men to represent you in convention who will adopt it; if you think otherwise you will, with your usual firmness, determine accordingly. You have a right, and we have no doubt you will consider whether or not you are in a situation to support the expense of such a government as is now offered to you, as well as the expense of your state government or whether a legislature consisting of three branches, neither of them chosen annually, and that the Senate, the most powerful, the members of which are for six years, are likely to lessen your burthens or increase your taxes or whether in case your state government should be annihilated, which will probably be the case, or dwindle into a mere corporation, the continental government will be competent to attend to your local concerns? You can also best determine whether the power of levying and imposing internal taxes at pleasure will be of real use to you or not or whether a continental collector assisted by a few faithful soldiers will be more eligible than your present collectors of taxes? You will also, in your deliberations on this important business, judge whether the liberty of the press may be considered as a blessing or a curse in a free government, and whether a declaration for the preservation of it is necessary or whether in a plan of government any declaration of rights should be prefixed or inserted? You will be able likewise to determine, whether in a free government there ought or ought not to be any provision against a standing army in time of peace or whether the trial by jury in civil causes is become dangerous and ought to be abolished and whether the judiciary of the United States is not so constructed as to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several states? You will also be able to judge whether such inconveniences have been experienced by the present mode of trial between citizen and citizen of different states as to render a continental court necessary for that purpose or whether there can be any real use in the appellate jurisdiction with respect to fact as well as law? We shall not dwell longer on the subject; one thing however it is proper you should be informed of; the Convention were not unanimous with respect to men though they were as states. Several of those who have signed did not fully approve of the plan of government, and three of the members, viz., Governor Randolph and Colonel George Mason of Virginia, and Eldredge [sic] Gerry, Esquire of Massachusetts, whose characters are very respectable, had such strong objections as to refuse signing. The Confederation no doubt is defective and requires amendment and revision, and had the Convention extended their plan to the enabling the United States to regulate commerce, equalize the impost, collect it throughout the United States, and have the entire jurisdiction over maritime affairs, leaving the exercise of internal taxation to the separate states, we apprehend there would have been no objection to the plan of government. The matter will be before you, and you will be able to judge for yourselves. �Show that you seek not yourselves, but the good of your�country, and may He who alone has dominion over the passions and understandings of men enlighten and direct you aright, that posterity may bless God for the wisdom of their ancestors.�"
Newspaper,No,Fair Play,,Independent Gazetteer,Tar and Feathers,9/29/1787,"I am a federal man in the truest sense of the word. I wish to see the United States in possession of a general government which may insure to them strength and liberty at home and respectability abroad, but I do not agree with a writer in your paper of this day, that every person who objects to some parts, or even to the whole, of the aristocratical plan proposed by the late Convention ought to have �a coat of Tar and Feathers.� Tar and feathers, I believe, never made a convert to any system whatever, whether religious or political; and that must be a most noble form of government indeed which requires such infamous measures to support and establish it! That would be a mob government with a witness! At the glorious period of our independence, the newspapers were filled with publications against as well as for that salutary measure: and I am clearly of opinion, that the LIBERTY OF THE PRESS�the great bulwark of all the liberties of the people�ought never to be restrained (notwithstanding the Honorable Convention did not think fit to make the least declaration in its favor) and that on every occasion truth and justice should have FAIR PLAY."
Newspaper,No,Protest of the Minority,,Pennsylvania Gazette,,10/3/1787,"Dissentient: 1st. Because, by the diminution of the power of the state of Pennsylvania, we shall have fewer offices, and smaller salaries, to bestow upon our friends. 2d. Because, like the Declaration of Independence, the measure, if a right one, is premature. 3d. Because the new Federal Constitution puts an end to all future emissions of paper money, and to tender laws, to both of which many of us owe our fortunes, and all of us our prospects of extrication from debt and exemption from gaol, or the benefit of the bankrupt law. 4th. Because, by the new Constitution of the United States, we shall be compelled to pay our taxes, whereas we now pay nothing towards the support of government, and yet are handsomely supported out of the state treasury. 5th. Because the new Constitution was not submitted to the consideration of the Antifederal junto in Philadelphia before it was sent to Congress, to each individual whereof America is under greater obligations than to General Washington. 6th. Because, by the 6th section of the 1st Article of the Constitution of the United States, it is made impossible for persons in power to create offices for themselves, or to appoint themselves to offices. This we conceive to be an evident departure from the free and excellent constitution of Pennsylvania, by which it is lawful for assemblymen and councillors to appoint themselves or their sons to all, or to any of the offices of the state. 7th. Because a disaffected member of the Federal Convention from Virginia [George Mason], in a closet conversation with R[obert] Whitehill, disapproved of the federal government, and we hold it to be our duty rather to follow his advice, than the inclinations of our constituents.2 8th. Because, from the power claimed by the new Constitution, Congress will have a right to suppress all �domestic insurrections� in particular states, by which means we shall be deprived of the only means of opposing the laws of this state, especially laws for collecting taxes. F[indle]y, W[hitehi]ll, and Co.3 Major [Alexander] B[oy]d�s Cellar, September 29, 1787."
Letter,Yes,Thomas Duncan,William Irvine,,,10/3/1787,"We have this moment received intelligence of the resolution of the Assembly for calling a convention and of the very improper conduct of the representatives on this side the Susquehanna. The people in general seem well disposed to the Federal Constitution, and I believe it will be a difficult task for their former leaders to prevent them from exerting themselves to adopt it. [William] Brown is bellowing against it, but his audience is very small. [Ephraim] Blain appears its friend. [John] Jordon is lukewarm, but a great majority of the people cry out for its immediate adoption. The first impression made on their minds is in its favor, and first impressions are not easily removed. The Constitutionalists are splitting here about a councillor�[Robert] Whitehill against [Frederick] Watts. The people on the hills against those in the valley. The Republicans are not able to do more than hiss them on and foment their divisions at this election�and I think will fight under General Watts�s banner merely to disappoint Robert."
Newspaper,No,Fair Play,,Independent Gazetteer,Tar and Feathers,10/4/1787,"Your correspondent, who has assumed the signature of�Tar and Feathers, seems to allow that his mode of administering�justice�never made a convert; yet persists in his diabolical plan of endeavoring to inflame the minds of the people against those who happen to differ from him on political subjects. Perhaps, like the fox who lost his tail and strove to persuade the rest of his species to have theirs cut off also, he himself has undergone the�discipline�he is now so anxious to bestow on others. I wonder whether this gentleman (though I much doubt he has any claim to the epithet) ever had the honor of bearing either �the sword of war or of justice.� One would be apt to conclude he never had; otherwise he could not be so destitute of those excellent qualifications which constitute the character of a�good soldier and an impartial judge. Generous minds will ever rouse with indignation against such�monsters�as wish to interrupt the peace of society by flying in the face of all law and authority. And I must confess the�new Constitution�comes in a very �questionable shape,� when attended with such furious advocates as �Tar and Feathers.� Brave men and good citizens will never associate with the most abandoned of the human species, for such we must deem those creatures who contend for�mob�governments, to abuse an individual because he entertains a different opinion from themselves, or because he has firmness and honesty enough to avow his�own�sentiments. None but the mere�echoes�and tools of party and faction would engage in such dirty business. It is a fact, I believe, that will not be denied, that many of those who arrange themselves under the banners of those who call themselves�Federalists�were either�downright Tories, lukewarm Whigs, or disaffected to the cause of America and the Revolution; and who now eagerly wish to seize the present opportunity to gratify their revenge and to retaliate on the�real Whigs�of 1775 and 1776. And I am the more inclined to espouse this opinion, because the author of�Tar and Feathers�aims to destroy the distinction of�Whig�and�Tory, and to establish one more odious, viz.�Federalists�and�Antifederalists4 The�new�friends to the�tarring and feathering�system seem to direct their resentment against the�Tories. �Laughable indeed would it be to suppose,� that they had not well examined and sought for a few of that class of beings among their own party to begin with. Look at home first Mr.�Tar and Feathers, and try to work a reformation there before you begin to�deal damnation�abroad. There invoke the�Great Jehovah�to forgive thy past crimes and follies; and presume no more thou blasphemous wretch to compare your infamous doctrine of�expedients�with the purpose of that DEITY, �who sent the deluge in the days of Noah.� I shall conclude for the present, Mr. Oswald, with observing, that I consider this daemon of discord as some cowardly �villain,� �however dignified among villains��some ferocious monster, whose nerves do not admit of his heading a�tarring and feathering mob, but who, at the same time, would rejoice to see anarchy and confusion prevailing and triumphing over peace and good order among the citizens of Philadelphia."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/5/1787,"Friends, Countrymen and Fellow Citizens: Permit one of yourselves to put you in mind of certain�liberties�and�privileges�secured to you by the constitution of this commonwealth, and to beg your serious attention to his uninterested opinion upon the plan of federal government submitted to your consideration, before you surrender these great and valuable privileges up forever. Your present frame of government secures to you a right to hold yourselves, houses, papers and possessions free from search and seizure, and therefore warrants granted without oaths or affirmations first made, affording sufficient foundation for them, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search your houses or seize your persons or property, not particularly described in such warrant, shall not be granted. Your constitution further provides �that in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the parties have a right�to trial by jury, which ought to be held sacred.� It also provides and declares, �that the people have a right of�FREEDOM OF SPEECH,�and of�WRITING�and�PUBLISHING�their sentiments, therefore�THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS OUGHT NOT TO BE RESTRAINED.� The constitution of Pennsylvania is�yet�in existence,�as yet�you have the right to�freedom of speech, and of�publishing your sentiments. How long those rights will appertain to you, you yourselves are called upon to say, whether your�houses�shall continue to be your�castles;�whether your�papers, your�persons�and your�property�are to be held sacred and free from�general warrants, you are now to determine. Whether the�trial by jury�is to continue as your birthright, the freemen of Pennsylvania, nay, of all America, are now called upon to declare. Without presuming upon my own judgment, I cannot think it an unwarrantable presumption to offer my private opinion, and call upon others for theirs; and if I use my pen with the boldness of a freeman, it is because I know that�the liberty of the press yet remains unviolated, and�juries yet are judges. The late Convention have submitted to your consideration a plan of a new federal government. The subject is highly interesting to your future welfare. Whether it be calculated to promote the great ends of civil society, viz., the happiness and prosperity of the community; it behooves you well to consider, uninfluenced by the authority of names. Instead of that frenzy of enthusiasm, that has actuated the citizens of Philadelphia, in their approbation of the proposed plan, before it was possible that it could be the result of a rational investigation into its principles; it ought to be dispassionately and deliberately examined, and its own intrinsic merit the only criterion of your patronage. If ever free and unbiased discussion was proper or necessary, it is on such an occasion. All the blessings of liberty and the dearest privileges of freemen are now at stake and dependent on your present conduct. Those who are competent to the task of developing the principles of government ought to be encouraged to come forward, and thereby the better enable the people to make a proper judgment; for the science of government is so abstruse, that few are able to judge for themselves; without such assistance the people are too apt to yield an implicit assent to the opinions of those characters, whose abilities are held in the highest esteem, and to those in whose integrity and patriotism they can confide; not considering that the love of domination is generally in proportion to talents, abilities, and superior acquirements; and that the men of the greatest purity of intention may be made instruments of despotism in the hands of the�artful and designing. If it were not for the stability and attachment which time and habit gives to forms of government, it would be in the power of the enlightened and aspiring few, if they should combine, at any time to destroy the best establishments, and even make the people the instruments of their own subjugation. The late Revolution having effaced in a great measure all former habits, and the present institutions are so recent, that there exists not that great reluctance to innovation, so remarkable in old communities, and which accords with reason, for the most comprehensive mind cannot foresee the full operation of material changes on civil polity; it is the genius of the common law to resist innovation. The wealthy and ambitious, who in every community think they have a right to lord it over their fellow creatures, have availed themselves, very successfully, of this favorable disposition; for the people thus unsettled in their sentiments, have been prepared to accede to any extreme of government; all the distresses and difficulties they experience, proceeding from various causes, have been ascribed to the impotency of the present Confederation, and thence they have been led to expect full relief from the adoption of the proposed system of government; and in the other event, immediate ruin and annihilation as a nation. These characters flatter themselves that they have lulled all distrust and jealousy of their new plan, by gaining the concurrence of the two men in whom America has the highest confidence, and now triumphantly exult in the completion of their long meditated schemes of power and aggrandizement. I would be very far from insinuating that the two illustrious personages alluded to, have not the welfare of their country at heart; but that the unsuspecting goodness and zeal of the one, has been imposed on, in a subject of which he must be necessarily inexperienced, from his other arduous engagements; and that the weakness and indecision attendant on old age, has been practiced on in the other.2 I am fearful that the principles of government inculcated in Mr. [John] Adam�s treatise, and enforced in the numerous essays and paragraphs in the newspapers, have misled some well-designing members of the late Convention.3�But it will appear in the sequel, that the construction of the proposed plan of government is infinitely more extravagant. I have been anxiously expecting that some enlightened patriot would, ere this, have taken up the pen to expose the futility, and counteract the baneful tendency of such principles. Mr. Adams�s�sine qua non�of a good government is three balancing powers, whose repelling qualities are to produce an equilibrium of interests, and thereby promote the happiness of the whole community. He asserts that the administrators of every government will ever be actuated by views of private interest and ambition, to the prejudice of the public good; that therefore the only effectual method to secure the rights of the people and promote their welfare is to create an opposition of interests between the members of two distinct bodies, in the exercise of the powers of government, and balanced by those of a third. This hypothesis supposes human wisdom competent to the task of instituting three coequal orders in government, and a corresponding weight in the community to enable them respectively to exercise their several parts, and whose views and interests should be so distinct as to prevent a coalition of any two of them for the destruction of the third. Mr. Adams, although he has traced the constitution of every form of government that ever existed, as far as history affords materials, has not been able to adduce a single instance of such a government; he indeed says that the British constitution is such in theory, but this is rather a confirmation that his principles are chimerical and not to be reduced to practice. If such an organization of power were practicable, how long would it continue? Not a day, for there is so great a disparity in the talents, wisdom and industry of mankind, that the scale would presently preponderate to one or the other body, and with every accession of power the means of further increase would be greatly extended. The state of society in England is much more favorable to such a scheme of government than that of America. There they have a powerful hereditary nobility and real distinctions of rank and interests; but even there, for want of that perfect equality of power and distinction of interests, in the three orders of government, they exist but in name; the only operative and efficient check, upon the conduct of administration is the sense of the people at large. Suppose a government could be formed and supported on such principles. Would it answer the great purposes of civil society? If the administrators of every government are actuated by views of private interest and ambition, how is the welfare and happiness of the community to be the result of such jarring adverse interests? Therefore, as different orders in government will not produce the good of the whole, we must recur to other principles. I believe it will be found that the form of government which holds those entrusted with power, in the greatest responsibility to their constituents, the best calculated for freemen. A republican, or free government, can only exist where the body of the people are virtuous, and where property is pretty equally divided. In such a government the people are the sovereign and their sense or opinion is the criterion of every public measure; for when this ceases to be the case, the nature of the government is changed, and an aristocracy, monarchy, or despotism will rise on its ruin. The highest responsibility is to be attained, in a simple struction [sic] of government, for the great body of the people never steadily attend to the operations of government, and for want of due information are liable to be imposed on. If you complicate the plan by various orders, the people will be perplexed and divided in their sentiments about the source of abuses or misconduct. Some will impute it to the Senate, others to the House of Representatives, and so on, that the interposition of the people may be rendered imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if, imitating the constitution of Pennsylvania, you vest all the legislative power in one body of men (separating the executive and judicial) elected for a short period, and necessarily excluded by rotation from permanency, and guarded from precipitancy and surprise by delays imposed on its proceedings, you will create the most perfect responsibility; for then,�whenever the people feel a grievance they cannot mistake the authors, and will apply the remedy with certainty and effect, discarding them at the next election. This tie of responsibility will obviate all the dangers apprehended from a single legislature, and will the best secure the rights of the people. Having premised thus much, I shall now proceed to the examination of the proposed plan of government, and I trust, shall make it appear to the meanest capacity, that it has none of the essential requisites of a free government; that it is neither founded on those balancing restraining powers, recommended by Mr. Adams and attempted in the British constitution, or possessed of that responsibility to its constituents, which, in my opinion, is the only effectual security for the liberties and happiness of the people; but on the contrary, that it is a most daring attempt to establish a despotic aristocracy among freemen, that the world has ever witnessed. I shall previously consider the extent of the powers intended to be vested in Congress, before I examine the construction of the general government. It will not be controverted that the legislative is the highest delegated power in government, and that all others are subordinate to it. The celebrated Montesquieu establishes it as a maxim, that legislation necessarily follows the power of taxation. By section 8, of the first Article of the proposed plan of government, �the Congress are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and�general welfare�of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises, shall be uniform throughout the United States.� Now what can be more comprehensive than these words? Not content by other sections of this plan, to grant all the great executive powers of a confederation, and a STANDING ARMY IN TIME OF PEACE, that grand engine of oppression, and moreover the absolute control over the commerce of the United States and all external objects of revenue, such as unlimited imposts upon imports, etc.; they are to be vested with every species of�internal�taxation. Whatever taxes, duties and excises that they may deem requisite for the�general welfare�may be imposed on the citizens of these states, levied by the officers of Congress, distributed through every district in America; and the collection would be enforced by the standing army, however grievous or improper they may be. The Congress may construe every purpose for which the state legislatures now lay taxes, to be for the�general welfare, and thereby seize upon every object of revenue. The judicial power by 1st section of Article 3 �shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws�of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, to controversies to which the United States shall be a party, to controversies between two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state, between citizens of different states, between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.� The judicial power to be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such Inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The objects of jurisdiction recited above are so numerous, and the shades of distinction between civil causes are oftentimes so slight, that it is more than probable that the state judicatories would be wholly superseded; for in contests about jurisdiction, the federal court, as the most powerful, would ever prevail. Every person acquainted with the history of the courts in England knows by what ingenious sophisms they have, at different periods, extended the sphere of their jurisdiction over objects out of the line of their institution, and contrary to their very nature; courts of a criminal jurisdiction obtaining cognizance in civil causes. To put the omnipotency of Congress over the state government and judicatories out of all doubt, the 6th Article ordains that �this constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the�supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.� By these sections the all-prevailing power of taxation, and such extensive legislative and judicial powers are vested in the general government, as must in their operation, necessarily absorb the state legislatures and judicatories; and that such was in the contemplation of the framers of it, will appear from the provision made for such event, in another part of it; (but that, fearful of alarming the people by so great an innovation, they have suffered the forms of the separate governments to remain, as a blind). By section 4th of the 1st Article, �the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof;�but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.� The plain construction of which is, that when the state legislatures drop out of sight, from the necessary operation of this government, then Congress are to provide for the election and appointment of Representatives and Senators. If the foregoing be a just comment, if the United States are to be melted down into one empire, it becomes you to consider whether such a government, however constructed, would be eligible in so extended a territory; and whether it would be practicable, consistent with freedom? It is the opinion of the greatest writers, that a very extensive country cannot be governed on democratical principles, on any other plan, than a confederation of a number of small republics, possessing all the powers of internal government, but united in the management of their foreign and general concerns. It would not be difficult to prove, that anything short of despotism could not bind so great a country under one government; and that whatever plan you might, at the first setting out, establish, it would issue in a despotism. If one general government could be instituted and maintained on principles of freedom, it would not be so competent to attend to the various local concerns and wants, of every particular district; as well as the peculiar governments, who are nearer the scene and possessed of superior means of information. Besides, if the business of the�whole�Union is to be managed by one government, there would not be time. Do we not already see, that the inhabitants in a number of larger states, who are remote from the seat of government, are loudly complaining of the inconveniencies and disadvantages they are subjected to on this account, and that, to enjoy the comforts of local government, they are separating into smaller divisions. Having taken a review of the powers, I shall now examine the construction of the proposed general government. Article I, section I. �All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.� By another section, the President (the principal executive officer) has a conditional control over their proceedings. Section 2. �The house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year, by the people of the several states. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every 30,000 inhabitants.� The Senate, the other constituent branch of the legislature, is formed by the legislature of each state appointing two Senators, for the term of six years. The executive power by Article 2, section I is to be vested in a President of the United States of America, elected for four years. Section 2�gives him �power, by and with the consent of the senate to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law, &c.� And by another section he has the absolute power of granting reprieves and pardons for treason and all other high crimes and misdemeanors, except in case of impeachment. The foregoing are the outlines of the plan. Thus we see, the House of Representatives are on the part of the people to balance the Senate, who I suppose will be composed of the�better sort, the�wellborn, etc. The number of the Representatives (being only one for every 30,000 inhabitants) appears to be too few, either to communicate the requisite information of the wants, local circumstances and sentiments of so extensive an empire, or to prevent corruption and undue influence, in the exercise of such great powers; the term for which they are to be chosen, too long to preserve a due dependence and accountability to their constituents; and the mode and places of their election not sufficiently ascertained, for as Congress have the control over both, they may govern the choice, by ordering the�Representatives�of a�whole�state, to be�elected�in�one�place, and that too may be the most�inconvenient. The Senate, the great efficient body in this plan of government, is constituted on the most unequal principles. The smallest state in the Union has equal weight with the great states of Virginia, Massachusetts, or Pennsylvania. The Senate, besides its legislative functions, has a very considerable share in the executive; none of the principal appointments to office can be made without its advice and consent. The term and mode of its appointment will lead to permanency; the members are chosen for six years, the mode is under the control of Congress, and as there is no exclusion by rotation, they may be continued for life, which, from their extensive means of influence, would follow of course. The President, who would be a mere pageant of state, unless he coincides with the views of the Senate, would either become the head of the aristocratic junto in that body, or its minion; besides, their influence being the most predominant, could the best secure his reelection to office. And from his power of granting pardons, he might screen from punishment the most treasonable attempts on the liberties of the people, when instigated by the Senate. From this investigation into the organization of this government, it appears that it is devoid of all responsibility or accountability to the�great body of the people, and that so far from being a regular balanced government, it would be in practice a�permanent�ARISTOCRACY. The framers of it, actuated by the true spirit of such a government, which ever abominates and suppresses all free enquiry and discussion, have made no provision for the�liberty of the press, that grand�palladium of freedom�and�scourge of tyrants, but observed a total silence on that head. It is the opinion of some great writers, that if the liberty of the press, by an institution of religion, or otherwise, could be rendered�sacred, even in�Turkey, that despotism would fly before it. And it is worthy of remark, that there is no declaration of personal rights, premised in most free constitutions; and that trial by�jury�in�civil�cases is taken away; for what other construction can be put on the following, viz., Article III, section 2d. �In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have�original�jurisdiction. In all the other cases above mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have�appellate�jurisdiction, both as to�law and fact.� It would be a novelty in jurisprudence, as well as evidently improper to allow an appeal from the verdict of a jury, on the matter of fact; therefore, it implies and allows of a dismission of the jury in civil cases, and especially when it is considered, that jury trial in criminal cases is expressly stipulated for, but not in civil cases. But our situation is represented to be so�critically�dreadful, that however reprehensible and exceptionable the proposed plan of government may be, there is no alternative between the adoption of it and absolute ruin. My fellow citizens, things are not at that crisis; it is the argument of tyrants. The present distracted state of Europe secures us from injury on that quarter, and as to domestic dissensions, we have not so much to fear from them, as to precipitate us into this form of government, without it is a safe and a proper one. For remember, of all�possible�evils, that of�despotism�is the�worst�and the most to be�dreaded. Besides, it cannot be supposed, that the first essay on so difficult a subject, is so well digested, as it ought to be. If the proposed plan, after a mature deliberation, should meet the approbation of the respective states, the matter will end; but if it should be found to be fraught with dangers and inconveniencies, a future general convention, being in possession of the objections, will be the better enabled to plan a suitable government. Who�s here so base, that would a bondman be? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who�s here so vile, that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him have I offended."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/6/1787,"Another correspondent observes, that although the tide seems to run so high at present in favor of the new Constitution, there is no doubt but the people will soon change their minds when they have had time to examine it with coolness and impartiality.

Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,10/10/1787,"After all that has been spoken and written relative to the new code of government, (observes a N. York writer)2 it is generally allowed, that with a very few alterations, that have been already hastily suggested by anonymous writers on the subject, it will gratify the most sanguine wishes of the public. Perfection, it has been often said, is not the lot of human nature, why then must this Magna Charta of American liberty be supposed to come at once into the world, like Minerva out of the head of Jupiter,”3 in every respect finished and perfect?—Be the matter as it may, no friend to the liberties of this country and the rights of the people can object to a liberal and decent discussion of a form of [79]government which the public are yet to choose or reject, as their united wisdom shall hereafter determine, and not to saddle themselves with, merely because it may be agreeable to the men of great name and property amongst us.—I am convinced, also, that very few men of knowledge and reflection, unless interested, have already so fully made up their minds on the matter as to say that the plan proposed ought to be adopted as it stands, without any alteration or amendment. The subject is momentous, and involves the greatest consequences."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/12/1787,"Mr. printer, I am one of those who have long wished for a federal government, which should have power to protect our trade and provide for the general security of the United States. Accordingly, when the constitution proposed by the late convention made its appearance, I was disposed to embrace it almost without examination; I was determined not to be offended with trifles or to scan it too critically. �We want something: let us try this; experience is the best teacher: if it does not answer our purpose we can alter it: at all events it will serve for a beginning.� Such were my reasonings;�but, upon further reflection, I may say that I am shaken with very considerable doubts and scruples, I want a federal constitution; and yet I am afraid to concur in giving my consent to the establishment of that which is proposed. At the same time I really wish to have my doubts removed, if they are not well founded. I shall therefore take the liberty of laying some of them before the public, through the channel of your paper. In the first place, it appears to me that I was mistaken in supposing that we could so very easily make trial of this constitution and again change it at our pleasure. The conventions of the several states cannot propose any alterations�they are only to give their assent and ratification. And after the constitution is once ratified, it must remain fixed until two thirds of both the houses of Congress shall deem it necessary to propose amendments; or the legislatures of two thirds of the several states shall make application to Congress for the calling a convention for proposing amendments, which amendments shall not be valid till they are ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress.�This appears to me to be only a cunning way of saying that no alteration shall ever be made; so that whether it is a good constitution or a bad constitution, it will remain forever unamended. Lycurgus, when he promulgated his laws to the Spartans, made them swear that they would make no alterations in them until he should return from a journey which he was then about to undertake:�He chose never to return, and therefore no alterations could be made in his laws. The people were made to believe that they could make trial of his laws for a few months or years, during his absence, and as soon as he returned they could continue to observe them or reject at pleasure. Thus this celebrated Republic was in reality established by a trick. In like manner the proposed constitution holds out a prospect of being subject to be changed if it be found necessary or convenient to change it; but the conditions upon which an alteration can take place, are such as in all probability will never exist. The consequence will be that, when the constitution is once established, it never can be altered or amended without some violent convulsion or civil war. The conditions, I say, upon which any alterations can take place, appear to me to be such as never will exist�two thirds of both houses of Congress or the legislatures of two thirds of the states, must agree in desiring a convention to be called. This will probably never happen; but if it should happen, then the convention may agree to the amendments or not as they think right; and after all, three fourths of the states must ratify the amendments.�Before all this labyrinth can be traced to a conclusion, ages will revolve, and perhaps the great principles upon which our late glorious revolution was founded, will be totally forgotten. If the principles of liberty are not firmly fixed and established in the present constitution, in vain may we hope for retrieving them hereafter. People once possessed of power are always loth to part with it; and we shall never find two thirds of a Congress voting or proposing any thing which shall derogate from their own authority and importance, or agreeing to give back to the people any part of those privileges which they have once parted with�so far from it; that the greater occasion there may be for a reformation, the less likelihood will there be of accomplishing it. The greater the abuse of power, the more obstinately is it always persisted in. As to any expectation of two thirds of the legislatures concurring in such a request, it is if possible, still more remote. The legislatures of the states will be but forms and shadows, and it will [378]be the height of arrogance and presumption in them, to turn their thoughts to such high subjects. After this constitution is once established, it is too evident that we shall be obliged to fill up the offices of assemblymen and councillors, as we do those of constables, by appointing men to serve whether they will or not, and fining them if they refuse. The members thus appointed, as soon as they can hurry through a law or two for repairing highways or impounding cattle, will conclude the business of their sessions as suddenly as possible; that they may return to their own business.�Their heads will not be perplexed with the great affairs of state�We need not expect two thirds of them ever to interfere in so momentous a question as that of calling a Continental convention.�The different legislatures will have no communication with one another from the time of the new constitution being ratified, to the end of the world. Congress will be the great focus of power as well as the great and only medium of communication from one state to another. The great, and the wise, and the mighty will be in possession of places and offices; they will oppose all changes in favor of liberty; they will steadily pursue the acquisition of more and more power to themselves and their adherents. The cause of liberty, if it be now forgotten, will be forgotten forever.�Even the press which has so long been employed in the cause of liberty, and to which perhaps the greatest part of the liberty which exists in the world is owing at this moment; the press may possibly be restrained of its freedom, and our children may possibly not be suffered to enjoy this most invaluable blessing of a free communication of each others sentiments on political subjects�Such at least appear to be some men�s fears, and I cannot find in the proposed constitution any thing expressly calculated to obviate these fears; so that they may or may not be realized according to the principles and dispositions of the men who may happen to govern us hereafter. One thing however is calculated to alarm our fears on this head;�I mean the fashionable language which now prevails so much and is so frequent in the mouths of some who formerly held very different opinions;�that common people have no business to trouble themselves about government. If this principle is just the consequence is plain that the common people need no information on the subject of politics. Newspapers, pamphlets and essays are calculated only to mislead and inflame them by holding forth to them doctrines which they have no business or right to meddle with, which they ought to leave to their superiors. Should the freedom of the press be restrained on the subject of politics, there is no doubt it will soon after be restrained on all other subjects, religious as well as civil. And if the freedom of the press shall be restrained, it will be another reason to despair of any amendments being made in favor of liberty, after the proposed constitution shall be once established. Add to this, that under the proposed constitution, it will be in the power of the Congress to raise [379]and maintain a standing army for their support, and when they are supported by an army, it will depend on themselves to say whether any amendments shall be made in favor of liberty. If these reflections are just it becomes us to pause, and reflect previously before we establish a system of government which cannot be amended; which will entail happiness or misery on ourselves and our children. We ought I say to reflect carefully, we ought not by any means to be in haste; but rather to suffer a little temporary inconvenience, than by any precipitation to establish a constitution without knowing whether it is right or wrong, and which if wrong, no length of time will ever mend. Scarce any people ever deliberately gave up their liberties; but many instances occur in history of their losing them forever by a rash and sudden act, to avoid a pressing inconvenience or gratify some violent passion of revenge or fear. It was a celebrated observation of one of our Assemblies before the revolution, during their struggles with the proprietaries, that �those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.� For the present I shall conclude with recommending to my countrymen not to be in haste, to consider carefully what we are doing. It is our own concern; it is our own business; let us give ourselves a little time at least to read the proposed constitution and know what it contains; for I fear that many, even of those who talk most about it have not even read it, and many others, who are as much concerned as any of us, have had no opportunity to read it. And it is certainly a suspicious circumstance that some people who are presumed to know most about the new constitution seem bent upon forcing it on their countrymen without giving them time to know what they are doing. Hereafter I may trouble you further on some other parts of this important subject; but I fear this letter is already too long."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/12/1787,"It is remarkable, says a correspondent, that the state of Virginia first opposed the power of the British parliament to tax America—she first instructed her Delegates to make the motion for the declaration of [55]Independence in Congress, and to her immortal honor be it recorded—she first by the lips of Mr. Maddison (her young Washington for patriotism) proposed the measure of the federal Convention, which ’tis likely will terminate in the salvation and establishment of the Union and liberties of America."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/17/1787,"Mr. printer, Since writing my last, in which I stated some doubts respecting the new federal constitution and expressed a wish that those doubts might be removed, I have met with the printed speech of James Wilson, Esquire.�This speech I find was made for the express purpose of removing objections from the minds of those who doubted, like myself, and wished to be satisfied; and except one or two hard names that have escaped the speaker, it bears the marks of more candor than is to be found in most of the production[s], which have been ushered into the world in support of the same measure. This speech also deserves the more attention as coming from a man of abilities fresh from �the impressions of four months constant attention to the subject.� The subject however is one of those which it imports us all very carefully to examine. I have therefore paid very considerable attention to his arguments, at the same time that I have examined with some care the foundation upon which they are built. Still I remain unsatisfied; and the more unsatisfied, as I have been disappointed in my hope of conviction, from a quarter, from which so much was to be expected�You will give me leave therefore to state shortly in your paper, some of those difficulties which still remain with me. The first principle which the gentleman endeavours to establish in his speech is a very important one, if true; and lays a sure foundation to reason upon, in answer to the objection which is made to the new constitution, [400]from the want of a bill of rights. The principle is this: that �in delegating federal powers, the congressional authority is to be collected, not from tacit implication, but from the positive grant expressed in the instrument of union,� �that every thing which is not given is reserved.� If this be a just representation of the matter, the authority of the several states will be sufficient to protect our liberties from the encroachments of Congress, without any continental bill of rights; unless the powers which are expressly given to Congress are too large. Without examining particularly at present, whether the powers expressly given to Congress are too large or too small, I shall beg leave to consider, whether the author of this speech is sufficiently accurate in his statement of the proposition above referred to.�To strip it of unnecessary words, the position may be reduced to this short sentence, �that every thing which is not expressly given to Congress is reserved;� or in other words �that Congress cannot exercise any power or authority that is not in express words delegated to them.��This certainly is the case under the first articles of confederation which hitherto have been the rule and standard of the powers of Congress; for in the second of those articles �each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power, jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.� It was the misfortune of these articles of confederation that they did not by express words give to Congress power sufficient for the purposes of the union; for Congress could not go beyond those powers so expressly given. The position of the speech, therefore is strictly true if applied to the first articles of confederation; �that every thing which is not expressly given is reserved.� We are not however to suppose that the speaker meant insidiously to argue from an article in the old confederation in favor of the new constitution, unless the same thing was also in the new constitution. Let us then fairly examine whether in the proposed new constitution there be any thing from which the gentleman can be justified in his opinion, �that every thing which is not expressly given to Congress is reserved.� In the first place then it is most certain that we find no such clause or article in the new constitution. There is nothing in the new constitution which either in form or substance bears the least resemblance to the second article of the confederation. It might nevertheless be a fair argument to insist upon from the nature of delegated powers, that no more power is given in such cases than is expressly given. Whether or not this ground of argument would be such as we might safely rest our liberties upon; or whether it would be more prudent to stipulate expressly as is done in the present confederation for the reservation of all such powers as are not expressly given, it is hardly necessary to determine at present. It strikes me that by the proposed constitution, so far from the reservation of all powers that are not expressly given, the future [401]Congress will be fully authorised to assume all such powers as they in their wisdom or wickedness, according as the one or the other may happen to prevail, shall from time to time think proper to assume. Let us weigh this matter carefully; for it is certainly of the utmost importance, and, if I am right in my opinion, the new constitution vests Congress with such unlimited powers as ought never to be entrusted to any men or body of men. It is justly observed that the possession of sovereign power is a temptation too great for human nature to resist; and although we have read in history of one or two illustrious characters who have refused to enslave their country when it was in their power;�although we have seen one illustrious character in our own times resisting the possession of power when set in competition with his duty to his country, yet these instances are so very rare, that it would be worse than madness to trust to the chance of their being often repeated. To proceed then with the enquiry, whether the future Congress will be restricted to those powers which are expressly given to them. I would observe that in the opinion of Montesquieu, and of most other writers, ancient as well as modern, the legislature is the sovereign power. It is certainly the most important. If any one doubts this, let him reflect upon the frequent inroads which the legislature of Pennsylvania has made upon the other branches of government: Inroads which it is much to be feared, if the powers of government in Pennsylvania should ever in time to come be an object worth contending about, no council of censors will ever be able to check or restrain.2 Let us then see what are the powers expressly given to the legislature of Congress, and what checks are interposed in the way of the continental legislature�s assuming what further power they shall think proper to assume. To this end let us look to the first article of the proposed new constitution, which treats of the legislative powers of Congress; and to the eighth section which pretends to define those powers. We find here that the congress, in its legislative capacity, shall have the power �to lay and collect taxes, duties and excises; to borrow money; to regulate commerce; to fix the rule for naturalization and the laws of bankruptcy; to coin money; to punish counterfeiters; establish post offices and post roads; to secure copy rights to authors; to constitute tribunals; to define and punish piracies; to declare war; to raise and support armies; to provide and support a navy; to make rules for the army and navy; to call forth the militia; to organize, arm and discipline the militia; to exercise absolute power over a district of ten miles square, independant of all the state legislatures, and to be alike absolute over all forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards and other needful buildings thereunto belonging.� This is a short abstract of the powers expressly given to Congress. These powers are very extensive, but I shall not stay at present to inquire whether these express powers were necessary to be given to Congress? [402]whether they are too great or too small? My object is to consider that undefined, unbounded and immense power which is comprised in the following clause;��And, to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States; or in any department or offices thereof.� Under such a clause as this can any thing be said to be reserved and kept back from Congress? Can it be said that the Congress have no power but what is expressed? �To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper� is in other words to make all such laws which the Congress shall think necessary and proper�fox who shall judge for the legislature what is necessary and proper?�Who shall set themselves above the sovereign?�What inferior legislature shall set itself above the supreme legislature?�To me it appears that no other power on earth can dictate to them or controul them, unless by force; and force either internal or external is one of those calamities which every good man would wish his country at all times to be delivered from.�This generation in America have seen enough of war and its usual concomitants to prevent all of us from wishing to see any more of it;�all except those who make a trade of war. But to the question;�without force what can restrain the Congress from making such laws as they please? What limits are there to their authority?�I fear none at all; for surely it cannot justly be said that they have no power but what is expressly given to them, whereby the very terms of their creation they are vested with the powers of making laws in all cases necessary and proper; when from the nature of their power they must necessarily be the judges, what laws are necessary and proper. The British act of Parliament, declaring the power of Parliament to make laws to bind America in all cases whatsoever, was not more extensive;3 for it is as true as a maxim, that even the British Parliament neither could nor would pass any law in any case in which they did not either deem it necessary and proper to make such law or pretend to deem it so. And in such cases it is not of a farthing consequence whether they really are of opinion that the law is necessary and proper, or only pretend to think so; for who can overrule their pretensions?�No one, unless we had a bill of rights to which we might appeal, and under which we might contend against any assumption of undue power and appeal to the judicial branch of the government to protect us by their judgements. This reasoning I fear Mr. Printer is but too just; and yet, if any man should doubt the truth of it; let me ask him one other question, what is the meaning of the latter part of the clause which vests the Congress with the authority of making all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all other powers;�besides the foregoing powers vested, &c. &c. Was it thought that the foregoing powers might perhaps admit of some restraint in their construction as to what was necessary and proper to carry them into execution? Or was it [403]deemed right to add still further that they should not be restrained to the powers already named?�besides the powers already mentioned, other powers may be assumed hereafter as contained by implication in this constitution. The Congress shall judge of what is necessary and proper in all these cases and in all other cases;�in short in all cases whatsoever. Where then is the restraint? How are Congress bound down to the powers expressly given? what is reserved or can be reserved? Yet even this is not all�as if it were determined that no doubt should remain, by the sixth article of the constitution it is declared that, �this constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitutions or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.� The Congress are therefore vested with the supreme legislative power, without controul. In giving such immense, such unlimited powers, was there no necessity of a bill of rights to secure to the people their liberties? Is it not evident that we are left wholly dependent on the wisdom and virtue of the men who shall from time to time be the members of Congress? and who shall be able to say seven years hence, the members of Congress will be wise and good men, or of the contrary character. As I mean to pursue this subject in some other letters, I shall conclude for the present; and am, Yours, an old whig."
Newspaper,No,Montezuma,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/17/1787,"We the Aristocratic party of the United States, lamenting the many inconveniences to which the late confederation subjected the well-born, the better kind of people, bringing them down to the level of the rabble -- and holding in utter detestation that frontispiece to every bill of rights, that all men are born equal -- beg leave (for the purpose of drawing a line between such as we think were ordained to govern, and such as were made to bear the weight of government without having any share in its administration) to submit to our Friends in the first class for their inspection, the following defense of our monarchical, aristocratical democracy. 1st. As a majority of all societies consist of men who (though totally incapable of thinking or acting in governmental matters) are more readily led than driven, we have thought meet to indulge them in something like a democracy in the new constitution, which part we have designated by the popular name of the House of Representatives. But to guard against every possible danger from this lower house, we have subjected every bill they bring forward, to the double negative of our upper house and president. Nor have we allowed the populace the right to elect their representatives annually . . . lest this body should be too much under the influence and control of their constituents, and thereby prove the weatherboard of our grand edifice, to show the shiftings of every fashionable gale, -- for we have not yet to learn that little else is wanting to aristocratize the most democratical representative than to make him somewhat independent of his political creators. We have taken away that rotation of appointment which has so long perplexed us -- that grand engine of popular influence. Every man is eligible into our government from time to time for life. This will have a two -- fold good effect. First, it prevents the representatives from mixing with the lower class, and imbibing their foolish sentiments, with which they would have come charged on re-election. 2d. They will from the perpetuality of office be under our eye, and in a short time will think and act like us, independently of popular whims and prejudices. For the assertion that evil communications corrupt good manners, is not more true than its reverse. We have allowed this house the power to impeach, but we have tenaciously reserved the right to try. We hope gentlemen, you will see the policy of this clause -- for what matters it who accuses, if the accused is tried by his friends. In fine, this plebeian house will have little power, and that little be rightly shaped by our house of gentlemen, who will have a very extensive influence -- from their being chosen out of the genteeler class ... It is true, every third senatorial seat is to be vacated duennually, but two-thirds of this influential body will remain in office, and be ready to direct or (if necessary) bring over to the good old way, the young members, if the old ones should not be returned. And whereas many of our brethren, from a laudable desire to support their rank in life above the commonalty, have not only deranged their finances, but subjected their persons to indecent treatment (as being arrested for debt, etc.) we have framed a privilege clause, by which they may laugh at the fools who trusted them. But we have given out, that this clause was provided, only that the members might be able without interruption, to deliberate on the important business of their country. We have frequently endeavored to effect in our respective states, the happy discrimination which pervades this system; but finding we could not bring the states into it individually, we have determined ... and have taken pains to leave the legislature of each free and independent state, as they now call themselves, in such a situation that they will eventually be absorbed by our grand continental vortex, or dwindle into petty corporations, and have power over little else than yoking hogs or determining the width of cart wheels. But (aware that an intention to annihilate state legislatures, would be objected to our favorite scheme) we have made their existence (as a board of electors) necessary to ours. This furnishes us and our advocates with a fine answer to any clamors that may be raised on this subject. We have so interwoven continental and state legislatures that they cannot exist separately; whereas we in truth only leave them the power of electing us, for what can a provincial legislature do when we possess the exclusive regulation of external and internal commerce, excise, duties, imposts, post-offices and roads; when we and we alone, have the power to wage war, make peace, coin money (if we can get bullion) if not, borrow money, organize the militia and call them forth to execute our decrees, and crush insurrections assisted by a noble body of veterans subject to our nod, which we have the power of raising and keeping even in the time of peace. What have we to fear from state legislatures or even from states, when we are armed with such powers, with a president at our head? (A name we thought proper to adopt in conformity to the prejudices of a silly people who are so foolishly fond of a Republican government, that we were obliged to accommodate in names and forms to them, in order more effectually to secure the substance of our proposed plan; but we all know that Cromwell was a King, with the title of Protector). I repeat it, what have we to fear armed with such powers, with a president at our head who is captain -- general of the army, navy and militia of the United States, who can make and unmake treaties, appoint and commission ambassadors and other ministers, who can grant or refuse reprieves or pardons, who can make judges of the supreme and other continental courts -- in short, who will be the source, the fountain of honor, profit and power, whose influence like the rays of the sun, will diffuse itself far and wide, will exhale all democratical vapors and break the clouds of popular insurrection? But again gentlemen, our judicial power is a strong work, a masked battery, few people see the guns we can and will ere long play off from it. For the judicial power embraces every question which can arise in law or equity, under this constitution and under the laws of the United States (which laws will be, you know, the supreme laws of the land). This power extends to all cases, affecting ambassadors or other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between citizens of the same State, claiming lands under grants of different States; and between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens or subjects. Now, can a question arise in the colonial courts, which the ingenuity or sophistry of an able lawyer may not bring within one or other of the above cases? Certainly not. Then our court will have original or appellate jurisdiction in all cases -- and if so, how fallen are state judicatures -- and must not every provincial law yield to our supreme flat? Our constitution answers yes. . . . And finally we shall entrench ourselves so as to laugh at the cabals of the commonalty. A few regiments will do at first; it must be spread abroad that they are absolutely necessary to defend the frontiers. Now a regiment and then a legion must be added quietly; by and by a frigate or two must be built, still taking care to intimate that they are essential to the support of our revenue laws and to prevent smuggling. We have said nothing about a bill of rights, for we viewed it as an eternal clog upon our designs, as a lock chain to the wheels of government -- though, by the way, as we have not insisted on rotation in our offices, the simile of a wheel is ill. We have for some time considered the freedom of the press as a great evil -- it spreads information, and begets a licentiousness in the people which needs the rein more than the spur; besides, a daring printer may expose the plans of government and lessen the consequence of our president and senate -- for these and many other reasons we have said nothing with respect to the right of the people to speak and publish their sentiments or about their palladiums of liberty and such stuff. We do not much like that sturdy privilege of the people -- the right to demand the writ of habeas corpus. We have therefore reserved the power of refusing it in cases of rebellion, and you know we are the judges of what is rebellion.... Our friends we find have been assiduous in representing our federal calamities, until at length the people at large -- frightened by the gloomy picture on one side, and allured by the prophecies of some of our fanciful and visionary adherents on the other -- are ready to accept and confirm our proposed government without the delay or forms of examination -- which was the more to be wished, as they are wholly unfit to investigate the principles or pronounce on the merit of so exquisite a system. Impressed with a conviction that this constitution is calculated to restrain the influence and power of the LOWER CLASS -- to draw that discrimination we have so long sought after; to secure to our friends privileges and offices, which were not to be ... [obtained] under the former government, because they were in common; to take the burden of legislation and attendance on public business off the commonalty, who will be much better able thereby to prosecute with effect their private business; to destroy that political thirteen headed monster, the state sovereignties; to check the licentiousness of the people by making it dangerous to speak or publish daring or tumultuary sentiments; to enforce obedience to laws by a strong executive, aided by military pensioners; and finally to promote the public and private interests of the better kind of people -- we submit it to your judgment to take such measures for its adoption as you in your wisdom may think fit. Signed by unanimous order of the lords spiritual and temporal. MONTEZUMA"
Newspaper,No,A Democratic Federalist,,Pennsylvania Herald,,10/17/1787,"The arguments of the Honorable Mr. [James] Wilson, expressed in the speech he made at the State House on the Saturday preceding the general election (as stated in the Pennsylvania Herald), although extremely ingenious and the best that could be adduced in support of so bad a cause, are yet extremely futile and will not stand the test of investigation. In the first place, Mr. Wilson pretends to point out a leading discrimination between the state constitutions and the Constitution of the United States. In the former, he says, every power which is not reserved is given, and in the latter, every power which is not given is reserved. And this may furnish an answer, he adds, to those who object that a bill of rights has not been introduced in the proposed Federal Constitution. If this doctrine is true, and since it is the only security that we are to have for our natural rights, it ought at least to have been clearly expressed in the plan of government. The 2d section of the present Articles of Confederation says: �Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and EVERY POWER, JURISDICTION AND RIGHT WHICH IS NOT BY THIS CONFEDERATION EXPRESSLY, DELEGATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.� This declaration (for what purpose I know not) is entirely omitted in the proposed Constitution. And yet there is a material difference between this Constitution and the present Confederation, for Congress in the latter are merely an executive body; it has no power to raise money, it has no judicial jurisdiction. In the other, on the contrary, the federal rulers are vested with each of the three essential powers of government�their laws are to be paramount to the laws of the different states. What then will there be to oppose to their encroachments? Should they ever pretend to tyrannize over the people, their standing army will silence every popular effort; it will be theirs to explain the powers which have been granted to them. Mr. Wilson�s distinction will be forgot, denied or explained away, and the liberty of the people will be no more. It is said in the 2d section of the 3d Article of the federal plan: �The judicial power shall extend to ALL CASES, in law and equity, arising under this constitution.� It is very clear that under this clause, the tribunal of the United States may claim a right to the cognizance of all offenses against the general government, and libels will not probably be excluded. Nay, those offenses may be by them construed, or by law declared misprision of treason, an offense which comes literally under their express jurisdiction. Where is then the safety of our boasted liberty of the press? And in case of a conflict of jurisdiction between the courts of the United States and those of the several commonwealths is it not easy to foresee which of the two will obtain the advantage? Under the enormous power of the new confederation, which extends to the individuals as well as to the states of America, a thousand means may be devised to destroy effectually the liberty of the press. There is no knowing what corrupt and wicked judges may do in process of time when they are not restrained by express laws. The case of John Peter Zenger of New York ought still to be present to our minds to convince us how displeasing the liberty of the press is to men in high power.2 At any rate, I lay it down as a general rule that wherever the powers of a government extend to the lives, the persons, and properties of the subject, all their rights ought to be clearly and expressly defined, otherwise they have but a poor security for their liberties. The second and most important objection to the federal plan, which Mr. Wilson pretends to be made in a disingenuous form, is the entire abolition of the trial by jury in civil cases. It seems to me that Mr. Wilson�s pretended answer is much more disingenuous than the objection itself, which I maintain to be strictly founded in fact. He says �that the cases open to trial by jury differing in the different states, it was therefore impracticable to have made a general rule.� This answer is extremely futile, because a reference might easily have been made to the common law of England, which obtains through every state, and cases in the maritime and civil law courts would of course have been excepted. I must also directly contradict Mr. Wilson when he asserts that there is no trial by jury in the courts of chancery. It cannot be unknown to a man of his high professional learning that whenever a difference arises about a matter of fact in the courts of equity in America or England, the fact is sent down to the courts of common law to be tried by a jury, and it is what the lawyers call a feigned issue. This method will be impracticable under the proposed form of judicial jurisdiction for the United States. But setting aside the equivocal answers of Mr. Wilson, I have it in my power to prove that under the proposed Federal Constitution the trial of facts in civil cases by a jury of the vicinage is entirely and effectually abolished and will be absolutely impracticable. I wish the learned gentleman had explained to us what is meant by the appellate jurisdiction as to law and fact which is vested in the superior court of the United States? As he has not thought proper to do it, I shall endeavor to explain it to my fellow citizens, regretting at the same time that it has not been done by a man whose abilities are so much superior to mine. The word appeal, if I understand it right in its proper legal signification includes the fact as well as the law, and precludes every idea of a trial by jury. It is a word of foreign growth and is only known in England and America in those courts which are governed by the civil or ecclesiastical law of the Romans. Those courts have always been considered in England as a grievance and have all been established by the usurpations of the ecclesiastical over the civil power. It is well-known that the courts of chancery in England were formerly entirely in the hands of ecclesiastics, who took advantage of the strict forms of the common law to introduce a foreign mode of jurisprudence under the specious name of Equity. Pennsylvania, the freest of the American states has wisely rejected this establishment and knows not even the name of a court of chancery. And in fact, there cannot be anything more absurd than a distinction between LAW and EQUITY. It might perhaps have suited those barbarous times when the law of England, like almost every other science, was perplexed with quibbles and Aristotelian distinctions, but it would be shameful to keep it up in these more enlightened days. At any rate, it seems to me that there is much more equity in a trial by jury, than in an appellate jurisdiction from the fact. An appeal, therefore, is a thing unknown to the common law. Instead of an appeal from facts, it admits of a second, or even third trial by different juries, and mistakes in points of law are rectified by superior courts in the form of a writ of error�and to a mere common lawyer, unskilled in the forms of the civil law courts, the words appeal from law and fact are mere nonsense and unintelligible absurdity. But even supposing that the superior court of the United States had the authority to try facts by juries of the vicinage, it would be impossible for them to carry it into execution. It is well-known that the supreme courts of the different states, at stated times in every year, go round the different counties of their respective states to try issues of fact, which is called riding the circuits. Now, how is it possible that the supreme continental court, which we will suppose to consist at most of five or six judges, can travel at least twice in every year, through the different counties of America, from New Hampshire to Kentucky, and from Kentucky to Georgia, to try facts by juries of the vicinage. Common sense will not admit of such a supposition. I am therefore right in my assertion, that trial by jury in civil cases is, by the proposed Constitution, entirely done away and effectually abolished. Let us now attend to the consequences of this enormous innovation and daring encroachment on the liberties of the citizens. Setting aside the oppression, injustice, and partiality that may take place in the trial of questions of property between man and man, we will attend to one single case, which is well worth our consideration. Let us remember that all cases arising under the new Constitution, and all matters between citizens of different states, are to be submitted to the new jurisdiction. Suppose, therefore, that the military officers of Congress, by a wanton abuse of power, imprison the free citizens of America, suppose the excise or revenue officers (as we find in Clayton�s Reports, page 44 Ward�s case that a constable, having a warrant to search for stolen goods, pulled down the clothes of a bed in which there was a woman and searched under her shift),3 suppose, I say, that they commit similar or greater indignities; in such cases a trial by jury would be our safest resource. Heavy damages would at once punish the offender and deter others from committing the same. But what satisfaction can we expect from a lordly court of justice, always ready to protect the officers of government against the weak and helpless citizen, and who will perhaps sit at the distance of many hundred miles from the place where the outrage was committed? What refuge shall we then have to shelter us from the iron hand of arbitrary power? O! my fellow citizens, think of this while it is yet time and never consent to part with the glorious privilege of trial by jury, but with your lives. But Mr. Wilson has not stopped here. He has told us that a STANDING ARMY, that great support of tyrants, not only was not dangerous, but that it was absolutely necessary. O! my much respected fellow citizens! and are you then reduced to such a degree of insensibility, that assertions like these will not rouse your warmest resentment and indignation? Are we then, after the experience of past ages, and the result of the inquiries of the best and most celebrated patriots have taught us to dread a standing army above all earthly evils, are we then to go over all the threadbare commonplace arguments that have been used without success by the advocates of tyranny, and which have been for a long time past so gloriously refuted! Read the excellent Burgh in his political disquisitions4 on this hackneyed subject, and then say, whether you think that a standing army is necessary in a free country? Even Mr. Hume, an aristocratical writer, has candidly confessed that an army is a mortal distemper in a government, of which it must at last inevitably perish (2d Burgh, 349); and the Earl of Oxford (Oxford, the friend of France and the pretender, the attainted Oxford) said in the British Parliament, in a speech on the mutiny bill, that �while he had breath, he would speak for the liberties of his country, and against courts martial and a standing army in peace as dangerous to the constitution� (ibid., page 455 [356]). Such were the speeches even of the enemies to liberty, when Britain had yet a right to be called free. But, says Mr. Wilson, �It is necessary to maintain the appearance of strength even in times of the most profound tranquility.� And what is this more than a threadbare hackneyed argument, which has been answered over and over in different ages and does not deserve even the smallest consideration? Had we a standing army when the British invaded our peaceful shores? Was it a standing army that gained the battle of Lexington and Bunker�s Hill, and took the ill-fated [John] Burgoyne? Is not a well-regulated militia sufficient for every purpose of internal defense? And which of you, my fellow citizens, is afraid of any invasion from foreign powers, that our brave militia would not be able immediately to repel? Mr. Wilson says that he does not know of any nation in the world which has not found it necessary to maintain the appearance of strength in a season of the most profound tranquility. If by this equivocal assertion, he has meant to say that there is no nation in the world without a standing army in time of peace, he has been mistaken. I need only adduce the example of Switzerland, which, like us, is a republic whose thirteen cantons, like our thirteen states, are under a federal government, and which besides is surrounded by the most powerful nations in Europe, all jealous of its liberty and prosperity. And yet that nation has preserved its freedom for many ages, with the sole help of a militia, and has never been known to have a standing army except when in actual war. Why should we not follow so glorious an example, and are we less able to defend our liberty without an army than that brave but small nation, which with its militia alone has hitherto defied all Europe? It is said likewise, that a standing army is not a new thing in America. Congress even at this moment have a standing army on foot. I answer, that precedent is not principle. Congress have no right to keep up a standing army in time of peace. If they do, it is an infringement of the liberties of the people�wrong can never be justified by wrong�but it is well-known that the assertion is groundless. The few troops that are on the banks of the Ohio were sent for the express purpose of repelling the invasion of the savages and protecting the inhabitants of the frontiers. It is our misfortune that we are never at peace with those inhuman butchers of their species, and while they remain in our neighborhood, we are always, with respect to them, in a state of war. As soon as the danger is over, there is no doubt but Congress will disband their handful of soldiers. It is therefore not true that Congress keep up a standing army in a time of peace and profound security. The objection to the enormous powers of the President and Senate is not the least important of all, but it requires a full discussion and ample investigation. I shall take another opportunity of laying before the public my observations upon this subject, as well as upon every other part of the new Constitution. At present I shall only observe that it is an established principle in America, which pervades every one of our state constitutions, that the legislative and executive powers ought to be kept forever separate and distinct from each other, and yet in this new Constitution we find there are TWO EXECUTIVE BRANCHES, each of which has more or less control over the proceedings of the legislature. This is an innovation of the most dangerous kind upon every known principle of government, and it will be easy for me to convince my fellow citizens that it will, in the first place, create a Venetian aristocracy and, in the end, produce an absolute monarchy. Thus I have endeavored to answer to the best of my abilities, the principal arguments of Mr. Wilson. I have written this in haste, in a short interval of leisure from my usual avocations. I have only traced the outlines of the subject, and I hope some abler hand will second my honest endeavors."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/20/1787,"�Great men are not always wise,� they have their seasons of inattention, and their moments of frailty and error, in which it is too evident, they are not wholly exempted from the infirmity of human nature. We ought not therefore implicitly to approve and admire, without examination, every act that proceeds even from the best and wisest of mankind. The proposed new plan of federal government, is undoubtedly the work of some of the ablest and best men in this country; but yet we are not, for that reason only, to believe that it is free from imperfection. The convention themselves inform us that the constitution which they offer to us, is the effect of mutual accommodations and concessions, in which mode it is certain that the best and wisest propositions are not always those which are adopted. Indeed it appears to me that, after all the time which has been spent in this business, the convention at the close of their session have been glad to lay hold of any system in which a majority could possibly concur, so as not to separate without doing any thing; and that the model of government now before us, is at least the work of haste and inattention. To be convinced of this, let us turn again to the sixth article, which I have referred to in the close of my last letter. By this article, not only the �proposed constitution and laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof;� but also �all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges [426]in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitutions or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.��The power of making treaties is vested in the president, with the concurrence of two thirds of the senators present; so that the president and two thirds of the senate have power to make laws in the form of treaties, independent of the legislature itself. If Great Britain, for instance, were willing to enter into a treaty with us, upon terms which would be inconsistent with the liberties of the people and destructive of the very being of a Republic, the consent of our president for the time being, and of two thirds of the senators present, even though the senators present should be but a very small part of the senate, will give such a treaty the validity of a law. What power will there be anywhere to prevent this?�None.�Where all power legislative and executive is vested in one man or one body of men, treaties are made by the same authority which makes the laws; but where the legislature is extinct [sic] from the executive, the approbation of the legislature ought to be had, before a treaty should have the force of a law; and even in England the parliament is constantly applied to for their sanction to every treaty which tends to introduce an innovation or the slightest alteration in the laws in being, the law there is not altered by the treaty itself; but by an act of parliament which confirms the treaty, and alters the law so as to accommodate it to the treaty. The King in council has no such power. The only answer which can be made to this objection, which is so obvious, to the power given by the proposed constitution to the executive of making treaties, which shall be the �supreme law of the land,� is, that it is not to be supposed they will abuse such power.�But yet we find that men in all ages have abused power, and that it has been the study of patriots and virtuous legislators at all times to restrain power, so as to prevent the abuse of it.�What then ought to be done, it may be asked.�Are treaties to be sent to all the different state legislatures for their approbation? By no means. But no treaty ought to be suffered to alter the law of the land, without the consent of the continental legislatures; the powers of the continental legislatures ought to be exactly defined; and there ought to be a bill of rights firmly established, which neither treaties nor acts of the legislature can alter. Let us however give fair play to the answer which has been attempted to be given to this Objection. The author of the speech tells us, that a bill of rights would have been superfluous and absurd; because �no powers are given to Congress but what are expressly given;� and �that we shall still enjoy those privileges of which we are not divested either by the intention or the act that brought that body into existence.�For2 instance, the liberty of the press.�What controul can proceed from the federal government to shackle or destroy that sacred palladium of national freedom?�-What controul!�Suppose that an act of the continental legislature should be passed to restrain the liberty of [427]the press;�to appoint licensers of the press in every town in America;�to limit the number of printers;�and to compel them to give security for their good behaviour, from year to year, as the licenses are renewed: If such a law should be once passed, what is there to prevent the execution of it?�By the sixth article of the proposed constitution, this act of the continental legislature is �the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.��Suppose a printer should be found hardy enough to contravene such a law when made, and to contest the validity of it.�He is prosecuted we will suppose, in this state-he pleads in his defence, that by the constitution of Pennsylvania, it is declared �that the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.��What will this avail him? The judge will be obliged to declare that �nothwithstanding the constitution of any state,� this act of the continental legislature which restrains the freedom of the press, is �the supreme law; and we must punish you�The bill of rights of Pennsylvania is nothing here. That bill of rights indeed is binding upon the legislature of Pennsylvania, but it is not binding upon the legislature of the continent.� Such must be the language and conduct of courts, as soon as the proposed continental constitution shall be adopted. As to the trial by jury, the question may be decided in a few words. Any future Congress sitting under the authority of the proposed new constitution, may, if they chuse, enact that there shall be no more trial by jury, in any of the United States; except in the trial of crimes; and this �supreme law� will at once annul the trial by jury, in all other cases. The author of the speech supposes that no danger �can possibly ensue, since the proceedings of the supreme court are to be regulated by the Congress, which is a faithful representation of the people; and the oppression of government is effectually barred; by declaring that in all criminal cases the trial by jury shall be preserved.� Let us examine the last clause of this sentence first.�I know that an affected indifference to the trial by jury has been expressed, by some persons high in the confidence of the present ruling party in some of the states;�and yet for my own part I cannot change the opinion I had early formed of the excellence of this mode of trial even in civil causes. On the other hand I have no doubt that whenever a settled plan shall be formed for the extirpation of liberty, the banishment of jury trials will be one of the means adopted for the purpose.�But how is it that �the oppression of government is effectually barred by declaring that in all criminal cases the trial by jury shall be preserved?��Are there not a thousand civil cases in which the government is a party?�In all actions for penalties, forfeitures and public debts, as well as many others, the government is a party and the whole weight of government is thrown into the scale of the prosecution yet these are all of them civil causes.�These penalties. [428]forfeitures and demands of public debts may be multiplied at the will and pleasure of government.�These modes of harrassing the subject have perhaps been more effectual than direct criminal prosecutions.�In the reign of Henry the Seventh of England, Empson and Dudley acquired an infamous immortality by these prosecutions for penalties and forfeitures:�Yet all these prosecutions were in the form of civil actions; they are undoubtedly objects highly alluring to a government.�They fill the public coffers and enable government to reward its minions at a cheap rate.�They are a profitable kind of revenge and gratify the officers about a court, who study their own interests more than corporal punishment.�Perhaps they have at all times been more eagerly pursued than mere criminal prosecutions.�Shall trial by jury be taken away in all these cases and shall we still be told that �we are effectually secured against the oppressions of government?� At this rate Judges may sit in the United States, as they did in some instances before the war, without a jury to condemn people�s property and extract money from their pockets, to be put into the pockets of the judges themselves who condemn them; and we shall be told that we are safe from the oppression of government.�No, Mr. Printer, we ought not to part with the trial by jury; we ought to guard this and many other privileges by a bill of rights, which cannot be invaded. The reason that is pretended in the speech why such a declaration; as a bill of rights requires, cannot be made for the protection of the trial by jury;��that we cannot with any propriety say �that the trial by jury shall be as heretofore�� in the case of a federal system of jurisprudence, is almost too contemptible to merit notice.�Is this the only form of words that language could afford on such an important occasion? Or if it were to what did these words refer when adopted in the constitutions of the states?�Plainly sir, to the trial by juries as established by the common law of England in the state of its purity;�That common law for which we contended so eagerly at the time of the revolution, and which now after the interval of a very few years, by the proposed new constitution we seem ready to abandon forever; at least in that article which is the most invaluable part of it; the trial by jury. Still however the great answer to all the objections that are made or can be made to the proposed constitution is this;�that there is no danger in trusting the Congress with any power: They will not abuse it. I shall conclude this letter with asking such as are willing to satisfy themselves with this answer only to look back for ten or twelve years and recollect what a mighty change has taken place in the political opinions of many people since that time. If they have forgotten let me beg of them to read over the publications of the years, 1774, 1775, 1776 and 1777. What was the spirit, what was the complaints of those times from Congress down to the smallest meeting of the people? Our present language will be found to give the lie to our former professions; [429]and we have sinned egregiously in wading thro� such an ocean of blood, if we were not well founded in the pretensions upon which we encountered the horrors of a civil war in establishing the revolution.�If such has been the change, as a very short examination will convince any man that has taken place in a few years past, what right have we to trust to the existence of such pure and immaculate virtue in time to come, that we should tamely and implicitly surrender our liberties at discretion into the hands of a government whose constituent members are totally unknown to us. Solomon has told us that no man knows whether a fool or a wise man is to inherit his estate; neither do we know whether honest and virtuous men or knaves and tyrants are to regulate our future councils. Let us then guard ourselves, as far as we can, against the possibility of being enslaved by wicked men, whilst the power of guarding ourselves is in our own hands. I know that the country is distressed; but it is not distressed beyond the power of remedy.�Let us take care that we do not involve ourselves in slavery, from the distresses of which we can never redeem ourselves."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Freeman's Journal,,10/24/1787,"To the people of Pennsylvania John 3d, verse 20th��For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.� But �there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid that shall not be known. Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light: and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed on the housetops.� St. Luke, chap, xii, 2d and 3d verses. Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Citizens! The formation of a good government, is the greatest effort of human wisdom, actuated by disinterested patriotism; but such is the cursed nature of ambition, so prevalent among men,1 that it would sacrifice every thing to its selfish gratification; hence the fairest opportunities of advancing the happiness of humanity, are so far from being properly improved, that they are too often converted to2 the votaries of power and domination, into the means of obtaining their nefarious ends. It will be the misfortune of America of adding to the number of examples of this kind, if the proposed plan of government should be adopted; but I trust, short as the time allowed you for consideration is, you will be so fully convinced of the truth of this, as to escape the impending danger: it is only necessary to strip the monster of its assumed garb, and to exhibit it in its native [56]colours, to excite the universal abhorrence and rejection of every virtuous and patriotic mind. For the sake of my dear country, for the honor of human nature, I hope and am persuaded, that the good sense of the people will enable them to rise superior to the most formidable conspiracy against the liberties of a free and enlightened nation, that the world has ever witnessed. How glorious would be the triumph! How it would immortalize the present generation in the annals of freedom! The establishment of a government, is a subject of such momentous and lasting concern, that it should not be gone into without the clearest conviction of its propriety; which can only be the result of the fullest discussion, the most thorough investigation and dispassionate consideration of its nature, principles and construction. You are now called upon to make this decision, which involves in it, not only your fate, but that of your posterity for ages to come. Your determination will either ensure the possession of those blessings, which render life desirable, or entail those evils which make existence a curse:�that such are the consequences of a wise or improper organization of government, the history of mankind abundantly testifies. If you viewed the magnitude of the object in its true light, you would join with me in sentiment, that the new government ought not to be implicitly admitted. Consider then duly before you leap, for after the rubicon is once passed, there will be no retract.3 If you were even well assured that the utmost purity of intention predominated in the production of the proposed government, such is the imperfection of human reason and knowledge, that it would not be wise in you to adopt it with precipitation in toto, for all former experience must teach you the propriety of a revision on such occasions, to correct the errors, and supply the deficiencies, that may appear necessary. In every government whose object is the public welfare, the laws are subjected to repeated revisions, in some by different orders in governments, in others by an appeal to the judgment of the people and deliberative forms of procedure. A knowledge of this, as well as of other states, will show that in every instance where a law has been passed without the usual precautions, it has been productive of great inconvenience and evils, and frequently has not answered the end in view, a supplement becoming necessary to supply its deficiencies. What then are we to think of the motives and designs of those men who are urging the implicit and immediate adoption of the proposed government; are they fearful, that if you exercise your good sense and discernment, you will discover the masqued aristocracy, that they are attempting to smuggle upon you, under the suspicious garb of republicanism?�When [57]we find that the principal agents in this business, are the very men who fabricated the form of government, it certainly ought to be conclusive evidence of their invidious design to deprive us of our liberties�The circumstances attending this matter, are such as should in a peculiar manner excite your suspicion; it might not be useless to take a review of some of them. In many of the states, particularly in this and the northern states, there are aristocratic junto�s of the well-born few, who had been zealously endeavouring since the establishment of their constitutions, to humble that offensive upstart, equal liberty; but all their efforts were unavailing, the ill-bred churl obstinately kept his assumed station. However, that which could not be accomplished in the several states, is now attempting through the medium of the future Congress.�Experience having shewn great defects in the present confederation, particularly in the regulation of commerce and marritime affairs; it became the universal wish of America to grant further powers, so as to make the federal government adequate to the ends of its institution. The anxiety on this head was greatly encreased, from the impoverishment and distress occasioned by the excessive importations of foreign merchandise and luxuries and consequent drain of specie, since the peace: thus the people were in the disposition of a drowning man, eager to catch at any thing that promised relief, however delusory. Such an opportunity for the acquisition of undue power, has never been viewed with indifference by the ambitious and designing in any age or nation, and it has accordingly been too successfully improved by such men among us. The deputies from this state (with the exception of two)4 and most of those from the other states in the union, were unfortunately of this complexion, and many of them of such superior endowments, that in an exparte discussion of the subject by specious glosses, they have gained the concurrence of some well-disposed men, in whom their country has5 great confidence, which has given a great sanction to their scheme of power. A comparison of the authority under which the convention acted, and their form of government will shew that they have despised their delegated power, and assumed sovereignty; that they have entirely annihilated the old confederation, and the particular governments of the several states, and instead thereof have established one general government that is to pervade the union; constituted on the most unequal principles, destitute of accountability to its constituents, and as despotic in its nature, as the Venetian aristocracy; a government that will give full scope to the magnificent designs of the well-born; a government where tyranny may glut its vengeance on the low-born, unchecked by an odious bill of rights: as has been fully illustrated in my two preceding numbers;6 [58]and yet as a blind upon the understandings of the people, they have continued the forms of the particular governments, and termed the whole a confederation of the United States, pursuant to the sentiments of that profound, but corrupt politician Machiavel, who advises any one who would change the constitution of a state, to keep as much as possible to the old forms; for then the people seeing the same officers, the same formalities, courts of justice and other outward appearances, are insensible of the alteration, and believe themselves in possession of their old government.7 Thus C�sar, when he seized the Roman liberties, caused himself to be chosen dictator (which was an ancient office) continued the senate, the consuls, the tribunes, the censors, and all other offices and forms of the commonwealth; and yet changed Rome from the most free, to the most tyrannical government in the world. The convention, after vesting all the great and efficient powers of sovereignty in general government, insidiously declare by section 4th of article 4th, �that the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union, a republican form of government;� but of what avail will be the form, without the reality of freedom. The late convention in the majesty of its assumed omnipotence, have not even condescended to submit the plan of the new government to the consideration of the people, the true source of authority; but have called upon them by their several constitutions,8 to �assent to and ratify�(a) in toto, what they have been pleased to decree; just as the grand monarque of France requires the parliament of Paris to register his edicts without revision or alteration, which is necessary previous to their execution. The authors and advocates of the new plan, conscious that its establishment can only be obtained from the ignorance of the people of its true nature, and their unbounded confidence in some of the men concurring; have hurried on its adoption with a precipitation that betrays their design: before many had seen the new plan, and before any had time to examine it; they by their ready minions, attended by some well-disposed but mistaken persons, obtained the subscriptions of the people to papers expressing their entire approbation of, and their wish to have it established; thus precluding them from any consideration: but lest the people should discover the juggle, the elections of the state conventions, are urged on at very early days; the proposition of electing the convention for this state in nine days after the date of the resolution for all counties east of Bedford, and supported by three or four of the deputies of the convention, and who were also members of the then assembly, is one of the most extravagant instances of this kind;9 and even this was only prevented by the secession of nineteen virtuous and enlightened [59]members.(b)10 In order to put the matter beyond all recal, they have proceeded a step further, they have made the deputies nominated for the state convention for this city and elsewhere, pledge their sacred honor, previous to their election, that they would implicitly adopt the proposed government, in toto;11 thus short as the period is before the final fiat is to be given, consideration is rendered nugatory, and conviction of its dangers or impropriety unavailable. A good cause does not stand in need of such means; it scorns all indirect advantages and borrowed helps, and trusts alone to its own native merit and intrinsic strength: the lion is never known to make use of cunning, nor can a good cause suffer by a free and thorough examination�It is knavery that seeks disguise. Actors do not care that any one should look into the tiring room, nor jugglers or sharpers into their hands or boxes. Every exertion has been made to suppress discussion by shackling the press; but as this could not be effected in this state, the people are warned not to listen to the adversaries of the proposed plan, lest they should impose upon them, and thereby prevent the adoption of this blessed government. What figure would a lawyer make in a court of justice, if he should desire the judges not to hear the counsel of the other side, lest they should perplex the cause and mislead the court? Would not every bystander take it for granted, that he was conscious of the weakness of his client�s cause, and that it could no otherwise be defended, than by not being understood? All who are friends to liberty are friends to reason, the champion of liberty, and none are foes to liberty but those who have truth and reason for their foes. He who has dark purposes to serve, must use dark means: light would discover him, and reason expose him: he must endeavor to shut out both, and make them look frightful by giving them ill names. Liberty only flourishes where reason and knowledge are encouraged; and wherever the latter are stifled, the former is extinguished. In Turkey printing is forbid, enquiry is dangerous, and free speaking is capital; because they are all inconsistent with the nature of the government. Hence it is that the Turks are all stupidly ignorant and are all slaves. I shall now proceed in the consideration of the construction of the proposed plan of government.�By section 4th of article 1st of the proposed government it is declared, �that the times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.� Will not this section put it in the power of the future Congress to abolish the suffrage by ballot, so indispensible in a free government�Montesquieu [60]in his spirit of laws vol. 1 page 12, says �that in a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty, but by the suffrages of the people, which are their will; now the sovereigns will is the sovereign himself. The laws therefore which establish the right of suffrage, are fundamental to this government. In fact it is as important to regulate in a republic, in what manner, by whom, and concerning what, suffrages are to be given, as it is in a monarchy to know who is the Prince and after what manner he ought to govern.�12 This valuable privilege of voting by ballot, ought not to rest on the discretion of the government, but be irrevocably established in the constitution. Will not the above quoted section, also authorise the future Congress, to lengthen the term for which the senators and representatives are to be elected, from 6 and 2 year respectively, to any period, even for life? As the parliament of England voted themselves from trienniel to septeniel; and as the long parliament under Charles the 1st became perpetual? Section 8th of article 1st, vests Congress with power �to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel evasions;13 to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.��This section will subject the citizens of these states to the most arbitrary military discipline, even death may be inflicted on the disobedient; in the character of militia, you may be dragged from your families and homes to any part of the continent and for any length of time, at the discretion of the future Congress; and as militia you may be made the unwilling instruments of oppression, under the direction of government; there is no exemption upon account of conscientious scruples of bearing arms; no equivalent to be received in lieu of personal services. The militia of Pennsylvania may be marched to Georgia or New-Hampshire however incompatible with their interests or consciences;�in short they may be made as meer machines as Prussian soldiers. Section the 9th begins thus.��The migration or importation of such persons, as any of the states, now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress, prior to the year 1808, but a duty or tax may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person.� And by the fifth article this restraint is not to be removed by any future convention. We are told that the objects of this article, are slaves, and that it is inserted to secure to the southern states, the right of introducing negroes for twenty-one years to come, against the [61]declared sense of the other states to put an end to an odious traffic in the human species; which is especially scandalous and inconsistant in a people, who have asserted their own liberty by the sword, and which dangerously enfeebles the districts, wherein the laborers are bondmen. The words dark and ambiguous;14 such as no plain man of common sense would have used, are evidently chosen to conceal from Europe, that in this enlightened country, the practice of slavery has its advocates among men in the highest stations. When it is recollected that no poll tax can be imposed on five negroes, above what three whites shall be charged; when it is considered, that the impost on the consumption of Carolina field negroes, must be trifling, and the excise, nothing, it is plain that the proportion of contributions, which can be expected from the southern states under the new constitution, will be very unequal, and yet they are to be allowed to enfeeble themselves by the further importation of negroes till the year 1808. Has not the concurrence of the five southern states (in the convention) to the new system, been purchased too dearly by the rest, who have undertaken to make good their deficiencies of revenue, occasioned by their wilful incapacity, without an equivalent? The general acquiescence of one description of citizens in the proposed government, surprises me much; if so many of the Quakers have become indifferent to the sacred rights of conscience, so amply secured by the constitution of this commonwealth; if they are satisfied, to rest this inestimable privilege on the discretion of the future government; yet in a political light they are not acting wisely; in the state of Pennsylvania, they form so considerable a portion of the community, as must ensure them great weight in the government; but in the scale of general empire, they will be lost in the ballance.15 I intended in this number to have shewn from the nature of things, from the opinions of the greatest writers and from the peculiar circumstances of the United States, the impracticability of establishing and maintaining one government on the principles of freedom in so extensive a territory; to have shewn, if practicable, the inadequacy of such government, to provide for its many and various concerns; and also to have shewn that a confederation of small republics, possessing all the powers of internal government, and united in the management of their general and foreign concerns, is the only system of government, by which so extensive a country can be governed consistent with freedom: but a writer under the signature of Brutus, in the New-York paper, which has been re-published by Messrs. Dunlap and Claypoole, has done this in so masterly a manner, that it would be superfluous in me to add any thing on this subject.16 My fellow citizens, as a lover of my country, as the friend to mankind, whilst it is yet safe to write, and whilst it is yet in your power to avoid it, I warn you of the impending danger. To this remote quarter of the world, has liberty fled�Other countries now subject to slavery, were once as free as we yet are; therefore for your own sakes, for the sake of your posterity, as well as for that of the oppressed of all nations, cherish this remaining asylum of liberty. Philadelphia, November 5th, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Wat Tyler,,Pennsylvania Herald,,10/24/1787,"WHEREAS it hath been represented unto us that many evil disposed men, enemies to our person and authority, have, after great deliberation, devised, and do with strong reason and persuasion recommend unto the people of these states a certain plan or frame of government, evidently calculated to subvert the antient principles of our administration, and to introduce the odious doctrines of national power, honor, and respectability: AND WHEREAS it is the interest and duty of all our true and faithful subjects and friends to oppose, counteract, and defeat this dangerous and diabolical innovation upon the anarchy of our dominion, THEREFORE we have thought fit, by and with the advice of our dearly beloved Cousins Jack Straw, Daniel Shays, and John Franklin; to issue this our vagrant proclamation, requiring and commanding all and every of our subjects and friends aforesaid, and more especially such of them as are judges, counsellors, accomptants, constables, and public officers of every denomination, to be zealous and vigilant in their efforts to undermine and destroy the baneful system which has been projected as aforesaid. And in our great anxiety for the preservation of those rights and privileges which have ever been held sacred by the freest of all commonwealths, a mob, we earnestly recommend to as many of our learned subjects as have acquired the art or mystery of writing, the necessary task of depreciating, traducing, and defaming: for, as the silly prejudice with which men regard a virtuous character is apt to make them value the action for the sake of the agent, it will be in vain to attempt the destruction of this iniquitous work, till it is proved, at least, that the authors were fools and dotards, who did not understand, or knaves and traitors who would not promote, the welfare of their country. Having then, neither spared age for its wisdom, or patriotism for its worth, it is our will and pleasure that our most clamorous subjects do proceed, in the next place, to the natural resources of our domination, and oppose to the inglorious dictates of truth and reason, the inexhaustible artillery of impudent assertion and daring falsehood. Let it be remembered that few men comprehend the science of government, and that, destitute of judgment, the people are only to be influenced by their passions. Hence arises the expediency of resorting to sound instead of sense; and of bewildering the imagination with visionary terrors, instead of instructing the understanding with rational disquisition, or candid interpretation. It is well known to most of our faithful subjects, that in former times a text of scripture, dexterously quoted, has inflamed the minds of mankind to the most frantic enthusiasm; and our affectionate and illustrious servant, Lord George Gordon,2 has lately demonstrated, that the stalking horse of religion may yet be exercised with excellent advantage in the cause of tumult and sedition. We do therefore, above all, recommend to our well disposed and industrious adherents, the selection of such phrases and sentences as have hitherto excited popular admiration; and that, without regard to the natural correspondence of causes and effects the destruction of the rights and liberties of the nation be inferred, from the means which are employed to secure and preserve them. Thus it may be argued, that because no power is given by the projected plan to controul the freedom of the press, therefore the projected plan is calculated to destroy the freedom of the press: because the federal representation of the people will possess the power to declare in what civil cases the trial shall be by jury, therefore the trial by jury is abolished in all civil cases: because the power of raising troops for the national protection and defence is delegated to the Congress of the United States, therefore the people, and Congress who are a part of the people, will be butchered and enslaved by a standing army: because the several state governments are, from time to time, and at all times to elect and appoint persons to fill the offices of the federal government, therefore the several state governments must be eventually annihilated�with many other similar propositions as fairly and as conclusively deduced from their respective premises. With these instructions, and confiding in the zeal, faith, and perseverance of our liege subjects, and of all men who know how to estimate the blessings of anarchy and licentiousness, and who wisely prefer their own temporary interests, to the permanent welfare of the public, we earnestly commend you to the countenance and support of the great father of all sedition, whose triumph over harmony and peace has established an everlasting kingdom. DONE at our CABBIN at TIOGA on the 5th day of November (being the anniversary of the fatal discovery of the glorious gun powder plot) annoque domini, 1787. Test: JACK CADE.3 MAT. TYLER."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/27/1787,"Mr. printer, This is certainly a very important crisis to the people of America; experience seems to have convinced every one, that the articles of confederation, under which Congress have hitherto attempted to regulate the affairs of the United States, are insufficient for the purposes intended; that we are a ruined people unless some alteration can be effected. The public mind has therefore been raised to the highest pitch of expectation, and the evident need of relief from the many distresses, public and private, in which we are involved has reduced us to such a state, that we can hardly endure a disappointment. Scarcely any thing that could be proposed by the convention, in this state of people�s [498]minds, would fail of being eagerly embraced. Like a person in the agonies of a violent disease, who is willing to swallow any medicine, that gives the faintest hope of relief; the people stood ready to receive the new constitution, in almost any form in which it could be presented to them. The zealous supporters of the proposed constitution, seem to be not unwilling to avail themselves of this disposition: and therefore it is strongly inculcated, that if we do not adopt this constitution, we shall not be able to establish another, but be left to our present weakness, confusion and distress. If I was pursuaded that this is really the case, I hardly know whether I should vote for rejecting any government however unfriendly to the liberties of the people, which promised to give vigour to the councils of this country; for any government is better than none. However, I do not see that it is by any means impracticable, for us yet to correct such errors and imperfections, as appear to exist in the proposed constitution; and whilst there is a possibility of procuring a better constitution, it is the duty of every good man to accomplish it. By the proposed constitution, every law, before it passes, is to undergo repeated revisions; and the constitution of every state in the union provide, for the reversion of the most trifling laws, either by their passing through different houses of assembly and senate, or by requiring them to be published for the consideration of the people. Why then is a constitution which affects all the inhabitants of the United States, which is to be the foundation of all laws and the source of misery or happiness to one quarter of the globe; why is this to be so hastily adopted or rejected, that it cannot admit of a revision?�If a law to regulate highways, requires to be liesurely considered and undergo the examination of different bodies of men, one after another, before it be passed, why is it that the framing of a constitution for the government of a great people; a work which has been justly considered as the greatest effort of human genius, and which, from the beginning of the world has so often baffled the skill of the wisest men in every age, shall be considered as a thing to be thrown out, in the first shape which it may happen to assume? Where is the impracticability of a revision? Cannot the same power which called the late convention, call another? Are not the people still their own masters? If, when the several state conventions come to consider this constitution, they should not approve of it, in its present form, they may easily apply to Congress and state their objections. Congress may as easily direct the calling another convention, as they did the calling the last. The plan may then be reconsidered, deliberately received and corrected; so as to meet the approbation of every friend to his country. A few months only will be necessary for this purpose; and if we consider the magnitude of the object, we shall deem it well worth a little time and attention�It is much better to pause and reflect beforehand, than to repent when it is too late; when no peaceable remedy will be left us, and unanimity will be forever [499]banished. The struggles of the people against a bad government, when it is once fixed, afford but a gloomy picture in the annals of mankind. They are often unfortunate, they are always destructive of public and and private happiness; but the peaceable consent of a people to establish a free and effective government, is one of the most glorious objects that is ever exhibited in the theatre of human affairs. Some I know, have objected, that another convention will not be likely to agree upon any thing�I am far however from being of that opinion. The public voice cries so loudly for a new constitution, that I have no doubt we shall have one of some sort.�My only fear is, that the impatience of the people will lead them to accept the first that is offered them, without examining whether it is right or wrong; and after all, if a new convention cannot agree upon any amendments in the constitution, which is at present proposed, we can still adopt this in its present form; and all further opposition being vain, it is to be hoped we shall be unanimous in endeavouring to make the best of it. The experiment is at least worth trying, and I shall be much astonished, if a new convention called together for the purpose of revising the proposed constitution, do not greatly reform it. I find that a number of pens are employed, in pointing out the defects in the proposed constitution�Without descending therefore, into minute particulars, I shall confine the remainder of my observations in this letter, to one or two of the most important considerations. It is beyond a doubt that the new federal constitution, if adopted, will in a great measure destroy, if it do not totally annihilate, the separate governments of the several states. We shall, in effect, become one great Republic.�Every measure of any importance, will be Continental.�What will be the consequence of this? One thing is evident�that no Republic of so great a magnitude, ever did, or ever can exist. But a few years elapsed, from the time in which ancient Rome extended her dominions beyond the bounds of Italy, until the downfal of her Republic; and all political writers agree, that a Republican government can exist only in a narrow territory: but a confederacy of different Republics has, in many instances, existed and flourished for a long time together�The celebrated Helvetian league, which exists at this moment in full vigor, and with unimpaired strength, whilst its origin may be traced to the confines of antiquity, is one, among many examples on this head; and at the same time furnishes an eminent proof of how much less importance it is, that the constituent parts of a confederacy of Republics may be rightly framed than it is, that the confederacy itself should be rightly organized;�for hardly any two of the Swiss cantons have the same form of government, and they are almost equally divided in their religious principles, which have so often rent asunder the firmest establishments. A confederacy of Republics must be the establishment in America, or we must cease altogether to retain the Republican [500]form of government. From the moment we become one great Republic, either in form or substance, the period is very shortly removed, when we shall sink first into monarchy, and then into despotism.�If there were no other fault in the proposed constitution, it must sink by its own weight. The continent of North-America can no more be governed by one Republic, than the fabled Atlas could support the heavens. Is it not worthy a few months labour, to attempt the rescuing this country from the despotism, which at this moment holds the best and fairest regions of the earth in thraldom and wretchedness?�To attempt the forming a plan of confederation, which may enable us at once to support our continental union with vigor and efficacy, and to maintain the rights of the separate states and the invaluable liberty of the subject? These ideas of political felicity, to some people, may seem like the visions of an Utopian fancy; and I am persuaded that some amongst us have as little disposition to realize them, as they have to recollect the principles, which inspired us in our revolt from Great-Britain. But there is at least, this consolation in aiming at excellence, that, if we do not obtain our object, we can make considerable progress towards it.�The science of politics has very seldom had fair play. So much of passion, interest and temporary prospects of gain are mixed in the pursuit, that a government has been much oftener established, with a view to the particular advantages or necessities of a few individuals, than to the permanent good of society. If the men, who, at different times, have been entrusted to form plans of government for the world, had been really actuated by no other views than a regard to the public good, the condition of human nature in all ages would have been widely different, from that which has been exhibited to us in history. In this country perhaps we are possessed of more than our share of political virtue. If we will exercise a little patience, and bestow our best endeavours on the business, I do not think it impossible, that we may yet form a federal constitution, much superior to any form of government, which has ever existed in the world;�but, whenever this important work shall be accomplished, I venture to pronounce, that it will not be done without a careful attention to the framing of a bill of rights. Much has been said and written, on the subject of a bill of rights;�possibly without sufficient attention to the necessity of conveying distinct and precise ideas of the true meaning of a bill of rights. Your readers, I hope, will excuse me, if I conclude this letter with an attempt to throw some light on this subject. Men when they enter into society, yield up a part of their natural liberty, for the sake of being protected by government. If they yield up all their natural rights they are absolute slaves to their governors. If they yield up less than is necessary, the government is so feeble, that it cannot protect them.�To yield up so much, as is necessary for the purposes of government; and to retain all beyond what is necessary, is the great [501]point, which ought, if possible, to be attained in the formation of a constitution. At the same time that by these means, the liberty of the subject is secured, the government is really strengthened; because wherever the subject is convinced that nothing more is required from him, than what is necessary for the good of the community, he yields a chearful obedience, which is more useful than the constrained service of slaves.�To define what portion of his natural liberty, the subject shall at all times be entitled to retain, is one great end of a bill of rights. To these may be added in a bill of rights some particular engagements of protection, on the part of government, without such a bill of rights, firmly securing the privileges of the subject, the government is always in danger of degenerating into tyranny; for it is certainly true, that �in establishing the powers of government, the rulers are invested with every right and authority, which is not in explicit terms reserved.��Hence it is, that we find the rulers so often lording over the people at their will and pleasure. Hence it is that we find the patriots, in all ages of the world, so very solicitous to obtain explicit engagements from their rulers, stipulating, expressly, for the preservation of particular rights and privileges. In different nations, we find different grants or reservations of privileges appealed to in the struggles between the rulers and the people, many of which in the different nations of Europe, have long since been swallowed up and lost by time, or destroyed by the arbitrary hand of power. In England we find the people, with the Barons at their head, exacting a solemn resignation of their rights from king John, in their celebrated magna charta, which was many times renewed in Parliament, during the reigns of his successors. The petition of rights was afterwards consented to by Charles the first, and contained a declaration of the liberties of the people. The habeus corpus act, after the restoration of Charles the Second, the bill of rights, which was obtained from the Prince and Princess of Orange on their accession to the throne and the act of settlement, at the accession of the Hanover family, are other instances to shew the care and watchfulness of that nation, to improve every opportunity, of the reign of a weak prince, or the revolution in their government, to obtain the most explicit declarations in favor of their liberties. In like manner the people of this country, at the revolution, having all power in their own hands, in forming the constitutions of the several states, took care to secure themselves by bills of rights, so as to prevent, as far as possible, the encroachments of their future rulers upon the rights of the people. Some of these rights are said to be unalienable, such as the rights of conscience: yet even these have been often invaded, where they have not been carefully secured by express and solemn bills and declarations in their favor. Before we establish a government, whose acts will be the supreme law of the land, and whose power will extend to almost every case [502]without exception, we ought carefully to guard ourselves by a bill of rights, against the invasion of those liberties which it is essential for us to retain, which it is of no real use to government to strip us of; but which in the course of human events have been too often insulted with all the wantonness of an idle barbarity."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/27/1787,"A correspondent says that the brave Colonel George Mason, of Virginia, who nobly said that he would sooner cut off his hand than sign the new constitution, of the United States, deserves high praise; he should consider that time is only wanting to manifest the proposed constitution to be an odious system of tyranny, and therefore that his manly conduct will be attended with a growing fame; but if his conduct were not to be attended with the applauses which he is going to receive, he should consider that, as a celebrated poet expresses himself, One self approving hour, whole years outweighs, Of stupid starers, and of loud hazzas."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/27/1787,"A correspondent informs us, that a gentleman of veracity who arrived here (from Charleston) last Friday on his way to New-York, brings the following intelligence, viz. That trade is now in a very good way there, and that though great quantities of rice and indigo is raised, yet such is the demand from foreign markets for these articles, that they bare a great price; for before the war the price of rice was but six shillings their currency (which is near sterling) and now it brings from twelve to fourteen shillings per cwt. which is more than double; and that they had received the new constitution—that their newspapers had been employed this some time past by foreign and domestic essays against it—and that it was not expected that a convention would be called till May or June, and that only for revising and amending it—as it had few advocates of any consequence in its present shape."
Newspaper,No,A Federal Republican,,,,10/28/1787,"Friends and Fellow-Countrymen; When any nation is about to make a change in its political character, it highly behoves it to summon the experience of ages that have past, to collect the wisdom of the present day, and ascertain clearly those just principles1 of equal government, that are adapted to secure inviolably the lives, the liberties, and the property of the people. In such a situation are these United States at the present moment.-They are now called to announce the Alpha or the Omega of their political existence, to lay a deep foundation for their national character, and to leave a legacy of happiness or misery to their children's children.-The Constitution recommended to the consideration of the United States, is a subject of general discussion; and, while it involves in its fate the interest of so extensive a country, every sentiment that can be offered upon it, deserves its proportion of the public attention.-It is worth our while, before we make any observations on the Constitution, as it stands recommended, to recur to the motives which gave rise to the calling of a Convention. We were taught by sad experience, the defect of the present articles of confederation, arid wisely determined to alter and amend them. At the framing of the present confederation, the bond of union among the States, which arose from a community of danger, in some measure superseded the necessity of wisdom. A common interest excited us to unite our exertions for the public good. At such a time a system of government conceived in perfect wisdom, and adopted with deliberation, was not expected; and as soon as those common principles which supplied its defects, ceased to operate, the inconveniences which arose from them, were very sensibly felt. Since that time the seeds of civil dissention have been gradually ripening, and political confusion hath pervaded the States. Commerce hath been declining, our credit suffering, and our respectability, as a nation, hath almost vanished. In such circumstances it was thought proper to collect the patriotic wisdom of the States for the purpose of amending the articles of confederation, which were found to be inadequate to the security of national prosperity and happiness; and of making such additions to supreme power, as our situation testified, were wanted. Necessity, therefore, gave birth to the Convention, and the glaring defects of the late system confederation, were the objects of its amendment. But was it a total subversion of the confederation, that was intended by Congress or expected by the people? Anyone tolerably acquainted with human nature, can easily discern, that people involved in difficulty, would embrace any change, even if it were evidently and designedly for the worse. But this circumstance ought not to preclude examination. Did we experience any disadvantage from every part of the present confederation?- And why alter that which experience itself hath taught us to be good? Was it not expected that some necessary additions to the powers of Congress, together with a few alterations of a smaller nature would constitute the whole of their business? To frame a Constitution entirely new therefore was out of their province. This is not offered as an argument against the Constitution itself but it would certainly have been wisdom to have reserved that which was known to be good, and to have amended that only which was found defective from experience. But notwithstanding that, if the proposed constitution can be made [to] appear to be excellent in itself, and properly adapted to secure inviolably the rights and privileges of the people; it is the part of every honest man to wish its establishment. But that upon examination it will be found to be otherwise, I am fully persuaded. We shall proceed to offer some sentiments on the Constitution proposed for the acceptance of the United States. In doing this, we shall endeavour to state most of the objections which have been made, and collect their force into one point of view. It may be proper to take some notice of an opinion that has been offered to the public. It is said by some, that after having delegated the best and wisest men in our country for the purpose of framing Constitution for the United States, it would be only presumption to offer any objections to it. This doctrine holds up to view an excess of humility. Any errors which we may imagine to exist in the Constitution, we are to resolve into our own incapacity to fathom them. It is true that we ought to rely much upon the wisdom of those patriots who composed the late Convention; but surely the people for whom they acted have an undoubted right to offer such objections as they may suppose to exist, and that for the purpose of having them accurately solved by more enlightened understandings. It is the part of the doubtful to enquire, and of the wise to answer and instruct. It is from this principle, and this only, that I now offer my thoughts on the subject. Besides the nature and importance of the thing shew the propriety of impartial discussion. If it be true also, that no public deliberative assembly, however wise, is perfectly uninfluenced by secular interest; but that all are in some degree subject to those temporary relapses from prudence, which passion occasions, we may very naturally suppose that some parts of this Constitution are tinctured with correspondent partiality and weakness. Nature is seldom over-awed by wisdom, and she often times draws her own picture in opposition to the constraint of education. We may without derogating from the characters of the members of Convention, expect to find defects in the Constitution which they have framed; and if the scrutiny of the public eye, viewing it in an infinite variety of lights can discern them, the motives must be dishonorable that prevent the communication of them. On this subject much hath2 been published. Most of those pieces, however, which are said to be in favour of the Constitution, are only penegyrics, or those parts which are good, and to which no objections have been made. Mr. Wilson's speech does not come under this description. It was composed in a masterly manner with strength and judgment. In it he has endeavoured to obviate some objections that have been offered to the public. It may be that the force of his arguments is not fully felt; but I think it will appear to anyone whose understanding is not immediately refined, that the writer who stiles himself the Democratic F�deralist is more than equal to him. The Centinel has ably proposed many objections which have not been yet satisfactorily futed. Probably some of them exist beyond contradiction. The author of a pamphlet, stiled, Remarks on the Address of the Sixteen Members of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, has indeed touched upon many objections, and then dismissed them. His whole performance is Coloured with the ridiculous. He is no doubt a friend to Shaftsbury's position, and feels that it is easier to laugh than to reason. There is another pamphlet written by a citizen of America in favour of the Constitution. The author of this deserves much for his style and plausibility of expression. He has made many excellent and wise remarks upon the Constitution. He has instituted a comparison between it and that of Rome and England. He points out several defects in the system of policy amongst the old Romans and modern Britons, and shews with some judgment the superior excellence of the proposed Constitution in its correspondent parts. But this is by no means proving that there are no errors in it. Some objections he has indeed partially considered, but the chief of the piece, which is good in itself, consists in encomiums on those parts which are unexceptionable. His mode comparison is not just. Wealth and extent of territory have an immediate relation to government. The manners and customs of the people are closely connected with their government. Experience testifies that the manners and habits of the people in their several graduations to refinement have ever controuled their policy. The excellent Montesquieu3 himself observes, that the manners and customs of the people have an intimate connection with their laws. In a comparison therefore, all these things ought to be considered. The same system of policy that might have been excellent in the government of antiquity, would not probably do at the present day. The question which should be agitated is not whether the proposed constitution be better or worse than those that have from time to time existed; but whether it be in every respect adapted to secure our liberty and happiness at the present stage of the world. There is one circumstance in the sitting of the late Convention, which bears upon its face the colour of suspicion. It adds one to the many examples of the truth of the common adage (which is founded in a pro- pensity of human nature) that all who have power are fond of executinge it. They have power to controul the manner of their convening, and they did it indeed in a very suspicious way. They excluded themselves as it were from the view of the public, and an injunction of secrecy was imposed on the members. This might have been done to blunt the natural jealousy of the people; but it was depriving them of a guard to their liberties, which they should ever possess. Whatever were there intentions in shutting out their proceedings from the public ear, it carried in it a suspicious appearance. But this is a matter small in itself, and for the honor and respect which we profess to entertain for the members of Convention, we are bound to believe that their motives in this particular were honorable, decent and wise. reviewing the proposed Constitution, the first thing that strikes us is the division of the legislative authority into two branches. I think that after mature deliberation, this will be acknowledged to be prudent arid wise. Yet what some writers have observed upon it is not perfectly true. They have deduced their advantages from improper positions. In the division of the legislative power, bad bills will probably be passed, but more good ones will be opposed. In forming a just nexus imperii, this ought always to take place. It is better that many good bills should be destroyed than that a single bad one should be permitted to pass. Were it not for this circumstance, there would be little advantage. For although the passion of the one might sometimes be controuled by the coolness of the other; yet the passion of the latter might sometimes counteract the wisdom of the former. Experience however shows it to be wise to divide the legislative power between two distinct bodies. The next thing that presents itself to view, is the representation of the states. In the second section of the first article it is said, that representations and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may5 be included in this union according to their respective members, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States; and within every subsequent term of ten years in such a manner as they shall by law direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand; but each state shall have at least one representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New-Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-lsland and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New-Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North-Carolina five, South-Carolina five, and Georgia three. Here it is evident the representation is too scanty. There is a certain corrective balance to be preserved, not only between different houses, but also between the members that compose the same house. This is often times of very great use. It tends to keep alive a spirit of more accurate discussion. But with such a paucity of members, this advantage can never be experienced. Besides what thirty thousand men would be willing to have one man represent them. It borders indeed upon injustice. Among thirty thousand people there must of necessity be a variety of classes, each having distinct and separate concerns, to which some respect would most certainly be due. Among such a number of men there will naturally be so many different ratios of interest to which their feelings are alive, and with which their happiness is intimately connected, that they should by all means be regarded. It would indeed be frivolous to attend to the most minute circumstantial divisions of interest; but in such a number as thirty thousands there must be divisions of a larger and more important nature, which are entitled to respect. But in the clause before-mentioned, there is a more material error; an error which essentially effects the rights of some states. It is the inequality representation in the lower house. This particular has not yet been agitated. In forming confederation of independent republican states, it hath always been esteemed fundamental law, that each state should have an equal representation. In forming the present confederation of the United States,6 this point was warmly urged by several learned gentlemen, and carried in Congress. Here is a change of which the citizens of the United States, who are less governed by principles of private interest, than those of true and impartial justice should beware. The articles of the present confederation in this particular, are much more near akin to justice. They are not so highly coloured with lawful oppression. In the fifth article it is said, that, in determining questions of the United-States in Congress assembled, each state shall have one vote. This is founded in reason, and its propriety is evinced by experience, from both of which it is very easy to prove, that representation among seperate independent states should be equal. What is oftentimes observed upon this subject has very little meaning or force. What, shall one state that is wealthier than another, that exceeds it in extent of territory, and has a far greater interest in national decisions, have no more weight in them? Shall (for instance) the state of Delaware or Rhode-Island have an equal voice with that of Virginia or Massa- chusetts? Here is an apparent, though a very superficial difficulty. The superior weight of large states does not, and ought not to consist in a greater number representatives. There is an unavoidable influence arising from circumstances, which of itself forms the superiority. It is evident that a larger and richer state must of necessity have its influence over a smaller in a due proportion. But the establishing superiority by law in the inequality representatives among the states, is a kind of a constitutional reduction to slavery. Its superior influence exists in nature, and therefore it is unnecessary, and indeed abusive to establish it by law. The representation of seperate independent states is exactly similar to the votes of individuals. Rich citizens, who have large and valuable possessions are much more effected by public decisions than those of little or no fortune. Yet is a rich citizen entitled to a greater number of votes than one who is poor? No, because in the very nature of things he is known to influence many poor men. Influence will generally be in proportion to abilities and wealth. The same principle may be applied to states with equal propriety. The larger and wealthier have a necessary and unavoidable influence over the smaller and less wealthy. Examples to verify this assertion are numerous, and among the number there is one the more striking from its bearing so great a resemblance to the American states. The United Netherlands, or States of Holland, form a glaring example. Every state in the union has an equal voice, and yet is it not evident that Holland is as superior in influence as she is in wealth and extent? This arises from the nature of the thing. Although an equal voice is decreed by the constitution to each state, yet that of Holland has swallowed up the wealth, the power, and even the name. Many more instances might be adduced, but the general system of things teaches us the propriety of admitting each state to an equal representation. It is said, however, that the small states will eagerly adopt the constitution proposed by the Convention. This I am inclined to doubt, but taking it for granted we can easily account for it. Their present situation is so bad, and their importance so inconsiderable, that of two evils they would willingly chuse that which is apparently the least. But let them have time to discuss and consider the matter, and recollect the probable perpetuity of it, and they will not so hastily embrace it. There are many reasons why small states would rather adopt this constitution, than run the risque of having none at all. In the former case, their importance would at least be nominal, in the latter it would dwindle away to nothing. It may be urged that the danger arising from the inequality of representation in the lower house, is sufficiently guarded against by the equality in the senate. Be that as it may, the thing is essentially wrong in itself. There is a mutual dependence between the two houses, and each has its proportion of influence. No circumstance can alter the intrinsic injustice of the thing. The more such inequality takes place, the more direct is the avenue to tyranny. The other grand defect in the foregoing clause, we shall defer for the present, and treat it in the sequel. In the third section of the first article it is said, that the senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof for six years. Then follows a mode of division amongst them into three classes,7 of which the first is to resign its place at the expiration of the second year, the second the fourth year and the third the sixth year. This may in itself be an excellent thing, and well adapted to preserve a proper degree of experiental wisdom in the senate at all times. That class which retains its seat for six years, will in many respects have a superiority. This being the case, the manner of determining the classes should have been stated; otherwise the jealousy of the states may rouse the animosity of party division to such a pitch as to endanger the springs of government. If a proper mode of dividing were pointed out, the division itself might be of great use. The fourth section of the first article says, that the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time make or alter such regulations except as to the place of chuing senators. Here the mode of expression seems to be designedly ambiguous. It carries in it, however, a controuling power to be vested in Congress over the states in those matters that don't at all concern the nation at large. The power is limited-except as to the place of chusing senators-This I suppose was excepted because the senators are to be chosen by the legislature of each state. Indeed it would be an odd affair to have the legislatures of the several states collected together for the purpose of chusing senators in any place that Congress should appoint. But why is not the same provision made in the case of representatives? They are to be chosen by the people at large in each state-but is it an easier matter to draw the body of the people in any state into one place than their legislative body only? There may be some hidden propriety in this distinction, which it requires political vision very much refined to discern. I could wish to see it clearly pointed out. This refers, however, only to place-but what is meant by the manner of holding elections? If we are to understand by it the mode of electing, to give Congress power to controul it is infringing upon one of those privileges upon which freedom itself is suspended. The manner of electing is clearly pointed out by the excellent Montesquieu, and he considers it as a fundamental law in every republican state. While the people of the several states, who are alone concerned in it, have the free exercise of their will, they will adhere to this law; but to oblige them to resign it to a power whom it very little interests, is almost to oblige them to sell their birthright. A writer upon this subject, who signs himself an American Citizen, considers this matter very strangely; he supposes it to be a guard against the possibility of obstinacy in any state-as in the case of Rhode-Island. This then is designed for a political antidote, in case of refusal in anyone state to elect at all. But this is a very absurd supposition-for it is very evident that where there is no election, there can be neither time, place nor manner of holding it. The clause in the constitution takes for granted some election, but his construction supposes none at all. The eighth section of the first article appears upon consideration to be big with unnecessary danger. It seems to reduce humanity to too great a test. It bloats Congress with too much power, and leaves them without a guard to prevent the eruptions of human depravity.9 The very first clause contains every species of power that they could possibly be vested with. In it power is given them to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay debts, and to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. This power may, if exerted in its extent, reduce the several states to poverty and nothing. We would willingly pay a compliment to human nature by supposing the best, experience did not rise up against us. The wisdom of many nations hath induced them to enlarge voluntarily the powers of their rulers; but we have no instances of such self-denial in governors as hath led them to restrain their own power and abridge their own authority. It was wisdom in this country to appoint a convention for the purpose of enlarging the powers of Congress; but it will be superior wisdom to give them no more power than is sufficient. Our situation taught us the necessity of enlarging the powers of Congress for certain national purposes, where the deficiency was experienced. Had these and these only been added, experience itself would have been an advocate for the measure. But in the proposed constitution there is an extent of power in Congress, of which I fear neither theory nor practice will evince the propriety or advantage. The power of internal taxation given to Congress in the foregoing clause, is a very unjust and improper one. It has been hinted in some publication, that impost will defray all our national expences. This is a proposition perfectly absurd. Will not the support of a standing army, a navy, &c. be a prodigious addition to national expence? To say that this government will not be an additional expence to the country, is an assertion to which common sense would never assent. Let it be remembered, that this constitution, if adopted, will create a vast number of expensive offices. Most of them will be of the national character, and must be supported with a superior degree of dignity and credit; without regarding the enormous expence which Congress may incur if they please. The many places that will and must be created and paid for, will add much to the burden of our debts. In the legislative, executive, and particularly the judiciary department, there will be a multiplicity of officers hitherto unknown, and the salaries annexed to them must be very considerable. Besides, if the states are to retain even a shadow of sovreignty, the expence thence arising must also be defrayed. This combination will cause a greater demand than can easily be answered. The gentleman who remarks upon the address of the sixteen members, answers this objection with uncommon sagacity. The first objection is, (says he) that the government proposed will be too expensive. I answer that, if the appointment of offices are not more, and the compensation or emoluments of office not greater than is necessary, the expence will be by no means burdensome, and this must be left to the prudence of Congress: for I know no way to controul supreme power from extingenciesm in this respect. What does all this amount to, but an oblique confession, that Congress may, if they please, load us with many needless expences? The taxation of the particular states for their own support will be over-ruled by Congress, or else it will be obliged to embrace a measure perhaps the most odious in the world, viz. excessive taxation. This would be widely different from the opinion of the ablest politicians. I am persuaded that if this constitution were to be adopted, Congress would be reduced to this alternative, either to oppress the people in the manner just hinted, or commit upon them a violent injury by depriving them of their rights. Congress will be the judges of what is necessary for the general welfare of the United States, and this will open the door to any extravagant expence which they shall be pleased to incur. For this reason their power should have been accurately defined. Baron Montesquieu observes that the real wants of the people ought never to give way to the imaginary wants of the state. Imaginary wants are those which flow from passion, and from the weakness of the governors, from the charms of an extraordinary project, from a distempered desire of vain glory, and from a certain impotency of mind that renders it incapable of withstanding the attacks of fancy. Often times has it happened, that ministers of restless dispositions have imagined that the wants of the state were those of their own little and ignoble souls. That this may hap- pen here, we have a right, and indeed ought to suppose. Any man who carefully attends to the constitution quoted above, must judge that the powers granted by it, are too indifinite. Indeed as it stands there expressed, it includes every other power afterwards mentioned.10 We come now to speak of a standing army. By this constitution, the Congress have power to declare war, as also to raise and support armies; but no appropriation of money for that purpose shall be for a longer term than two years. We are to suppose that12 Congress is a representation of the people of the United States at large; if so, the nexus imperii even of the English constitution is lost. There the king has only the power of declaring war, and the house of parliament, that of raising money for the support of it. So that it seems to be wrong to give Congress this combined power independent of a check from a majority of the state legislatures. No appropriation of money for this purpose shall be for a longer term than two years. This is not very moderate. The space of time is only as long again as that permitted in England, for the same purpose. But a standing army in time of peace is strongly to be objected to. It always hath been and always will be the grand machine made use of to subvert the liberties of free states. Pisistratus and Caesar are not forgotten. It ought to be laid down as a principle that free states should never keep a standing army for the support of its laws. They ought (as Brutus says) to depend for their support upon the citizens. And when a government is to receive its support from the aid of the citizens, it ought to be so constructed to have the confidence, respect and affection of the people. Men who upon the call of the magistrate, offer themselves to execute the laws, are influenced to do it from affection for the government or from fear; when a standing army is at hand to punish offenders, every man is actuated by the latter principle, and therefore, when the magistrate calls, will obey. Fear however is a contracting principle of obedience. But when this is not the case, the government must rest for its support upon the confidence and respect which the people have for their government and laws If therefore the government of the United States be just and equal, and the states are to retain their seperate powers, a standing army is useless and dangerous. It will inevitably sow the seeds corruption and depravity of manners. Indolence will increase, and with it crimes cannot but increase. The springs of honesty will gradually grow lax and chaste, and severe manners be succeeded by those that are dissolute and vicious. Where a standing army is kept up, virtue never thrives. In this particular experience will abundantly testify what the nature of the thing would suggest. Whatever the refine- ment of modern politics may inculcate, it still is certain that some degree of virtue must exist, or freedom cannot live. Unless Mandervill's position be embraced, that private vices are public benefits: a standing army will work the destruction of these states. Virtue and simplicity of manners in an extensive country by their innate energy and vigour, create a healthy constitution, and command prosperity to accompany it; but vice like a sickly air, debilitates the nerves of the political body, and withers all its bloom. A standing army will increase vice, and that a disunion of interest and affections. It is this that weakens the force, and destroys the harmony of free states. These evils in process of time will be derived from a standing army, and when we shall have outlived our virtue, every effort to recover it, will be vain and abortive. The propriety and advantage of a standing army can be but poorly vindicated. My fellow citizens, beware of such pretences, and while this tyrannical monster of depravity exists in the plan, do not adopt it, unless you are willing to entail upon your children the miseries of vice, and leave to posterity the corrupted relics of a shattered government. The next thing which we proceed to, is the importation of slaves, contained in the ninth section of the first article. It says, that the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed upon such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person. The truth is, (says a citizen of America) Congress cannot prohibit the importation of slaves during that period; but the laws against the importation of them into any particular state stand unrepealed. An immediate abolition of slavery would be ruin upon the whites and misery upon the blacks in the southern states. The constitution therefore hath wisely left each state to pursue its own measures with respect to this article of legislation during the period of twenty-one years. That the importation of slaves shall not be forbidden till that time may be very wise-but what hath that to do with the abolition of slavery? To prohibit the importation of slaves is not to abolish slavery. For all that is contained in this constitution, this country may remain degraded by this impious custom till the end of time. The next thing that strikes our attention in a review of the constitution is the disposition of the judicial powers. The first section of the third article says; that the judicial powers of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress shall from time to time establish. The judges both of the supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. This is certainly too indifinitely comprehensive. What inferior courts Congress shall be pleased to establish, is not known, nor can be imagined. Montesquieu is of opinion, that where the judicial power is not kept perfectly distinct from the legislative and executive, liberty is endangered. The Centinel quotes a clause from Blackstone, much to the purpose, which says, that if the power of judging were entirely trusted with the magistrates, or any select body of men, named by executive authority, there decisions in spite of their own natural integrity would have a bias towards those of their own rank and dignity; for it is not to be expected, that the few will be attentive to the rights of the many. This therefore preserves in the hands of the people, that power which they ought to have in the administration of justice, and prevents the encroachments of the most powerful and wealthy citizens. If this be true, what may not the judiciary come to under this constitution? It may gradually grow corrupted, till the very power of judging become the readiest tool in the work of tyranny. Drowsy justice may e'er long sit nodding on her rotten bench, and a collective despot smile upon the harpies of ravenous ambition. Such a despot must indeed have many friends, whose injustice in their way to glory, would readily be connived at. It is worth our while to enquire how far the proposed constitution will tend to reduce the dignity and importance of the states. The several states are by this constitution, to have a republican government guaranteed to them; but where is the use of such a position, when the powers granted to Congress must inevitably make it void? That the republican form here decreed to each state will indeed be only form, human nature as well as experience will evince.14 Let us attend to the three first articles in the constitution of Poland. 1. The crown of Poland shall be forever elective, and all order of succession provided; any person who shall endeavour to break this law, shall be declared an enemy to his country, and liable to be punished accordingly. 2. Foreign candidates to the throne, being the frequent cause of troubles and divisions shall be excluded; and it shall be enacted, that for the future, no person can be chosen king of Poland, and great duke of Lithuania, excepting native Pole, of noble origin, and possessing land within the kingdom. A son or grandson of a king of Poland, cannot be elected immediately after the death of their father or grandfather; and are not eligible excepting after an interval of two reigns. 3. The government of Poland shall be forever free independent, and of a republican form. What frenzy to talk of freedom and independence after the two first articles. The height and extent of this freedom and independence, experience has shown and will show. After a candid examination into the disposition of the legislative, executive and judicial authority of the United States, it will appear that the several states will have very little or no seperate internal policy, but will be all pressed into one compact system of government, of which they will only be parts. The want responsibility to the people among the representatives in this constitution, would furnish matter for ample discussion, but we pass over it in silence, only observing that it is a grand and indeed a daring fault, and one that sanctions with security the most tyrannic edicts of a despotic voice. Here, my fellow citizens, is a wide avenue to corruption, of which time will evince the danger. Which circumstance taking place; every species of venality must spread through the land with rapid progress. The contagion will not be confined to the higher classes; it will extend its baneful influence over all ranks and degrees of men. Thenceforward the security of property will be unhinged, andour most valuable rights will be held upon a precarious tenure. The judges of our property are named by the supreme, and his favour will be confined on those persons who lend their support perhaps to tyrannical measures. Hence the contagion of venality will pervade the seats of justice. It will be kept alive by gainful prospects; and every occasion solicitation in favour of a son or a brother, or any relation or friend, will be a fresh incitement to preserve the venal system in strength and vigor. It will not escape notice, that the determination of our property in the last resort, will, by the power decreed to the supreme, by this constitution, be lodged with persons, whom, corrupted, no dependence on the people will oblige to be jus The ministers of justice of all others should not be beyond the reach of the people. The same thing is true of political as of other machines. The utility of them does not increase with the complication of their parts. But provided the effect be the same, the more simple the better. The organization of this is evidently so complex that it will require much strength to put it in motion: and great care must be taken in the use of it, that the smaller parts be not broken to pieces. But I fear that no care can prevent the extinction of independence among the several states. The judicial power proposed to be granted by this constitution, goes far to produce this effect. The powers of the supreme courts and of such inferior courts, as Congress shall be pleased to ordain, are exceedingly comprehensive. It comprises all civil cases, except those which arise between citizens of the same state. That the judicial power of each state will sink into nothing, will easily be seen. Suppose, for instance that Congress be pleased to ordain or establish one of these inferior federal courts in each state. The consequence will be that the others will be nullified. The courts are to be under the sanction of the United States of America, not of a particular state. They must be supported with dignity, and their judges and other necessary officers will have their salaries stated by Congress which will be paid out of the treasury of the United States. In this situation, we can easily foresee that in the common and unavoidable course of things, the courts established by subordinate power supported with less splendor and dignity, will at length dwindle into nothing. Another circumstance should be attended to: The States will be exceedingly strained to support them. Most of the ways and means as they are called are entirely shut out from the State governments. The tenth section of the first article says, No state shall, without the consent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, &c. &c. the net produce of all such imposts and duties laid by any state on imports or exports, shall be for the use of the treasury of the United States, and all such laws shall be subjected to the revision and controul of Congress What then is to be the mode of raising money for defraying the expences of the state? It is reducing them to the necessity of laying direct taxes, which is egregiously abusive. Most of the states are already groaning under their taxes. Here the very idea of state is entirely done away. But on the other hand, the government of the United States has an enormous power of raising money in every way as well as that of contracting debts at pleasure. To give them the power of laying taxes, duties, imposts and excise, byway of providing for the welfare of the United States, and then constitute them judges of what is necessary for these purposes, is giving them power to satisfy at the expence of the states, any whim which ambition or the love ostentation might suggest to them.17 But yet every law thus made will be binding: for they have an additional power expressly granted them, to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all the powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof.18 This may from the mode of expression be construed into a tyrannical grant to enforce tyranny itself. Have the states in this predicament any kind of consequence or power, or are they not rather reduced to inactive parts of the same grand empire?19 But the very last clause but one in the constitution proves clearly that the whole country is to be comprised into one large system of lordly government. A tight system indeed. They say that this constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound by them or any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Here is at once created a fruitful source of contention and error. What end will there be to the confusion that will arise from the many laws or ordinances of Congress with respect to revenue, viz. taxes, duties imposts, &c. when those of the seperate states are to be controulled by them? But what judges are to be bound by them in all cases whatever, notwithstanding any laws to the contrary, that may have been promulgated by any particular state? The judges not only of those inferior federal courts which Congress may from time to time establish in any or all the states; but also the judges of the courts immediately dependent on the states themselves. They are to be over-ruled by the laws of Congress in every state, and the laws of every state must be prejudiced in their favor. Can any state, or the citizens of any state think themselves secure when they are conscious that their own laws will not avail them in competition with those of Congress? Suppose Congress in making its provision for the general welfare of the United States, and framing those laws which shall be deemed necessary and proper for carrying into execution all their powers, should, in the complex body of them, oppose the general system of state policy, what must be the consequence? It must be laid prostrate in the dust, and yield to the ordinances of Congress, and that according to their own mode of construing them. If this does not open the door to violent oppression, it at least pours upon us a load of inconveniencies. I know it is said that all the powers of Congress must be exercised for the general welfare, and have for their object general concerns only. But what are these general concerns? May they not without difficulty be construed2021 to the prejudice of particular concerns?22 Such a construction will certainly follow from the present indefinite mode expression in this constitution. There is a writer upon the subject who attempts to explain the intentions of the convention in constituting the powers of Congress. He says that, the first object of the constitution is to unite the states into one compact society for the purpose of government. If such union must exist or the states be exposed to foreign invasion, internal discord, reciprocal encroachments on eachother's property -to weakness and infamy, which no person will deny-what powers must be collected and lodged in the supreme head or legislature of these states? The answer is easy. The legislature must have exclusive jurisdiction in all matters where the states have a mutual interest. There are some regulations in which all the states are equally concerned- there are others which in their operations are limited to one state. The former belong to Congress, the latter to the respective legislatures. No one state has a right to supreme controul in any affair in which the other states have an interest; nor should Congress interfere in any affair which respects one state only. This is the general line of division which the convention have endeavoured to draw between the powers of Congress and the rights of individual states. The states in their seperate capacity cannot provide for their common defence, nay, in case of a civil war, one state cannot secure its existence. The only question therefore is, whether it is necessary to unite and provide for the general welfare? For this question being once answered in the affirmative, leaves no room to doubt the propriety constituting a power over the United States, adequate to these general purposes. This was spending time in vain, for it is known, and are invincibly acknowledged that the power of Congress should extend to every case where the interests of the United States are clearly found to be mutual. But pray cannot Congress, after having ascertained this union of interests, and constituted proper powers in all cases to which it applies, proceed one step farther and form an over-ruled system of government in the country, in this compact situation? Is there not a wide difference between just constituting powers adequate to general purposes, and proceeding regularly beyond it to the establishing of a supreme authority over the states in this collective view? The distinction is wide and apparent. Upon a candid examination it will be found that the combination of them both exists in the constitution. It hath been said that the objection with respect to the freedom of the Press is not valid, because the power controuling that is lodged with the several states. A little consideration will show that this, though perhaps just in itself, is but a specious pretext.23 Congress have power to lay all duties of whatever kind, and although they could not perhaps directly bar the freedom of the Press, yet they can do it in the exercise of the powers that are expressly decreed to them. Remember there are such things as stamp duties and that these will as effectually abolish the freedom of the press as any express declaration. It is said however, that the legislatures of the several states will not dwindle away, because they have the sole right of electing the senate. This indeed is all, and such as it is, it will not last long. Ladislaus of Poland, who was elected emperor24 after the temporary reign of Sigismund, having relinquished the right of imposing taxes, called an assembly of prelates, barons, and military gentlemen, in their respective provinces, in order to obtain an additional tribute. The provincial assemblies gave birth to the dietines; which now no longer retain the power ofraising money in their several districts, but only elect the nuncios or representatives for the diet. And is it expected that when the legislatures of the states are reduced to mere boards of electors, they will long continue so? No, this last dreg of power will at length vanish. Nominal power is always a disgrace unsupported by reality. That our boasted republic will ere long wear the face of an aristocracy may easily be seen. The foundation of the Venetian aristocracy is well known. The city was divided into six districts, called sestiers. The council of forty proposed that each of these partitions should name two electors, amounting to twelve in all, who should have the power of choosing from the whole city four hundred and twenty, who should have the whole power of the general assembly, and be called the grand council. The people were amused with fine promises and order of regularity, and consoled with assertions that their right of election still continued, and that those who should not be chosen one year, might be the next, and not perceiving that this law would be fatal to their power, suffered that aristocracy to be thus founded, which exists to this hour. The next proposal was that a committee of eleven should be appointed to name the doge. Though the design of reducing the people to nothing might have been easily seen in these manoeuvres, yet the people wearied, irritated, and discouraged by eternal discords, agreed to both. Thus easy may be the gradation of these states. The proposed constitution is evidently not calculated to coalesce with human nature in another respect. The executive, as vested in the president is too pointedly supreme. The fears of the people will and ought easily to be agitated by such an extent of power in a single man; particularly, if the situation of that man be such as will easily permit any gratification of partiality or ambition. Suppose we ask the question, whether it would not be better to substitute in the room of a single executive magistrate, a sovereign executive council, consisting of one counsellor chosen from each state by the executive thereof, with a president of such council, who should be only primus inter pares to be chosen from among themselves by the joint ballot of the council and senate, or the former only? This council to have the appointment of all officers under the federal government, instead of the senate a 26nd president, the former 27of which should have no executive or other powers whatever in that department; but should act merely in a legislative capacity, in conjunction with the house representatives. There is another idea to be suggested, that in just policy no money bill should be altered or amended in anyway by the senate. But the correction of one part is precluded by an error in another; for here the inequality representation28 in the lower house rises29 into view, and prevents our observing any thing further. Upon the whole, it is evident that this constitution carries in its figure the strongest features of political ambition, beneath the charming delusion of a fair complexion. It hath been made an objection to this constitution, that the legislative and executive are not kept perfectly distinct and seperate. This, I think, is not valid. The executive should have a check on the legislative for this simple reason-that the executive hath its own limits- but the legislative independent of it, would have none at all. To make laws is unconfined and indefinite, but to execute them when made, is limited by their existence. But from the executive's having an undue influence over the legislative, I must confess, I have a great aversion. The division among the senators is unintelligible. The next thing that we come to 31speak of, is the mode of laying taxes. All direct taxes are to be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers. This is a great and a fundamental error. Direct taxes should always be apportioned32 according to extent of territory. In framing the present confederation in 1778, this was held to be an essential point. Article 8th says, all charges of war and other expences which shall be incurred for the common defence and general welfare, and allowed for by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of the common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several states in proportion to the value of land in each state, &c. The value of land in a country increases with its riches, and therefore forms a just criterion. There are many reasons which might be offered to show that the number of inhabitants in any state is an improper measure apportioning taxes. The inhabitants of some states may be numerous and poor, and those of another, few and wealthy. The truth is, the ratios both of inhabitants and wealth, conspire to shew that the extent of territory is the only proper measure in apportioning taxes among the several states. Commerce creates wealth, but at the same time luxury and high life, and these again a decrease of inhabitants. The luxury that is derived from commercial wealth always tends to stop population. From this it clearly appears that the apportioning of taxes according to numbers is not just. On the contrary, the state of agriculture is more favourable to population, but not to wealth. Indeed land must, in the nature of things, afford a just measure. It is true that the value of land is dependent on circumstances. But the richer the country grows, the more valuable the land. The extent of land in Massachusetts is small in proportion to its inhabitants, but yet it is more valuable-in Virginia it is very great in proportion to the inhabitants, but yet it is not so valuable. Let direct taxes be apportioned according to the value of land in each state, and it must be just for this reason, that the value of land always increases in an exact proportion to the riches of the country.Hitherto we have been considering the blemishes of the constitution as they statedly exist-other objects are derived from omission. Among these the grand one, upon which is indeed suspended every other, is the omission of a bill of rights. The remarker upon the address of the sixteen members has answered their objection with much force. I answer (says he) this is not true, it contains a declaration of many rights, and very important ones, i.e. that people shall be obliged to fulfil their contracts, and not avoid them by tenders of any thing less than the value stipulated-that no ex post facto laws shall be made, &c. The gentleman has here very wittily mistaken the sense of the two terms right and obligation. They are correlative terms, and between two parties, whenever the former applies to the one, the latter of necessity applies to the other. Whatever anyone has a right to expect from me, I am obliged to render him. He might as well have said that the constitution gave the people a right to submit to Congress in every thing, and that we have a right to pay the last farthing compliance to their despotic whims. What he mentions is the enforcing of obligation and not the declaring of right. One of the learned members of the late convention-the honorable Mr. Wilson observes in his speech, that all powers which are not by the constitution given up to Congress, are reserved for the disposition of the several states. This observation is wise and true, because properly speaking it should be so. In entering into the social compact, all rights which are not expressly given up to the governors are reserved to the people. That it is so from a just construction it is easy to discover. But notwithstanding, if the people are jealous of their rights, where will be the harm in declaring them? If they be meant as they certainly are to be reserved to the people, what injury can arise from a positive declaration of it? Although in reasoning it would appear to be unnecessary, yet if the people prefer having their rights stately defined, it is certainly reasonable, that it should be done. I am well acquainted with the logical reason, that is general given for it. It is said that the insertion of a bill of rights, would be an argument against the present liberty of the people. To have the rights of the people declared to them, would imply, that they had previously given them up, or were not in possession of them. This indeed is a distinction of which the votaries of scholastic philosophy might be proud-but in the political world, where reason is not cultivated independently of action and experience, such futile distinctions ought not to be agitated. In fact, it does not exist, for should think, it is as rational to declare the right of the people to what they already possess, as to decree to them any new rights. If the people do really possess them, there can be no harm in expressing what is meant to be understood. A bill of rights should either be inserted, or a declaration made, that whatever is not decreed to Congress, is reserved to the several states for their own disposal. In this particular, the articles of the present confederation have an evident advantage. The second article says, that each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power jurisdiction, and right,34 which is not by this confederation expressly declared to United States in Congress assembled. This will appear the more proper, if we consider that these are rights in which all the states are concerned. It is thought proper to delegate to Congress supreme power on all occasions where the natural interests of the states are concerned, and why not for the same reason grant and declare to the states a bill of those rights which are also mutual? At any rate it is certain that no injury can arise from it, and to do it, would be satisfactory and wise. On the whole, my fellow-citizens, this constitution was conceived in wisdom; the thanks of the United States are justly due to the members of the late convention. But let their productions pass again through the furnace. Do not give them even the opportunity of depriving you of your rights and privileges, and that without breaking over any restraint imposed by the constitution. Because this once granted they will be fully enabled in the present age to lay the gentle foundation of despotic power, and after a temporary interval of seeming humanity between you and succeeding generations, to rivet upon them the chains of slavery beyond the possibility of a rupture. To guard against this, I could wish to see the proposed constitution revised and corrected. If the States are not to be confederated, let them be reduced to one compact body. And if a perfect consolidation of the States is to take place, if the people are to become the source of power, and if Congress is to represent them as the head of this grand body politic, in the name of all that is dear to freemen, permit not the veins through which the life of government itself is to flow from the heart to the head, be anyway obstructed-let the passages be free & open that vital heat may animate every limb. That if all the States were to offer their objections, the constitution would be reduced to nothing, is an ill founded idea. The good natured simularity which the citizen of America discovered between this constitution and a piece of painting, is perfectly erroneous. All painting is addressed to the sense and relished by taste which is various and fluctuating-but this constitution is addressed to the understanding, and judged of by reason which is fixed and true. The constitution is for the most part good, and perhaps many of the objections which have been made to it, arise from our not being able to discern clearly the collective interest of the states. Some of them however, in all probability exist beyond contradiction. Let the convention of each State make its exceptions, then let a future and general one receive them all, and reconcile them with as much wisdom as possible. This would certainly be some refinement. It could do no harm, but might do much good. To conclude, my friends and fellow-citizens, have the proposed constitution revised, corrected and amended-have every dubious expression be made plain and clear-have every power accurately defined and well understood,35 and your own rights and privileges clearly stated, or a declaration made that all powers that are not by this constitution delegated to Congress, are reserved for your own disposal.36 Then and not till then, will impartial justice rule over our land, and America become the theatre of equity and wisdom, as she has already been the field of patriotism and bravery. This once obtained, we shall be happy and free, and having enjoyed the blessings of peace and plenty under the ample shade of the tree of liberty, we shall deliver them down unimpaired by the corrosive influence of time to the latest posterity.

Newspaper,No,Lycurgus,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/29/1787,"A writer on the Federal Constitution in the Centinel of the 20th inst. tells us a story of Dr. Franklin’s confidence of General Pepperell’s expedition against Cape-Breton, in 1746; and when the Dr. was interrogated, with regard to the ground of his confidence: gave the following, viz. that all the praying people were on his side; from which this writer concludes—that the new Government of the United States will be adopted, since the ministers, and christians of all denominations are now ingaged in praying for it; and there is good reason to believe that no prayers have as yet been offered against it. 1 I was really in hopes that my eyes would not have been disobliged any more with an observation of so ill natured an aspect.—Has it come to this, that no person of any denomination is a Christian, except those who pray for the adoption of the proposed Federal Constitution? If that constitution is as good as its most zealous devotees can imagine, I can by no means suppose that it will be considered at the last day (or ought to be at any other time) as a test of Christianity. In a free government all such scurrilous reflections cannot be perused without horror, nor the author thought of without pity as well as contempt; and the man who, when a question of the utmost consequence is before the public for their discussion and examination, shall presume [162]publickly to unchristianize all such as do not pray for their particular system would do well to consider, whether his approbation will do any service to any system which he may espouse. For my part I am rejoiced to see the different systematicks offer their sentiments to the public, and the reasons which induce them to embrace such sentiments; and I take it to be a priviledge which of right they ought to enjoy, and a duty which they ought to perform. If the constitution is good, it can receive no damage from examination, but will, like silver, by rub[b]ing appears brighter and brighter, and the people be led to accept of the same with more unanimity, for its being fully investigated and understood: But if it will not bear examination no person of the least degree of honest intentions can wish it adopted; and that person (let his station in life be ever so dignified or his occupation be what it may) who wishes to prevent an open, free, candid, and impartial examination of such a momentous question, discovers a disposition better calculated for the Meridian of Constantinople than America, and would make a better figure as a Janizary than a member of a free republican government.

Newspaper,No,John Humble,,Independent Gazetteer,,10/29/1787,"The humble address of the lowborn of the United States of America, to their fellow slaves scattered throughout the world—greeting. Whereas it hath been represented unto us that a most dreadful disease hath for these five years last past infected, preyed upon, and almost ruined the government and people of this our country; and of this malady we ourselves have had perfect demonstration, not mentally, but bodily, through every one of the five senses; for although our sensations in regard to the mind be not just so nice as those of the wellborn; yet our feeling, through the medium of the plow, the hoe, and the grubbing axe, is as acute as any nobleman’s in the world. And whereas a number of skilled physicians having met together at Philadelphia last summer for the purpose of exploring and, if possible, removing the cause of this direful disease have, through the assistance of John Adams, Esquire, in the profundity of their great political knowledge, found out and discovered that nothing but a new government consisting of three different branches, namely king, lords, and commons, or in the American language, President, Senate, and Representatives, can save this our country from inevitable destruction, And whereas it hath been reported that several of our lowborn brethren have had the horrid audacity to think for themselves in regard to this new system of government, and, dreadful thought! have wickedly began to doubt concerning the perfection of this evangelical Constitution, which our political doctors have declared to be a panacea, which (by inspiration) they know will infallibly heal every distemper in the Confederation and finally terminate in the salvation of America. Now we the lowborn, that is, all the people of the United States except 600 or thereabouts wellborn, do by this our humble address, declare and most solemnly engage that we will allow and admit the said 600 wellborn immediately to establish and confirm this most noble, most excellent and truly divine Constitution. And we further declare that without any equivocation or mental reservation whatever we will support and maintain the same according to the best of our power, and after the manner and custom of all other slaves in foreign countries, namely by the sweat and toil of our body. Nor will [206]we at any future period of time ever attempt to complain of this our royal government, let the consequences be what they may. And although it appears to us that a standing army, composed of the purgings of the jails of Great Britain, Ireland and Germany, shall be employed in collecting the revenue of this our king and government; yet, we again in the most solemn manner declare, that we will abide by our present determination of nonassistance and passive obedience; so that we shall not dare to molest or disturb those military gentlemen in the service of our royal government. And (which is not improbable), should any one of those soldiers when employed on duty in collecting the taxes, strike off the arm (with his sword) of one of our fellow slaves, we will conceive our case remarkably fortunate if he leaves the other arm on. And moreover because we are aware that many of our fellow slaves shall be unable to pay their taxes, and this incapacity of theirs is a just cause of impeachment of treason; wherefore in such cases we will use our utmost endeavors, in conjunction with the standing army, to bring such atrocious offenders before our federal judges, who shall have power without jury or trial, to order the said miscreants for immediate execution. Nor will we think their sentence severe unless after being hanged they are also to be both beheaded and quartered. And finally we shall henceforth and forever leave all power, authority, and dominion over our persons and properties in the hands of the wellborn, who were designed by Province to govern. And in regard to the liberty of the press, we renounce all claim to it forever more. Amen. And we shall in future be perfectly contented if our tongues be left us to lick the feet of our wellborn masters. Done on behalf of three millions of lowborn American slaves. John Humble, secretary."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/1/1787,"mr. printer, In order that people may be sufficiently impressed, with the necessity of establishing a bill of rights in the forming of a new constitution, it is very proper to take a short view of some of those liberties, which it is of the greatest importance for Freemen to retain to themselves, when they surrender up a part of their natural rights for the good of society. The first of these, which it is of the utmost importance for the people to retain to themselves, which indeed they have not even the right to surrender, and which at the same time it is of no kind of advantages to government to strip them of, is the liberty of conscience. I know that a ready answer is at hand, to any objections upon this head. We shall be told that in this enlightened age, the rights of conscience are perfectly secure: There is no necessity of guarding them; for no man has the remotest thoughts of invading them. If this be the case, I beg leave to reply that now is the very time to secure them.�Wise and prudent men always take care to guard against danger beforehand, and to make themselves safe whilst it is yet in their power to do it without inconvenience [539]or risk.�who shall answer for the ebbings and flowings of opinion, or be able to say what will be the fashionable frenzy of the next generation? It would have been treated as a very ridiculous supposition, a year ago, that the charge of witchcraft would cost a person her life in the city of Philadelphia; yet the fate of the unhappy old woman called Corbmaker, who was beaten�repeatedly wounded with knives�mangled and at last killed in our streets, in obedience to the commandment which requires �that we shall not suffer a witch to live,� without a possibility of punishing or even of detecting the authors of this inhuman folly, should be an example to warn us how little we ought to trust to the unrestrained discretion of human nature.2 Uniformity of opinion in science, morality, politics or religion, is undoubtedly a very great happiness to mankind; and there have not been wanting zealous champions in every age, to promote the means of securing so invaluable a blessing. If in America we have not lighted up fires to consume Heretics in religion, if we have not persecuted unbelievers to promote the unity of the faith, in matters which pertain to our final salvation in a future world, I think we have all of us been witness to something very like the same spirit, in matters which are supposed to regard our political salvation in this world. In Boston it seems at this very moment, that no man is permitted to publish a doubt of the infalibility of the late convention, without giving up his name to the people, that he may be delivered over to speedy destruction;3 and it is but a short time since the case was little better in this city. Now this is a portion of the very same spirit, which has so often kindled the fires of the inquisition: and the same Zealot who would hunt a man down for a difference of opinion upon a political question which is the subject of public enquiry, if he should happen to be fired with zeal for a particular species of religion, would be equally intolerant. The fact is, that human nature is still the same that ever it was: the fashion indeed changes; but the seeds of superstition, bigotry and enthusiasm, are too deeply implanted in our minds, ever to be eradicated; and fifty years hence, the French may renew the persecution of the Huguenots, whilst the Spaniards in their turn may become indifferent to their forms of religion. They are idiots who trust their future security to the whim of the present hour. One extreme is always apt to produce the contrary, and those countries, which are now the most lax in their religious notions, may in a few years become the most rigid, just as the people of this country from not being able to bear any continental government at all, are now flying into the opposite extreme of surrendering up all the powers of the different states, to one continental government. The more I reflect upon the history of mankind, the more I am disposed to think that it is our duty to secure the essential rights of the people, by every precaution; for not an avenue has been left unguarded, [540]through which oppression could possibly enter in any government; without some enemy of the public peace and happiness improving the opportunity to break in upon the liberties of the people; and none have been more frequently successful in the attempt, than those who have covered their ambitious designs under the garb of a fiery zeal for religious orthodoxy. What has happened in other countries and in other ages, may very possibly happen again in our own country, and for aught we know, before the present generation quits the stage of life. We ought therefore in a bill of rights to secure, in the first place, by the most express stipulations, the sacred rights of conscience. Has this been done in the constitution, which is now proposed for the consideration of the people of this country?�Not a word on this subject has been mentioned in any part of it; but we are left in this important article, as well as many others, entirely to the mercy of our future rulers. But supposing our future rulers to be wicked enough to attempt to invade the rights of conscience; I may be asked how will they be able to effect so horrible a design? I will tell you my friends�The unlimited power of taxation will give them the command of all the treasures of the continent; a standing army will be wholly at their devotion, and the authority which is given them over the militia, by virtue of which they may, if they please, change all the officers of the militia on the continent in one day, and put in new officers whom they can better trust; by which they can subject all the militia to strict military laws, and punish the disobedient with death, or otherwise, as they shall think right: by which they can march the militia back and forward from one end of the continent to the other, at their discretion; these powers, if they should ever fall into bad hands, may be abused to the worst of purposes. Let us instance one thing arising from this right of organizing and governing the militia. Suppose a man alledges that he is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing Arms.�By the bill of rights of Pennsylvania he is bound only to pay an equivalent for his personal service.4�What is there in the new proposed constitution to prevent his being dragged like a Prussian soldier to the camp and there compelled to bear arms?�This will depend wholly upon the wisdom and discretion of the future legislature of the continent in the framing their militia laws; and I have lived long enough to hear the practice of commuting personal service for a paltry fine in time of war and foreign invasion most severely reprobated by some persons who ought to have judged more rightly on the subject�Such flagrant oppressions as these I dare say will not happen at the beginning of the new government; probably not till the powers of government shall be firmly fixed; but it is a duty we owe to ourselves and our posterity if possible to prevent their ever happening. I hope and trust that there are few persons at present hardy enough to entertain thoughts of creating any religious establishment for this country; although I have lately read a piece in the [541]newspaper, which speaks of religious as well as civil and military offices, as being hereafter to be disposed of by the new government; but if a majority of the continental legislature should at any time think fit to establish a form of religion, for the good people of this continent, with all the pains and penalties which in other countries are annexed to the establishment of a national church, what is there in the proposed constitution to hinder their doing so? Nothing; for we have no bill of rights, and every thing therefore is in their power and at their discretion. And at whose discretion? We know not any more than we know the fates of those generations which are yet unborn. It is needless to repeat the necessity of securing other personal rights in the forming a new government. The same argument which proves the necessity of securing one of them shews also the necessity of securing others. Without a bill of rights we are totally insecure in all of them; and no man can promise himself with any degree of certainty that his posterity will enjoy the inestimable blessings of liberty of conscience, of freedom of speech and of writing and publishing their thoughts on public matters, of trial by jury, of holding themselves, their houses and papers free from seizure and search upon general suspicion or general warrants; or in short that they will be secured in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property without depending on the will and pleasure of their rulers. If we pass over the consideration of this subject so essential to the preservation of our liberties, and turn our eyes to the form of the government which the Convention have proposed to us, I apprehend that changing the prospect will not wholly alleviate our fears.�A few words on this head, will close the present letter. In the first place the office of President of the United States appears to me to be clothed with such powers as are dangerous. To be the fountain of all honors in the United States, commander in chief of the army, navy and militia, with the power of making treaties and of granting pardons, and to be vested with an authority to put a negative upon all laws, unless two thirds of both houses shall persist in enacting it, and put their names down upon calling the yeas and nays for that purpose, is in reality to be a king as much a King as the King of Great Britain, and a King too of the worst kind;�an elective King.�If such powers as these are to be trusted in the hands of any man, they ought for the sake of preserving the peace of the community at once to be made hereditary.�Much as I abhor kingly government, yet I venture to pronounce where kings are admitted to rule they should most certainly be vested with hereditary power. The election of a King whether it be in America or Poland, will be a scene of horror and confusion; and I am perfectly serious when I declare that, as a friend to my country, I shall despair of any happiness in the United States until this office is either reduced to a lower pitch of power or [542]made perpetual and hereditary.�When I say that our future President will be as much a king as the king of Great-Britain, I only ask of my readers to look into the constitution of that country, and then tell me what important prerogative the King of Great-Britain is entitled to, which does not also belong to the President during his continuance in office.�The King of Great-Britain it is true can create nobility which our President cannot; but our President will have the power of making all the great men, which comes to the same thing.�All the difference is that we shall be embroiled in contention about the choice of the man, whilst they are at peace under the security of an hereditary succession.�To be tumbled headlong from the pinnacle of greatness and be reduced to a shadow of departed royalty is a shock almost too great for human nature to endure. It will cost a man many struggles to resign such eminent powers, and ere long, we shall find, some one who will be very unwilling to part with them.�Let us suppose this man to be a favorite with his army, and that they are unwilling to part with their beloved commander in chief; or to make the thing familiar, let us suppose, a future President and commander in chief adored by his army and the militia to as great a degree as our late illustrious commander in chief; and we have only to suppose one thing more, that this man is without the virtue, the moderation and love of liberty which possessed the mind of our late general, and this country will be involved at once in war and tyranny. So far is it from its being improbable that the man who shall hereafter be in a situation to make the attempt to perpetuate his own power, should want the virtues of General Washington; that it is perhaps a chance of one hundred millions to one that the next age will not furnish an example of so disinterested a use of great power. We may also suppose, without trespassing upon the bounds of probability, that this man may not have the means of supporting in private life the dignity of his former station; that like Caesar, he may be at once ambitious and poor, and deeply involved in debt.�Such a man would die a thousand deaths rather than sink from the heights of splendor and power into obscurity and wretchedness. We are certainly about giving our president too much or too little; and in the course of less than twenty years we shall find that we have given him enough to enable him to take all. It would be infinitely more prudent to give him at once as much as would content him, so that we might be able to retain the rest in peace; for if once power is seized by violence not the least fragment of liberty will survive the shock. I would therefore advise my countrymen seriously to ask themselves this question;�Whether they are prepared to receive a king? If they are to say at once, and make the kingly office hereditary; to frame a constitution that should set bounds to his power, and, as far as possible secure the liberty of the subject. If we are not prepared to receive a king, let us call another convention to [543]revise the proposed constitution, and form it anew on the principles of a confederacy of free republics; but by no means, under pretence of a republic, to lay the foundation for a military government, which is the worst of all tyrannies."
Letter,Yes,Francis Murray,John Nicholson,,,11/1/1787,"I must acknowledge to you that I am greatly changed in regard of my sentiments of the proposed Federal Constitution since I saw you last. And it is in a great measure owing to the Centinel No. 2, the Old Whig No. 2 and 3, and to your pamphlet which I have read; and am well assured that if the election was deferred for four or five weeks longer, a different return for Convention would take place, not only in this county but throughout the states.2 There is a few of us [who] had a first meeting but have not come to a determination either to run a new ticket (little hopes of carrying of it as the Quakers are entirely in favor of the new Constitution) or entirely to stay at home and not vote. N.B. I [have] just been reading the fourth letter of the Old Whig [208page icon][and] the Democratic Federalist�s and am pleased with both and should like something done like the plan proposed by M.C."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/5/1787,"To the people of Pennsylvania John 3d, verse 20th��For every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.� But �there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid that shall not be known. Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light: and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be proclaimed on the housetops.� St. Luke, chap, xii, 2d and 3d verses. Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow Citizens! The formation of a good government, is the greatest effort of human wisdom, actuated by disinterested patriotism; but such is the cursed nature of ambition, so prevalent among men,1 that it would sacrifice every thing to its selfish gratification; hence the fairest opportunities of advancing the happiness of humanity, are so far from being properly improved, that they are too often converted to2 the votaries of power and domination, into the means of obtaining their nefarious ends. It will be the misfortune of America of adding to the number of examples of this kind, if the proposed plan of government should be adopted; but I trust, short as the time allowed you for consideration is, you will be so fully convinced of the truth of this, as to escape the impending danger: it is only necessary to strip the monster of its assumed garb, and to exhibit it in its native [56]colours, to excite the universal abhorrence and rejection of every virtuous and patriotic mind. For the sake of my dear country, for the honor of human nature, I hope and am persuaded, that the good sense of the people will enable them to rise superior to the most formidable conspiracy against the liberties of a free and enlightened nation, that the world has ever witnessed. How glorious would be the triumph! How it would immortalize the present generation in the annals of freedom! The establishment of a government, is a subject of such momentous and lasting concern, that it should not be gone into without the clearest conviction of its propriety; which can only be the result of the fullest discussion, the most thorough investigation and dispassionate consideration of its nature, principles and construction. You are now called upon to make this decision, which involves in it, not only your fate, but that of your posterity for ages to come. Your determination will either ensure the possession of those blessings, which render life desirable, or entail those evils which make existence a curse:�that such are the consequences of a wise or improper organization of government, the history of mankind abundantly testifies. If you viewed the magnitude of the object in its true light, you would join with me in sentiment, that the new government ought not to be implicitly admitted. Consider then duly before you leap, for after the rubicon is once passed, there will be no retract.3 If you were even well assured that the utmost purity of intention predominated in the production of the proposed government, such is the imperfection of human reason and knowledge, that it would not be wise in you to adopt it with precipitation in toto, for all former experience must teach you the propriety of a revision on such occasions, to correct the errors, and supply the deficiencies, that may appear necessary. In every government whose object is the public welfare, the laws are subjected to repeated revisions, in some by different orders in governments, in others by an appeal to the judgment of the people and deliberative forms of procedure. A knowledge of this, as well as of other states, will show that in every instance where a law has been passed without the usual precautions, it has been productive of great inconvenience and evils, and frequently has not answered the end in view, a supplement becoming necessary to supply its deficiencies. What then are we to think of the motives and designs of those men who are urging the implicit and immediate adoption of the proposed government; are they fearful, that if you exercise your good sense and discernment, you will discover the masqued aristocracy, that they are attempting to smuggle upon you, under the suspicious garb of republicanism?�When [57]we find that the principal agents in this business, are the very men who fabricated the form of government, it certainly ought to be conclusive evidence of their invidious design to deprive us of our liberties�The circumstances attending this matter, are such as should in a peculiar manner excite your suspicion; it might not be useless to take a review of some of them. In many of the states, particularly in this and the northern states, there are aristocratic junto�s of the well-born few, who had been zealously endeavouring since the establishment of their constitutions, to humble that offensive upstart, equal liberty; but all their efforts were unavailing, the ill-bred churl obstinately kept his assumed station. However, that which could not be accomplished in the several states, is now attempting through the medium of the future Congress.�Experience having shewn great defects in the present confederation, particularly in the regulation of commerce and marritime affairs; it became the universal wish of America to grant further powers, so as to make the federal government adequate to the ends of its institution. The anxiety on this head was greatly encreased, from the impoverishment and distress occasioned by the excessive importations of foreign merchandise and luxuries and consequent drain of specie, since the peace: thus the people were in the disposition of a drowning man, eager to catch at any thing that promised relief, however delusory. Such an opportunity for the acquisition of undue power, has never been viewed with indifference by the ambitious and designing in any age or nation, and it has accordingly been too successfully improved by such men among us. The deputies from this state (with the exception of two)4 and most of those from the other states in the union, were unfortunately of this complexion, and many of them of such superior endowments, that in an exparte discussion of the subject by specious glosses, they have gained the concurrence of some well-disposed men, in whom their country has5 great confidence, which has given a great sanction to their scheme of power. A comparison of the authority under which the convention acted, and their form of government will shew that they have despised their delegated power, and assumed sovereignty; that they have entirely annihilated the old confederation, and the particular governments of the several states, and instead thereof have established one general government that is to pervade the union; constituted on the most unequal principles, destitute of accountability to its constituents, and as despotic in its nature, as the Venetian aristocracy; a government that will give full scope to the magnificent designs of the well-born; a government where tyranny may glut its vengeance on the low-born, unchecked by an odious bill of rights: as has been fully illustrated in my two preceding numbers;6 [58]and yet as a blind upon the understandings of the people, they have continued the forms of the particular governments, and termed the whole a confederation of the United States, pursuant to the sentiments of that profound, but corrupt politician Machiavel, who advises any one who would change the constitution of a state, to keep as much as possible to the old forms; for then the people seeing the same officers, the same formalities, courts of justice and other outward appearances, are insensible of the alteration, and believe themselves in possession of their old government.7 Thus C�sar, when he seized the Roman liberties, caused himself to be chosen dictator (which was an ancient office) continued the senate, the consuls, the tribunes, the censors, and all other offices and forms of the commonwealth; and yet changed Rome from the most free, to the most tyrannical government in the world. The convention, after vesting all the great and efficient powers of sovereignty in general government, insidiously declare by section 4th of article 4th, �that the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union, a republican form of government;� but of what avail will be the form, without the reality of freedom. The late convention in the majesty of its assumed omnipotence, have not even condescended to submit the plan of the new government to the consideration of the people, the true source of authority; but have called upon them by their several constitutions,8 to �assent to and ratify�(a) in toto, what they have been pleased to decree; just as the grand monarque of France requires the parliament of Paris to register his edicts without revision or alteration, which is necessary previous to their execution. The authors and advocates of the new plan, conscious that its establishment can only be obtained from the ignorance of the people of its true nature, and their unbounded confidence in some of the men concurring; have hurried on its adoption with a precipitation that betrays their design: before many had seen the new plan, and before any had time to examine it; they by their ready minions, attended by some well-disposed but mistaken persons, obtained the subscriptions of the people to papers expressing their entire approbation of, and their wish to have it established; thus precluding them from any consideration: but lest the people should discover the juggle, the elections of the state conventions, are urged on at very early days; the proposition of electing the convention for this state in nine days after the date of the resolution for all counties east of Bedford, and supported by three or four of the deputies of the convention, and who were also members of the then assembly, is one of the most extravagant instances of this kind;9 and even this was only prevented by the secession of nineteen virtuous and enlightened [59]members.(b)10 In order to put the matter beyond all recal, they have proceeded a step further, they have made the deputies nominated for the state convention for this city and elsewhere, pledge their sacred honor, previous to their election, that they would implicitly adopt the proposed government, in toto;11 thus short as the period is before the final fiat is to be given, consideration is rendered nugatory, and conviction of its dangers or impropriety unavailable. A good cause does not stand in need of such means; it scorns all indirect advantages and borrowed helps, and trusts alone to its own native merit and intrinsic strength: the lion is never known to make use of cunning, nor can a good cause suffer by a free and thorough examination�It is knavery that seeks disguise. Actors do not care that any one should look into the tiring room, nor jugglers or sharpers into their hands or boxes. Every exertion has been made to suppress discussion by shackling the press; but as this could not be effected in this state, the people are warned not to listen to the adversaries of the proposed plan, lest they should impose upon them, and thereby prevent the adoption of this blessed government. What figure would a lawyer make in a court of justice, if he should desire the judges not to hear the counsel of the other side, lest they should perplex the cause and mislead the court? Would not every bystander take it for granted, that he was conscious of the weakness of his client�s cause, and that it could no otherwise be defended, than by not being understood? All who are friends to liberty are friends to reason, the champion of liberty, and none are foes to liberty but those who have truth and reason for their foes. He who has dark purposes to serve, must use dark means: light would discover him, and reason expose him: he must endeavor to shut out both, and make them look frightful by giving them ill names. Liberty only flourishes where reason and knowledge are encouraged; and wherever the latter are stifled, the former is extinguished. In Turkey printing is forbid, enquiry is dangerous, and free speaking is capital; because they are all inconsistent with the nature of the government. Hence it is that the Turks are all stupidly ignorant and are all slaves. I shall now proceed in the consideration of the construction of the proposed plan of government.�By section 4th of article 1st of the proposed government it is declared, �that the times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.� Will not this section put it in the power of the future Congress to abolish the suffrage by ballot, so indispensible in a free government�Montesquieu [60]in his spirit of laws vol. 1 page 12, says �that in a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty, but by the suffrages of the people, which are their will; now the sovereigns will is the sovereign himself. The laws therefore which establish the right of suffrage, are fundamental to this government. In fact it is as important to regulate in a republic, in what manner, by whom, and concerning what, suffrages are to be given, as it is in a monarchy to know who is the Prince and after what manner he ought to govern.�12 This valuable privilege of voting by ballot, ought not to rest on the discretion of the government, but be irrevocably established in the constitution. Will not the above quoted section, also authorise the future Congress, to lengthen the term for which the senators and representatives are to be elected, from 6 and 2 year respectively, to any period, even for life? As the parliament of England voted themselves from trienniel to septeniel; and as the long parliament under Charles the 1st became perpetual? Section 8th of article 1st, vests Congress with power �to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel evasions;13 to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.��This section will subject the citizens of these states to the most arbitrary military discipline, even death may be inflicted on the disobedient; in the character of militia, you may be dragged from your families and homes to any part of the continent and for any length of time, at the discretion of the future Congress; and as militia you may be made the unwilling instruments of oppression, under the direction of government; there is no exemption upon account of conscientious scruples of bearing arms; no equivalent to be received in lieu of personal services. The militia of Pennsylvania may be marched to Georgia or New-Hampshire however incompatible with their interests or consciences;�in short they may be made as meer machines as Prussian soldiers. Section the 9th begins thus.��The migration or importation of such persons, as any of the states, now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress, prior to the year 1808, but a duty or tax may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person.� And by the fifth article this restraint is not to be removed by any future convention. We are told that the objects of this article, are slaves, and that it is inserted to secure to the southern states, the right of introducing negroes for twenty-one years to come, against the [61]declared sense of the other states to put an end to an odious traffic in the human species; which is especially scandalous and inconsistant in a people, who have asserted their own liberty by the sword, and which dangerously enfeebles the districts, wherein the laborers are bondmen. The words dark and ambiguous;14 such as no plain man of common sense would have used, are evidently chosen to conceal from Europe, that in this enlightened country, the practice of slavery has its advocates among men in the highest stations. When it is recollected that no poll tax can be imposed on five negroes, above what three whites shall be charged; when it is considered, that the impost on the consumption of Carolina field negroes, must be trifling, and the excise, nothing, it is plain that the proportion of contributions, which can be expected from the southern states under the new constitution, will be very unequal, and yet they are to be allowed to enfeeble themselves by the further importation of negroes till the year 1808. Has not the concurrence of the five southern states (in the convention) to the new system, been purchased too dearly by the rest, who have undertaken to make good their deficiencies of revenue, occasioned by their wilful incapacity, without an equivalent? The general acquiescence of one description of citizens in the proposed government, surprises me much; if so many of the Quakers have become indifferent to the sacred rights of conscience, so amply secured by the constitution of this commonwealth; if they are satisfied, to rest this inestimable privilege on the discretion of the future government; yet in a political light they are not acting wisely; in the state of Pennsylvania, they form so considerable a portion of the community, as must ensure them great weight in the government; but in the scale of general empire, they will be lost in the ballance.15 I intended in this number to have shewn from the nature of things, from the opinions of the greatest writers and from the peculiar circumstances of the United States, the impracticability of establishing and maintaining one government on the principles of freedom in so extensive a territory; to have shewn, if practicable, the inadequacy of such government, to provide for its many and various concerns; and also to have shewn that a confederation of small republics, possessing all the powers of internal government, and united in the management of their general and foreign concerns, is the only system of government, by which so extensive a country can be governed consistent with freedom: but a writer under the signature of Brutus, in the New-York paper, which has been re-published by Messrs. Dunlap and Claypoole, has done this in so masterly a manner, that it would be superfluous in me to add any thing on this subject.16 My fellow citizens, as a lover of my country, as the friend to mankind, whilst it is yet safe to write, and whilst it is yet in your power to avoid it, I warn you of the impending danger. To this remote quarter of the world, has liberty fled�Other countries now subject to slavery, were once as free as we yet are; therefore for your own sakes, for the sake of your posterity, as well as for that of the oppressed of all nations, cherish this remaining asylum of liberty. Philadelphia, November 5th, 1787."
Newspaper,No,An Officer of the Late Continental Army,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/6/1787,"Friends, Countrymen, Brethren, and Fellow Citizens: The important day is drawing near when you are to elect delegates to represent you in a convention, on the result of whose deliberations will depend, in a great measure, your future happiness. This convention is to determine whether or not the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall adopt the plan of government proposed by the late Convention of delegates from the different states, which sat in this city. With a heart full of anxiety for the preservation of your dearest rights, I presume to address you on this important occasion. In the name of sacred liberty, dearer to us than our property and our lives, I request your most earnest attention. The proposed plan of continental government is now fully known to you. You have read it, I trust, with the attention it deserves. You have heard the objections that have been made to it. You have heard the answers to these objections. If you have attended to the whole with candor and unbiased minds, as becomes men that are possessed and deserving of freedom, you must have been alarmed at the result of your observations. Notwithstanding the splendor of names which has attended the publication of the new Constitution, notwithstanding the sophistry and vain reasoning that have been urged to support its principles; alas! you must at least have concluded that great men are not always infallible, and that patriotism itself may be led into essential errors. The objections that have been made to the new Constitution are these: 1. It is not merely (as it ought to be) a CONFEDERATION of STATES, but a GOVERNMENT of INDIVIDUALS. . The powers of Congress extend to the lives, the liberties and the property of every citizen. 3. The sovereignty of the different states is ipso facto destroyed in its most essential parts. 4. What remains of it will only tend to create violent dissensions between the state governments and the Congress, and terminate in the ruin of the one or the other. 5. The consequence must therefore be, either that the Union of the states will be destroyed by a violent struggle or that their sovereignty will be swallowed up by silent encroachments into a universal aristocracy; because it is clear, that if two different sovereign powers have a coequal command over the purses of the citizens, they will struggle for the spoils, and the weakest will be in the end obliged to yield to the efforts of the strongest. 6. Congress being possessed of these immense powers, the liberties of the states and of the people are not secured by a bill or DECLARATION of RIGHTS. 7. The sovereignty of the states is not expressly reserved, the form only, and not the SUBSTANCE of their government, is guaranteed to them by express words. 8. TRIAL BY JURY, that sacred bulwark of liberty, is ABOLISHED IN CIVIL CASES, and Mr. [James] W[ilson], one of the Convention, has told you, that not being able to agree as to the FORM of establishing this point, they have left you deprived of the SUBSTANCE. Here are his own words: �The subject was involved in difficulties. The Convention found the task TOO DIFFICULT for them, and left the business as it stands.�2 9. THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS is not secured, and the powers of Congress are fully adequate to its destruction, as they are to have the trial of libels, or pretended libels against the United States, and may by a cursed abominable STAMP ACT (as the Bowdoin administration has done in Massachusetts) preclude you effectually from all means of information.3 Mr. W[ilson] has given you no answer to these arguments. 10. Congress have the power of keeping up a STANDING ARMY in time of peace, and Mr. W[ilson] has told you THAT IT WAS NECESSARY. 11. The LEGISLATIVE and EXECUTIVE powers are not kept separate as every one of the American constitutions declares they ought to be; but they are mixed in a manner entirely novel and unknown, even to the constitution of Great Britain; because, 12. In England the king only has a nominal negative over the proceedings of the legislature, which he has NEVER DARED TO [212page icon]EXERCISE since the days of King William, whereas by the new Constitution, both the President General and the Senate, TWO EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, have that negative and are intended to support each other in the exercise of it. 13. The representation of the lower house is too small, consisting only of 65 members. 14. That of the Senate is so small that it renders its extensive powers extremely dangerous. It is to consist only of 26 members, two-thirds of whom must concur to conclude any treaty or alliance with foreign powers. Now we will suppose that five of them are absent, sick, dead, or unable to attend; twenty-one will remain, and eight of these (one-third, and one over) may prevent the conclusion of any treaty, even the most favorable to America. Here will be a fine field for the intrigues and even the bribery and corruption of European powers. 15. The most important branches of the EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT are to be put into the hands of a single magistrate, who will be in fact an ELECTIVE KING. The MILITARY, the land and naval forces are to be entirely at his disposal, and therefore: 16. Should the Senate, by the intrigues of foreign powers, become devoted to foreign influence, as was the case of late in Sweden, the people will be obliged, as the Swedes have been, to seek their refuge in the arms of the monarch or PRESIDENT GENERAL. 17. ROTATION, that noble prerogative of liberty, is entirely excluded from the new system of government, and great men may and probably will be continued in office during their lives. 18. ANNUAL ELECTIONS are abolished, and the people are not to reassume their rights until the expiration of two, four and six years. 19. Congress are to have the power of fixing the time, place and manner of holding elections, so as to keep them forever subjected to their influence. 20. The importation of slaves is not to be prohibited until the year 1808, and SLAVERY will probably resume its empire in Pennsylvania. 21. The MILITIA is to be under the immediate command of Congress, and men conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms may be compelled to perform military duty. 22. The new government will be EXPENSIVE beyond any we have ever experienced, the judicial department alone, with its concomitant train of judges, justices, chancellors, clerks, sheriffs, coroners, escheators, state attornies and solicitors, constables, etc. in every state and in every county in each state, will be a burden beyond the utmost abilities of the people to bear, and upon the whole. 23. A government partaking of MONARCHY and aristocracy will be fully and firmly established, and liberty will be but a name to adorn the short historic page of the halcyon days of America. These, my countrymen, are the objections that have been made to the new proposed system of government; and if you read the system itself with attention, you will find them all to be founded in truth. But what have you been told in answer? I pass over the sophistry of Mr. W[ilson], in his equivocal speech at the State House. His pretended arguments have been echoed and reechoed by every retailer of politics, and victoriously refuted by several patriotic pens. Indeed if you read this famous speech in a cool dispassionate moment, you will find it to contain no more than a train of pitiful sophistry and evasions, unworthy of the man who spoke them. I have taken notice of some of them in stating the objections, and they must, I am sure, have excited your pity and indignation. Mr. W[ilson] is a man of sense, learning and extensive information; unfortunately for him he has never sought the more solid fame of patriotism. During the late war he narrowly escaped the effects of popular rage, and the people seldom arm themselves against a citizen in vain. The whole tenor of his political conduct has always been strongly tainted with the spirit of high aristocracy; he has never been known to join in a truly popular measure, and his talents have ever been devoted to the patrician interest. His lofty carriage indicates the lofty mind that animates him, a mind able to conceive and perform great things, but which unfortunately can see nothing great out of the pale of power and worldly grandeur; despising what he calls the inferior order of the people. Popular liberty and popular assemblies offer to his exalted imagination an idea of meanness and contemptibility which he hardly seeks to conceal. He sees at a distance the pomp and pageantry of courts, he sighs after those stately palaces and that apparatus of human greatness which his vivid fancy has taught him to consider as the supreme good. Men of sublime minds, he conceives, were born a different race from the rest of the sons of men. To them, and them only, he imagines, high heaven intended to commit the reins of earthly government; the remaining part of mankind he sees below at an immense distance; they, he thinks, were born to serve, to administer food to the ambition of their superiors, and become the footstool of their power. Such is Mr. W[ilson], and fraught with these high ideas, it is no wonder that he should exert all his talents to support a form of government so admirably contrived to carry them into execution. But when the people, who possess collectively a mass of knowledge superior to his own, inquire into the principles of that government on the establishment or rejection of which depend their dearest concerns, when he is called upon by the voice of thousands to come and explain that favorite system which he holds forth as an object of their admiration, he comes�he attempts to support by reasoning what reason never dictated, and finding the attempt vain, his great mind, made for nobler purposes, is obliged to stoop to mean evasions and pitiful sophistry. Himself not deceived, he strives to deceive the people, and the treasonable attempt delineates his true character, beyond the reach of the pencil of a West or Peale, or the pen of a Valerius. And yet that speech, weak and insidious as it is, is the only attempt that has been made to support by argument that political monster THE PROPOSED CONSTITUTION. I have sought in vain amidst the immense heap of trash that has been published on the subject, an argument worthy of refutation, and I have not been able to find it. If you can bear the disgust which the reading of those pieces must naturally occasion, and which I have felt in the highest degree, read them, my fellow citizens, and say whether they contain the least shadow of logical reasoning. Say (laying your hands upon your hearts) whether there is anything in them that can impress unfeigned conviction upon your unprejudiced minds. One of them only I shall take notice of, in which I find that argument is weakly attempted. This piece is signed �An American Citizen� and has appeared with great pomp in four succeeding numbers in several of our newspapers.4 But if you read it attentively, you will find that it does not tell us what the new Constitution IS, but what it IS NOT, and extols it on the sole ground that it does not contain ALL the principles of tyranny with which the European governments are disgraced. But where argument entirely failed, nothing remained for the supporters of the new Constitution but to endeavor to inflame your passions. The attempt has been made and I am sorry to find not entirely without effect. The great names of WASHINGTON and FRANKLIN have been taken in vain and shockingly prostituted to effect the most infamous purposes. What! because our august chieftain has subscribed his name in his capacity of President of the Convention to the plan offered by them to the states, and because the venerable sage of Pennsylvania has testified by his signature that the majority of the delegates of this state assented to the same plan, will anyone infer from this that it has met with their entire approbation, and that they consider it as the masterpiece of human wisdom? I am apt to think the contrary, and I have good reasons to ground my opinion on. n the first place we have found by the publication of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Esquire, one of the signing members of the Convention, who has expressed the most pointed disapprobation of many important parts of the new plan of government, that all the members whose names appear at the bottom of this instrument of tyranny have not concurred in its adoption.5 Many of them might conceive themselves bound by the opinion of the majority of their state, and leaving the people to their own judgment upon the form of government offered to them, might have conceived it impolitic by refusing to sign their names, to offer to the world the lamentable spectacle of the disunion of a body on the decisions of whom the people had rested all their hopes. We KNOW, and the long sitting of the Convention tells us, that (as it is endeavored to persuade us) concord and unanimity did not reign exclusively among them. The thick veil of secrecy with which their proceedings have been covered has left us entirely in the dark, as to the debates that took place, and the unaccountable SUPPRESSION OF THEIR JOURNALS, the highest insult that could be offered to the majesty of the people, shows clearly that the whole of the new plan was entirely the work of an aristocratic majority. But let us suppose for a moment that the proposed government was the unanimous result of the deliberations of the Convention-must it on that account preclude an investigation of its merits? Are the people to be dictated to without appeal by any set of men, however great, however dignified? Freedom spurns at the idea and rejects it with disdain. We appeal to the collective wisdom of a great nation, we appeal to their general sense which is easily to be obtained through the channel of a multitude of free presses, from the opinions of thirty-nine men, who secluded from the rest of the world, without the possibility of conferring with the rest of their fellow citizens, have had no opportunity of rectifying the errors into which they may have been led by the most designing among them. We have seen names not less illustrious than those of the members of the late Convention subscribed to the present reprobated Articles of Confederation, and if those patriots have erred, there is no reason to suppose that a succeeding set should be more free from error. Nay the very men, who advocate so strongly the new plan of government, and support it with the infallibility of Doctor Franklin, affect to despise the present constitution of Pennsylvania, which was dictated and avowed by that venerable patriot. They are conscious that he does not entirely approve of the new plan, whose principles are so different from those he has established in our ever-glorious constitution, and there is no doubt that it is the reason that has [216page icon]induced them to leave his respected name out of the ticket for the approaching election. Now then my fellow citizens, my brethren, my friends; if the sacred flame of liberty be not extinguished in your breasts, if you have any regard for the happiness of yourselves, and your posterity, let me entreat you, earnestly entreat you by all that is dear and sacred to freemen, to consider well before you take an awful step which may involve in its consequences the ruin of millions yet unborn. You are on the brink of a dreadful precipice; in the name therefore of holy liberty, for which I have fought and for which we have all suffered, I call upon you to make a solemn pause before you proceed. One step more, and perhaps the scene of freedom is closed forever in America. Let not a set of aspiring despots, who make us SLAVES and tell us tis our CHARTER, wrest from you those invaluable blessings, for which the most illustrious sons of America have bled and died; but exert yourselves, like men, like freemen and like Americans, to transmit unimpaired to your latest posterity those rights, those liberties, which have ever been so dear to you, and which it is yet in your power to preserve." 
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,11/7/1787,"When the advocates of a cause use their endeavors to stop a free and thorough investigation of the subject, we as naturally and as justly infer that the cause is a bad one, as that two and two make four. A good cause, like pure gold, may be tried in the fire and yet retain its full weight and value, or like the utensils of husbandry grow brighter and fitter for use the more it is handled. The application of this observation in respect to the friends of the new Constitution is easy. They see that the more this new scheme of government is discussed, the more tyrannical and ill-adapted to the present circumstances of America does it appear. We find, say they, that to reason in favor of the Constitution is only to give its enemies more latitude to condemn; for although we could call in to our aid a sufficient stock of sophistical arguments and circumstances, by which we might dispose the incautious part of the people to join us in establishing this government, yet we have already experienced that by such means we defeat ourselves; as we thereby give a greater scope for those of more penetration to write against the Constitution. The advocates of this government have also tried an expedient which has been known to succeed upon some occasions, namely, to answer�reason�and�argument�with scurrility and personal invective; but even here they have failed, for the magnitude of the object is so great, as to reduce every little circumstance of that kind to a mere point. In little matters this sort of procedure might do well enough, but in an affair of such vast importance to the whole continent of America its operation is nugatory. In this desperate situation of affairs, it need not to be wondered at, that the friends of this despotic scheme of government were driven to the last and the only alternative from which there was any probability of success; namely, the abolition of the�freedom of the press. And accordingly we find, in the�Independent Gazetteer�of the 29th of October, a writer who signs himself A Pennsylvania Mechanic says,2��It appears, by a late eastern paper, that the publisher of the�Massachusetts Gazette�is determined to publish no sentiments on this important subject (viz the new Constitution), unless the writers leave their names with the printer, that anyone that may be desirous of knowing the author, may be informed. No honest man, no true friend to America or to the liberty or happiness of mankind can object to this. For your imitation, gentlemen, I humbly propose the conduct of this your worthy brother, the publisher of the�Massachusetts Gazette.�3�This Pennsylvania Mechanic one would take to be a blacksmith, whose true employment is to construct chains to confine to perpetual slavery the freemen of America; but, be that as it may, we find that he can soon call in more of his fellow craftsmen to his assistance, who even seem to be more expert at their occupation than our mechanic abovementioned. One of these tradesmen has given us a small portion of his skill in the business of chainmaking in the�Independent Gazetteer�of the 31st of October, under the signature of Galba,4�which small scrap of his workmanship I beg leave to transcribe that we may be the better able to judge of its excellency. He says, �Mr. Oswald, The hint in your paper of last Monday, that everyone ought to leave his name with the printer who writes for or against the new form of government proposed by the honorable Convention, is only in my opinion right in part; for what reason is there that the patriotic gentlemen who write in favor of a scheme of government that holds forth peace, happiness and prosperity to our distressed country, should, by leaving their names with the printers, be exposed to the malevolence of those wretches who pretend to find fault with it. Indeed, I think it perfectly right that those who wantonly write against it should leave their names, that they may be justly exposed to the contempt and indignation of their fellow citizens, as enemies and traitors to their country; and I hope every patriotic printer in the Union will for the future pay proper attention to the justness and absolute propriety of this hint.� Stop and pause a little,�Galba. I really believe you were not in your right senses when you wrote this, your hint; for if you had been studying for seven years how you might effectually injure the new Constitution, you could not have hit on a thought more to your purpose. Your zeal has transported you so far beyond the bounds of propriety and discretion, that the haughtiest lordling and friend to arbitrary government in America must hang down his head and blush upon reading your ill-timed hint. I assure you, sir, I think you have explained yourself right cleverly; you have given us a specimen of the genius and spirit of our new government. Here we see pretty plainly through your excellent regulation of the press, how things are to be carried on after the adoption of the new Constitution. All the writings must be on ONE SIDE. The new Constitution appears so glorious and immaculate to�Galba, that all those who have sufficient spirit to avow their sentiments on the occasion are to be called traitors and enemies to their country, if they do not just think as he does. And to render them still more odious and execrable, he would have the printers throughout the Union to publish their names with their pieces should any of them have the imprudence to write on the subject. I wonder that�Galba�did not propose a suit of tar and feathers; but as the tailors have of late become a little bashful about trying on this sort of apparel, and the conceit is therefore a little stale, he would have those obnoxious writers to leave their names with the printers, that they may be clothed by their fellow citizens with�indignation and contempt, as with a garment; whilst he would have the patriotic writers in favor of the Constitution entirely exempted from such an abstracted kind of a�coat�and�jacket. We thank you,�Galba, for your kind and very liberal hint; for it certainly merits our attention. I make no doubt but it is the wish of a thousand of our wellborn as well as of yourself, that the printers would comply with your request. Such a thought is natural enough; it must naturally be the wish of every�little petty tyrant�in the United States. But most of the printers in Philadelphia are men of sentiment, they are lovers of liberty and the rights of mankind and will necessarily despise such hints, and treat them with the contempt they deserve. There is such a degree of meanness in the requisition, especially in that of�Galba-Longhead, as must insult the understanding and integrity of every independent printer who sees it. Galba, your hint was rather calculated for the meridian of Boston than that of Philadelphia, and I doubt not but you and the Boston printers have one and the same object�self is an old fellow. This trite saying, I think, will apply. In Boston the liberty of the press is now completely abolished; and hence all other privileges and rights of the people will in a short time be destroyed. No wonder then, that the printers in Boston would exert themselves in favor of this new government. Their present condition is a drawing in miniature of that in which the adoption of the new Constitution will certainly place the whole Union; so that after the nature of the prince of darkness, they wish to have all their fellow citizens in the same dreadful situation with themselves. [Benjamin] Russell, the printer of the�Massachusetts Centinel, has the effrontery to insult the freemen of America so far as to say in his paper of October the 10th �That, aiming thereby to be just, he is determined not to give place to any piece against the new Constitution, except the writer leave his name to be made public if desired.�5�Russell, I would not hire a mob to bear you aloft as an object of hatred and contempt, nor would I bribe them to hang you in effigy, although you really deserve it. I am sensible of the danger of inflaming the multitude in a free government, for when a public tumult has once been raised, justice has often been sacrificed to appease it; so that I do not intend to raise a fatal prejudice against you. My intention is to consider the nature and consequences of your conduct as an advocate for the new Constitution, which, as far as it respects the liberty of the press, has done more prejudice to your cause than its enemies can do by the violence of their accusations, however well they may be founded. On so momentous a subject as the new Constitution, it is as plain as any axiom in geometry, that it is of no importance whether or not a writer gives his name; it is with the illustrations and arguments�he affords us, and not with his name, we have any concern. Besides, this practice would tend to draw off the mind of the writer from the calm investigation of the subject, to recriminations and personal invectives. And, moreover, men of ability, and of a modest, timid or diffident cast of mind would be deterred altogether from publishing their sentiments. Of what use could it be to the public to know the name of the writer of the piece signed Lucius, that Russell refused to publish? Certainly of no use at all.�Non quis sed quid. It was not with the author of Lucius that the freemen of Massachusetts had anything to do, but with his reasoning; which, if it were just, ought not to be suppressed, and if it were fallacious should be refuted. Let candor and impartiality be the characteristics of our printers, in respect to this new government, which involves in its consequences the happiness or misery of millions yet unborn. This is the line of conduct which men of honor and integrity will naturally pursue, and I find an unspeakable satisfaction when I every day behold the printers of Philadelphia following this plan almost to a man. And hence I am led to conclude, that the�Pennsylvania Mechanic�and his successor�Galba�must find their hints to be a little premature; such doctrine might have suited finely about the time of the mock ringing of the bells in this city, for joy and gladness, that Congress had recommended the adoption of this new plan of government to the different states (which, by the by, they unluckily forgot to recommend to this present hour). The gentlemen who are friends to the new Constitution had better not blab so freely, especially in regard to the freedom of the press; they ought to wait until this government of governments is once established, and then instead of a coat and jacket of�contempt�and�indignation�they may speak boldly about a gallows, a gibbet, or at least a dungeon, for such writers as the�Old Whig�or�Centinel, who have dared to speak like freemen. I wonder that our�wellborn�should allow such mean fellows to write against this their government�such base wretches ought not to live in the same country with�gentlemen;�and as soon as our new government is confirmed, these vile enemies to its�splendor�and�dignity�shall quit their capering, I�ll warrant them; a federal soldier with a fixed bayonet will soon give such daring dogs their quietus. Ah! what glorious days are coming; how I anticipate the brilliancy of the American court! Behold that gilded chariot set with diamonds and drawn by eight Arabian horses. Off with your hats you poltroons, here is the President going in state to the senate-house to confirm the law for the�abolition of the liberty of the press. Men and brethren will not these things be so? Yes, most assuredly, if we adopt the new Constitution in its present form. These things will be so. Rouse then, rouse my fellow�citizens, and show yourselves to be freemen. This is the most important object that ever presented itself to your understanding. The independence of America, which God himself vouchsafed through his infinite mercy to confer upon us, must end in a curse, if this tyrannical government be suffered to be established. But forbid it heaven! I was told, last Saturday evening [3 November], by a gentleman of veracity whom I met at the meeting at the State House, that several persons had waited that day on Mrs. [Eleazer] Oswald,(a)�for the purpose of requesting her not to publish any pieces against the new Constitution, at the same time intimating that if she persisted, she would forfeit their interests; and that in consequence of her spirited reply, several had that very day withdrawn their subscriptions for the paper.6�This is truly an alarming circumstance. Where is the freeman in America that this is not sufficient to rouse from a state of supineness? My brethren, be circumspect on this momentous occasion, �And, take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness. And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.��Amen."

I imagine the truth is he is looking out for some lucrative place under the new Constitution, despairing of success at the bar.2�You would be surprised to see what violent hatred is conceived by all the Federalists against everyone who dares to speak a word against the new Constitution; tis as great as the Tories ever had against the Whigs. They would hang them all and yet all the arguments they have in its favor are comprehended in these 3: that great and good men were 4 months framing it, that anarchy and distress will follow its rejection, and that we never can hope to see so good a one if this is not received�and they add if it is found not to be a good one it can be altered. In one of the pieces I send these are well answered, yet the people in general are satisfied and frightened and will adopt it.

Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,11/21/1787,"A correspondent says, that the abuse which has been lately thrown upon the State of Rhode-Island, seems to be greatly unmerited. Popular favour is variable, and those who are now despised and insulted may soon change situations with the present idols of the people. Rhode-Island has outdone even the State of Pennsylvania in the glorious work of freeing the negroes in this country, without which the patriotism of some States appears ridiculous- The General Assembly of the state of Rhode-Island has prevented the farther importation of negroes, and have made a law, by which all the blacks born in the State after March, 1784, are absolutely and at once free.1 They have fully complied with the recommendations of Congress in regard to the late treaty of peace with Great Britain, and have passed an act declaring it to be the law of the land. They have never refused their quota of taxes demanded by Congress, excepting the five per cent. impost, which they considered as a dangerous tax; and for which, at present, there is perhaps no great necessity, as the western territory, of which a part has very lately been sold at a considerable price, may soon produce an immense revenue; and, in the interim, the Congress may raise in the old manner the taxes which shall be found necessary for the support of the government. The State of Rhode Island refused to send delegates to the State Convention, and the event has manifested that their refusal was a happy one, as the New Constitution, which the Convention has proposed to us, is an elective monarchy, which is proverbially the worst government. This new government would have been supported at a vast expence, by which our taxes, the right of which is solely vested in Congress, (a circumstance which manifests that the various states of the Union will be mere corporations) would be doubled or trebled; the liberty of the press is not stipulated for, and therefore may be invaded at pleasure;2 the supreme continental court is to have, almost in every case, ""appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact,"" which signifies, if there is any meaning in words, the setting aside the trial by jury;3 Congress will have the power of guaranteeing to every State a right to import negroes for twenty-one years, by which some of the States who have now declined that iniquitous traffic, may re-enter into it-for the private laws of every state are to submit to the superior jurisdiction of Congress;4 a standing army is to be kept on foot, by which the vicious, the sycophantic, and the time serving will be exalted, and the brave, the patriotic, and the virtuous will be deprest.5 Our correspondent, therefore, thinks it the part of wisdom to abide, like the state of Rhode-Island, by the old articles of confederation, which, if reexamined with attention, we shall find worthy of great regard; that we should give high praise to the manly and public spirited sixteen members, who lately seceded from our House of Assembly; and that we should all impress with great care this truth upon our minds, That it is very easy to change a free government into an arbitrary one, but that it is very difficult to convert tyranny into freedom."

Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/24/1787,"Mr. printer, I think it is an observation of Dean Swift, that, in political matters, all men can feel, though all cannot see. Agreeably to this doctrine we find, that the necessity of giving additional powers to Congress is at length felt by all men, though it was not foreseen by a great number of the people. As the states individually could not protect our trade, foreign nations, friends as well as enemies, have combined against it; and at the same time that our trade is more beneficial to any nation in Europe, than the trade of any nation in Europe is to us, because we export provisions and raw materials and receive manufactures in return: we are not suffered to be the carriers of our own produce�foreign bottoms engross the whole of our carrying trade, and we are obliged to pay them for doing that which it is the interest of every people to do for themselves. Our shipwrights are starved, our seamen driven abroad for want of employ, our timber left useless on our hands, our ironworks, once a very profitable branch of business, now almost reduced to nothing, and our money banished from the country. These with the train of concomitant evils which always attend the loss of trade, or a state of trade which is unprofitable, have justly alarmed us all; and I am firmly pursuaded that scarcely a man of common sense can be found, that does not wish for an efficient federal government, and lament that it has been delayed so long. Yet at the same time it is a matter [216]of immense consequence, in establishing a government which is to last for ages, and which, if it be suffered to depart from the principles of liberty in the beginning, will in all probability, never return to them, that we consider carefully what sort of government we are about to form. Power is very easily encreased; indeed it naturally grows in every government; but it hardly ever lessens. The misfortunes under which we have for some time laboured, and which still press us severely, would be in a great measure alleviated, if not wholly removed, by devolving upon Congress the power of regulating trade and laying and collecting duties and imposts. If these powers were once fully vested in Congress, trade would immediately assume a new face, money and people would flow in upon us, and the vast tracts of ungranted lands would be a mine of wealth for many years to come. I am pursuaded, that with this addition to the powers of Congress, we should soon find them sufficient for every purpose; and it is very certain that if we did not find them sufficient, we could easily encrease them. But instead of being contented with this, the late convention by their proposed constitution, seem to have resolved to give the new continental government every kind of power whatsoever, throughout the United States. This power I have already attempted to show, is not limited by any stipulations in favour of the liberty of the subject, and it is easy to shew, that it will be equally unchecked by any restraint from the individual states. The treasure of the whole continent will be entirely at their command. �The Congress shall have power to levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.� And what are the individual states to do, or how are they to subsist? may they also lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises? If they should, the miserable subject will be like sheep twice shorne; the skin must follow the fleece. But the fact is, that no individual state can collect a penny, unless by the permission of Congress; for the �laws of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary, notwithstanding.� The laws of the individual states, will be only Leges sub graviore Lege: for the power of enacting laws necessarily implies the power of repealing laws; and therefore Congress, being the supreme legislatures, may annul or repeal the laws of the individual states, whenever they please. Not a single source of revenue will remain to any state, which Congress may not stop at their sovereign will and pleasure; for if any state attempt to impose a tax or levy a duty, contrary to the inclination of Congress, they have only to exert their supreme legislative power and the law imposing such tax or duty, is done away in a moment. For instance, it will very soon be found inconvenient to have two sets of excise officers in each town or county in every state, they will [217]be in danger of clashing with each other, it will then be found �necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers vested by the constitution in the government of the United States, or in some department or officer thereof,� to forbid the individual states to levy any more excise. Congress may chuse to impose a stamp-duty. It will be very inconvenient for people to run back and forward to different offices, to procure double stamps, and therefore it will be thought �necessary and proper� to forbid any state to meddle with stamp-duties. The same will be the case with many other taxes. They will be in danger of clashing with each other, if Congress and the several states should happen to lay taxes on the same article. The States therefore individually, will be restrained from imposing any taxes upon such articles as Congress shall think proper to tax. They must then try to find out other articles for taxation, which Congress have not thought proper to touch. This I fear will be a difficult task: for the expensive court to be maintained by the great president, the pay of the standing army and the numerous crouds of hungry expectants, who have lost their all, and it will be said, have lost it by their zeal for the new constitution, must necessarily employ the sharpest wits among their ablest financiers, to devise every possible mode of taxation; and besides, if an individual state should hit upon a new tax that should happen to be productive, there is no doubt but it would soon be taken from it and appropriated to the use of the United States. The inhabitants of the ten mile square, would find ways and means to dispose of all the money that could possibly be raised in every part of the United States. What then will become of the separate governments? They will be annihilated; absolutely annihilated; for no man will ever submit to the wretchedness and contempt of holding any office under them. The advocates of the proposed constitution, seem to be aware of the difficulty I have hinted at, and therefore it is, I presume, that in conversation as well as in their publications, we are told that under the proposed constitution, �direct taxation will be unnecessary;� that �it is probable the principal branch of revenue will be duties on imports.�2 Some of those who have used such language in public and private, I believe to be very honest men; and I would therefore ask of them, what security they can give us, that the future government of the continent will in any measure confine themselves to the duties upon imports, or that the utmost penny will not be exacted which can possibly be collected either by direct or indirect taxation? How can they answer for the conduct of our future rulers? We have heard enough of these fair promises for the good behaviour of men in office, to learn to doubt of their fulfilment, unless we guard ourselves by much better security, there will [218]be no bounds to the new government. They will not have as much to spare for the separate states to collect as Lazarus picked up of the fragments from the rich man�s table.3 There are mouths at this moment gaping in the United States for all that can possibly be collected;�a confederacy is already formed for dividing the public cake to the last crum; and I wish they may not quarrel for more. But if I were mistaken in this opinion; if in the language of these gentlemen, �it is probable that the principal branch of the public revenue will be duties on imports;��if it is probable that these with the back lands and the post-office will be sufficient, where was the necessity of being in such haste to grant more;�to grant all without limits or restrictions? Men do not usually give up their whole purse where they can pay with part. Why might we not try at least how far the customs and back lands would go before we give all away from the seperate states, without reserving any thing for their support. The true line of distinction which should have been drawn in describing the powers of Congress, and those of the several states, should have been that between internal and external taxation. I am persuaded that the existence of the several states in their separate capacities, and of the United States in their collective capacity, depends upon the maintaining such distinction. Without the power of imposing duties on foreign commerce and regulating trade, the United States will be weak and contemptible, and, indeed, their union must be speedily dissolved: And on the other hand, if the Legislature of the United States shall possess the powers of internal as well as external taxation, the individual states in their separate capacities, will be less than the shadows of a name. I observe that the late delegates of Connecticut, in their letter to the Governor, speak of the power of direct taxation as an authority which need not be exercised if each state will �furnish the quota.�4 Yet there is no doubt but they may exercise this power if they choose to do it; and they alone will have the right of judging what quotas the several states shall be required to furnish. They may ask as much as they please, and if the states do not furnish all they ask, they may tax at their pleasure; under these circumstances the power of internal taxation will undoubtedly be exercised by the Continental Legislature. If it be said that it is to be expected that the Congress will exercise this power with moderation, I venture to pronounce that those who indulge such hopes, are not acquainted with the principles of human nature. Independent of the multitudinous expectations which the followers of the proposed Constitution entertain in their own favor, which alone, if gratified, would consume the treasures of two such continents as this; there is a spirit of rivalship in power, which will not suffer two suns to shine in the same [219]firmament, one will speedily darken the other, and the individual states will be as totally eclipsed, as the stars in the meridian blaze of the sun. We have seen too much of this spirit in the several states, under the present loose and futile confederation. A jealousy of the powers of Congress in the separate states, which is founded in the same rivalship of power, and which, however contemptible it may appear, was alike founded in the principles of human nature, may furnish us an exemplary lesson upon this head: And when we verge to the other extreme by vesting all power in Congress, we shall find them equally jealous of any power in the individual states, and equally possessed of the same spirit of rivalship, which heretofore denied the necessary supplies from the states to Congress.�We shall never be able to support the collective powers of the United States in Congress, and the powers of the individual states in their separate capacities, without drawing the line fairly between them. If we leave the states individually to the mercy of the Continental Government, they will be stript of the last penny which is necessary for their support: if we give all powers to one, there will be nothing left for the others. The lust of dominion, where it is indulged, will swallow up the whole. But I shall be told that if Congress are left to depend upon requisitions from the individual states for any part of the necessary supplies, the same difficulty will remain which has hitherto existed; and I may be asked, what shall we do if the supplies should fall short? I answer that although nothing but a very serious necessity of money for continental purposes will ever procure supplies upon requisition from the separate states, yet when that necessity exists in any degree that is really alarming to the whole community, I do not think that such supplies are to be dispaired of. We have seen many instances of aid being furnished, even voluntarily upon pressing occasions, which should teach us to rely on the exertions of the states upon occasions of real and not mere imaginary necessity. One thing will certainly follow from the Continental Governments being restrained to external taxation;�that it will be under the necessity of exercising more �conomy than it has done, especially during the late war. We have been witnesses of such a profuse expenditure of public money at some periods, as these states could never support. This profusion ought to convince us that if all the treasures of the continent are intrusted to the power of Congress, there is too much reason to fear that the whole will be consumed by them, and nothing left to the individual states; and judging from past experience we may venture to presage that the people will be fleeced without mercy, if no check is maintained upon the power of Congress in the articles of taxation. We ought to be very fully convinced of an absolute necessity existing before we entrust the whole power of taxation to the hands of Congress; and the moment we do so, we ought by consent to annihilate the individual states; for the powers of the individual states will be as effectually swallowed as a drop of water in the ocean; and the next consequence will be a speedy dissolution of our republican form of government."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,11/28/1787,"My Fellow-Citizens, The present time will probably form a new epoch in the annals of America. This important, this awful crisis bids fair to be the theme of our posterity for many generations. We are now publicly summoned to determine whether we and our children are to be freemen or slaves; whether the liberty, which we have so recently purchased with the blood of thousands of our fellow countrymen, is to terminate in a blessing or a curse. The establishment of a new government is a matter of such immense magnitude, that any other human transaction is small indeed when [252]compared to it. Great circumspection is therefore necessary on this interesting occasion: the temporal, and in some measure the eternal happiness of millions of souls is involved in this important work: I say even in some measure our eternal happiness is concerned; for, that a good or a bad government naturally influences religion and morality, is a principle indisputably confirmed by fact. Under a free and patriotic government, the bulk of the people will necessarily be virtuous: but under a tyrannical and unjust one, the greater part of the people will as necessarily be wicked: the complexion of the governing is ever the colour of the governed. Every freeman possessed of the smallest portion of patriotism and general philanthropy, ought, at this critical juncture, to think seriously, to deliberate coolly, and to determine cautiously. All that is dear to him, nay all that constitutes life itself happy or miserable, is at this very moment about to be unalterably fixed: the rivet of tyranny may now be clenched, that will bind forever the freedom of America in the indissoluble chains of cursed slavery. In the adoption of the new constitution in its present form, we will lose more than all that we have fought for, and gained in a glorious and successful war of seven years; yea, and still more than this, our very character of citizens and freemen will be changed to that of subjects and slaves. In this act the bright orb of glorious liberty will go down under the horizon of cruel oppression, never never to illuminate our western hemisphere again! How much better, that she had never cast a ray upon Columbia, than thus to blaze for a moment, and then to vanish forever! In regard to religious liberty, the cruelty of the new government will probably be felt sooner in Pennsylvania than in any state in the union. The number of religious denominations in this state, who are principled against fighting or bearing arms, will be greatly distressed indeed. In the new constitution there is no declaration in their favour; but on the contrary, the Congress and President are to have an absolute power over the standing army, navy, and militia; and the president, or rather emperor, is to be commander in chief. Now, I think, that it will appear plain, that no exemption whatever from militia duty, shall be allowed to any set of men, however conscientiously scrupulous they may be against bearing arms. Indeed, from the nature and qualifications of the president, we may justly infer, that such an idea is altogether preposterous: he is by profession a military man, and possibly an old soldier; now, such a man, from his natural temper, necessarily despises those who have a conscientious aversion to a military profession, which is probably the very thing in which he principally piques himself. Only men of his own kind [253]will be esteemed by him; his fellow soldier he will conceive to be his true friend, and the only character worthy of his notice and confidence. Since, in the new constitution no provision is made for securing to these peaceable citizens their religious liberties, it follows then by implication, that no such provision was intended. Their influence in the state of Pennsylvania is fully sufficient to save them from suffering very materially on this account; but in the great vortex of the whole continent, it can have no weight. How can we expect that a special law will be made by the new Congress merely on their account; and yet it will be absolutely necessary that such a law shall be made, before this privilege is secured to them? Can any man rationally suppose that the president will give his assent to a law in favor of the men whom he heartily despises; a law also, that in its operation must curtail his own dignity and splender, by reducing the number of his military? No certainly. There is not probably a military man on earth that could bear the thought. So that such a supposition is absurd. The friends of this scheme of government may possibly attempt to say, that this religious liberty is sufficiently secured by the constitution of the state. But I say not; for, this is a case in which the United States are a party, and every case of this kind, according to the new plan, must be determined by the supreme law of the land; that is, by the Congress and president, who are to have the sole direction of the militia. This will be a matter then, in which a particular state can have no concern. From the proceedings of the convention, respecting liberty of conscience, foreign politicians might be led to draw a strange conclusion, viz. that the majority of that assembly were either men of no religion, or all of one religion; such a conclusion naturally follows their silence on that subject; they must either have been indifferent about religion, or determined to compel the whole continent to conform to their own. For my own part, I really think, that their conduct in this instance is inexplicable: it is impossible to divine what might have been their intentions. ?To illustrate this defect in the new constitution, by a familiar instance: we shall suppose that the negroes of Georgia, or some of the southern states, prompted by the love of sacred liberty, shall attempt to free themselves from cruel slavery, by a noble appeal to arms. In this case the Congress may order the militia of Pennsylvania to march off to quell this insurrection: now on such an occasion, what must the condition of that Pennsylvanian be, who, besides being conscientiously scrupulous against bearing arms, on any account whatever, has, over and above, made the manumission of slavery, a part of his religious creed? Miserable must be the state of such a man�s mind indeed! More to be pitied is he, than the wretches against whom he is compelled to fight! The foregoing [254]supposition is by no means an unnatural one; and truly, if the new constitution be adopted, I have little doubt, but the thing itself will some time or other be realized. I shall by way of digression add one sentiment, namely, that I should have no objection, that the slaves in the United States would free themselves to-morrow from their present thraldom, provided no lives be lost on this occasion; and with this proviso, I sincerely pray, that God may grant them success in their first attempt. Freedom is the birth-right of every man; and who is he that hath dared to rob his fellow men of this glorious privilege, with whom God will not enter into judgment?? Before I dismiss this subject, I cannot help taking notice of the inconsistency of some Pennsylvanians, in respect to this new government. The very men, who should oppose it with all their influence, seem to be the most zealous for establishing it. Strange indeed! that the professed enemies of negro and every other species of slavery, should themselves join in the adoption of a constitution whose very basis is despotism and slavery, a constitution that militates so far against freedom, that even their own religious liberty may probably be destroyed by it. Alas! what frail, what inconsistent beings we are! To the catalogue of human weaknesses and mistakes, this is one to be added. Ah! my countrymen, our situation is critical indeed! Let us make a solemn pause then! The eyes of the world are upon us; the patriots and friends of America, in Europe, are now anxiously concerned, lest the whirlwind of tyranny should raze from its tender root the hallowed plant of Columbian liberty. Before we confirm this new constitution, let us ask ourselves this question�For what did we withdraw our allegiance from Great Britain; was it because the yoke of George the third was not sufficiently galling, that we cast it off, at the expence of so much blood and treasure, in order to accommodate ourselves with one of our own construction more intolerable? or, was it because the tyrant was three thousand miles off, that we revolted, in order to appoint one at home, who should correct us with scorpions instead of whips? If this were your design, I congratulate you on your success; hesitate not a moment then in the adoption of the new constitution: It is a perfect model, and answers your intentions completely. It certainly is capable of carrying tyranny and despotism to their ne plus ultra, no second revolution will be necessary, no further attempt need be made on this head; for this government will answer the end proposed to all intents and purposes. Are these groundless conjectures, mere declamations unsupported by evidence, or affirmations without proof? No truly�Read the Old Whig, read the Centinels, read Brutus, Cincinnatus, &c. and then say, if you [255]can, that these things are not real. Perhaps better arguments were never advanced in the demonstration of any truth, than these writers have given to illustrate this matter; whilst the writers on the opposite side have not been able to refute them in a single instance. I shall close this essay with one observation, viz. that should this despotic scheme of government be overthrown, (which God grant) to what cause then are we to attribute this glorious triumph? The answer is obvious�to that palladium of liberty, that inestimable privilege of freemen, that scourge of tyranny, the freedom of the press: ?and to the honor of Philadelphia, let it be remembered, that her Independent Gazetteer, her Freeman�s Journal, &c, were the first heralds that sounded the alarm, and that engaged in this noble struggle, which, I trust, will terminate in favour of liberty, and in this victory a whole continent will be freed from bondage.?"
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/28/1787,"Mr. printer, Many people seem to be convinced that the proposed constitution is liable to a number of important objections; that there are defects in it which ought to be supplied, and errors which ought to be amended; but they apprehend that we must either receive this constitution in its present form, or be left without any continental government whatsoever. To be sure, if this were the case, it would be most prudent for us, like a man who is wedded to a bad wife, to submit to our misfortune with patience, and make the best of a bad bargain. But if we will summon up resolution sufficient to examine into our true circumstances, we shall find that we are not in so deplorable a situation as people have been taught to believe, from the suggestions of interested men, who wish to force down the proposed plan of government without delay, for the purpose of providing offices for themselves and their friends. We shall find, that, with a little wisdom and patience, we have it yet in our power, not only to establish a federal constitution, but to establish a good one. It is true that the continental convention has directed their proposed constitution to be laid before a convention of delegates to be chosen in each state, �for their assent and ratification,� which seems to preclude the idea of any power in the several conventions, of proposing any alterations, or indeed of even rejecting the plan proposed, if they should disapprove of it. Still, however, the question recurs, what authority the late convention had to bind the people of the United States, to any particular form of government, or to forbid them to adopt such form of government as they should think fit. I know it is a language frequent in the mouths of some heaven-born Phaetons amongst us, who like the son of Apollo, think themselves entitled to guide the chariot of the sun; that common people have no right to judge of the affairs of government; that they are not fit for it; that they should leave these matters to their superiors. This however, is not the language of men of real understanding, even among the advocates for the proposed constitution; but these still [249]recognize the authority of the people, and will admit, at least in words, that the people have a right to be consulted. Then I ask, if the people in the different states have a right to be consulted, in the new form of continental government, what authority could the late convention have to preclude them from proposing amendments to the plan they should offer? Had the convention any right to bind the people to the form of government they should propose? Let us consider this matter. The late convention were chosen by the general assembly of each state; they had the sanction of Congress;�for what? To consider what alterations were necessary to be made in the articles of confederation. What have they done? They have made a new constitution for the United States. I will not say, that in doing so, they have exceeded their authority; but on the other hand, I trust that no man of understanding amongst them will pretend to say, that any thing they did or could do, was of the least avail to lessen the rights of the people to judge for themselves in the last resort. This right, is perhaps, unalienable, but at all events, there is no pretence for saying that this right was ever meant to be surrendered up into the hands of the late continental convention. The people have an undoubted right to judge of every part of the government which is offered to them: No power on earth has a right to preclude them; and they may exercise this choice either by themselves or their delegates legally chosen to represent them in the State�Convention.�I venture to say that no man, reasoning upon revolution principles, can possibly controvert this right. Indeed very few go so far as to controvert the right of the people to propose amendments; but we are told that the thing is impracticable; that if we begin to propose amendments there will be no end to them; that the several states will never agree in their amendments; that we shall never unite in any plan; that if we reject this we shall either have a worse or none at all; that we ought therefore to adopt this at once, without alteration or amendment.�Now these are very kind gentlemen, who insist upon doing so much good for us, whether we will or not. Idiots and maniacs ought certainly to be restrained from doing themselves mischief, and should be compelled to that which is for their own good. Whether the people of America are to be considered in this light, and treated accordingly, is a question which deserves, perhaps, more consideration than it has yet received. A contest between the patients and their doctors, which are mad or which are fools, might possibly be a very unhappy one. I hope at least that we shall be able to settle this important business without so preposterous a dispute. What then would you have us do, it may be asked? Would you have us adopt the proposed Constitution or reject it? I answer that I would neither wish the one nor [250]the other. Though I would be far from pretending to dictate to the representatives of the people what steps ought to be pursued, yet a method seems to present itself so simple, so perfectly calculated to obviate all difficulties, to reconcile us with one another, and establish unanimity and harmony among the people of this country, that I cannot forbear to suggest it. I hope that most of my readers have already anticipated me in what I am about to propose. Whether they have or not, I shall venture to state it, in the humble expectations that it may have some tendency to reconcile honest men of all parties with one another. The method I would propose is this� 1st. Let the Conventions of each state, as they meet, after considering the proposed Constitution, state their objections and propose their amendments. So far from these objections and amendments clashing with each other in irreconcileable discord, as it has been too often suggested they would do, it appears that from what has been hitherto published in the different states in opposition to the proposed Constitution, we have a right to expect that they will harmonize in a very great degree. The reason I say so, is, that about the same time, in very different parts of the continent, the very same objections have been made, and the very same alterations proposed by different writers, who I verily believe, know nothing at all of each other, and were very far from acting a premeditated concert, and that others who have not appeared as writers in the newspapers, in the different states, have appeared to act and speak in perfect unison with those objections and amendments, particularly in the article of a Bill of Rights. That in short, the very same sentiments seem to have been echoed from the different parts of the continent by the opposers of the proposed Constitution, and these sentiments have been very little contradicted by its friends, otherwise than by suggesting their fears, that by opposing the Constitution at present proposed, we might be disappointed of any federal government or receive a worse one than the present.�It would be a most delightful surprize to find ourselves all of one opinion at last; and I cannot forbear hoping that when we come fairly to compare our sentiments, we shall find ourselves much more nearly agreed than in the hurry and surprize in which we have been involved on this subject, than we ever suffered ourselves to imagine. 2d. When the Conventions have stated these objections and amendments, let them transmit them to Congress and adjourn, praying that Congress will direct another Convention to be called from the different states, to consider of these objections and amendments, and pledging themselves to abide by whatever decision shall be made by such future [251]Convention on the subject; whether it be to amend the proposed Constitution or to reject any alteration and ratify it as it stands. 3d. If a new Convention of the United States should meet, and revise the proposed Constitution, let us agree to abide by their decision.�It is past a doubt that every good citizen of America pants for an efficient federal government�I have no doubt we shall concur at last in some plan of continental government, even if many people could imagine exceptions to it; but if the exceptions which are made at present, shall be maturely considered and even be pronounced by our future representatives as of no importance; (which I trust they will not) even in that case, I have no doubt that almost every man, will give up his own private opinion and concur in that decision. 4th. If by any means another Continental Convention should fail to meet, then let the Conventions of the several states again assemble and at last decide the great solemn question whether we shall adopt the Constitution now proposed, or reject it? And, whenever it becomes necessary to decide upon this point, one at least who from the beginning has been invariably anxious for the liberty and independence of his country, will concur in adopting and supporting this Constitution, rather than none;�though I confess I could easily imagine, some other form of confederation, which I should think better entitled to my hearty approbation;�and indeed I am not afraid of a worse."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,11/30/1787,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Friends, Countrymen and fellow Citizens, That the present confederation is inadequate to the objects of the union, seems to be universally allowed. The only question is, what additional powers are wanting to give due energy to the federal government? We should, however, be [318]careful in forming our opinion on this subject, not to impute the temporary and extraordinary difficulties that has hitherto impeded the execution of the confederation, to defects in the system itself. Taxation is in every government, a very delicate and difficult subject; hence it has been the policy of all wise statesmen, as far as circumstances permitted, to lead the people by small beginnings and almost imperceptible degrees, into the habits of taxation; where the contrary conduct has been pursued, it has ever failed of full success, not unfrequently proving the ruin of the projectors. The imposing of a burdensome tax at once on a people, without the usual gradations, is the severest test that any government can be put to, despotism itself has often proved unequal to the attempt. Under this conviction, let us take a review of our situation before and since the revolution. From the first settlement of the country(a) until the commencement of the late war, the taxes were so light and trivial as to be scarcely felt by the people; when we engaged in the expensive contest with Great Britain, the Congress sensible of the difficulty of levying the monies necessary to its support, by direct taxation, had recourse to an anticipation of the public resources, by emitting bills of credit, and thus postponed the necessity of taxation for several years; this means was pursued to a most ruinous length; but about the year 80 or 81, it was wholly exhausted, the bills of credit had suffered such a depreciation from the excessive quantities in circulations, that they ceased to be useful as a medium. The country at this period, was very much impoverished and exhausted; commerce had been suspended for near six years; the husbandman, for want of a market, limited his crops to his own subsistence; the frequent calls of the militia and long continuance in actual service, the devastations of the enemy, the subsistance of our own armies, the evils of the depreciation of the paper money, which fell chiefly upon the patriotic and virtuous part of the community, had all concurred to produce great distress throughout America. In this situation of affairs, we still had the same powerful enemy to contend with, who had even more numerous and better appointed armies in the field than at any former time. Our allies were applied to in this exigence, but the pecuniary assistance that we could procure from them, was soon exhausted; the only resource now remaining, was to obtain by direct taxation, the monies necessary for our defence; the history of mankind does not furnish a similar instance of an attempt to levy such enormous taxes at once, of a people so wholly unprepared and uninured to them�the lamp of sacred liberty(b) must indeed have burned with unsullied lustre, every sordid principle of the mind must have been then extinct, when the people not only submitted to the grievous impositions, but cheerfully exerted themselves to comply with the calls of their [319]country; their abilities however, were not equal to furnish the necessary sums�indeed the requisition of the year 1782, amounted to the whole income of their farms and other property, including the means of their subsistance; perhaps the strained exertions of two years, would not have sufficed to the discharge of this requisition; how then can we impute the difficulties of the people to a due compliance with the requisitions of Congress to a defect in the confederation, for any government, however energetic, in similar circumstances, would have experienced the same fate. If we review the proceedings of the states, we shall find that they gave every sanction and authority to the requisitions of Congress, that their laws could confer, that they attempted to collect the sums called for in the same manner as is proposed to be done in future by the general government, instead of the state legislatures. It is a maxim that a government, ought to be cautious not to govern over much, for when the cord of power is drawn too tight, it generally proves its destruction, the impracticability of complying with the requisitions of Congress has lessened the sense of obligation and duty in the people, and thus weakened the ties of the union; the opinion of power in a free government is much more efficatious than the exercise of it; it requires the maturity of time and repeated practice to give due energy and certainty to the operations of government, especially to such as affect the purses of the people. The thirteen Swiss Cantons confederated by more general and weaker ties than these United States are by the present articles of confederation, have not experienced the necessity of strengthening their union by vesting their general diet with further or greater powers; this national body has only the management of their foreign concerns and in case of a war can only call by requisition on the several Cantons for the necessary supplies, who are sovereign and independent in every internal and local exercise of government�and yet this rope of sand, as our confederation has been termed, which is so similar to that, has held together for ages without any apparent charm.(c) I am persuaded that a due consideration, will evince, that the present inefficacy of the requisitions of Congress, is not owing to a defect in the confederation, but the peculiar circumstances of the times. The wheels of the general government having been thus clogged and the arrearages of taxes still accumulating, it may be asked what prospect is their of the government resuming its proper tone, unless more compulsory powers are granted? To this it may be answered, that the produce of imposts on commerce which all agree to vest in Congress, together with the immense tracts of land at their disposal, will rapidly lessen and eventually discharge the present incumbrances; when this [320]takes place, the mode by requisi[ti]on will be found perfectly adequate to the extraordinary exigencies of the union. Congress have lately sold land to the amount of eight millions of dollars, which is a considerable portion of the whole debt. It is to be lamented that the interested and designing have availed themselves so successfully of the present crisis, and under the specious pretence of having discovered a panacea for all the ills of the people, they are about establishing a system of government, that will prove more destructive to them, than the wooden horse filled with soldiers did in ancient times to the city of Troy; this horse was introduced by their hostile enemy the Grecians, by a prostitution of the sacred rights(d) of their religion; in like manner, my fellow citizens are aspiring despots among yourselves prostituting the name of a Washington to cloak their designs upon your liberties. I would ask how is the proposed government to shower down those treasures upon every class of citizens as is so industriously inculcated and so fondly believed? Is it by the addition of numerous and expensive establishments? Is it by doubling our judiciaries, instituting federal courts in every county of every state? Is it by a superb presidential court? Is it by a large standing army? In short is it by putting it in the power of the future government to levy money at pleasure, and placing this government so independent of the people as to enable the administration to gratify every corrupt passion of the mind, to riot on your spoils, without check or controul? A transfer to Congress of the power of imposing imposts on commerce and the unlimited regulation of trade, I believe is all that is wanting to render America as prosperous as it is in the power of any form of government to render her; this properly understood would meet the views of all the honest and well meaning. What gave birth to the late Continental Convention? Was it not the situation of our commerce, which lay at the mercy of every foreign power, who from motives of interest or enmity could restrict and controul it, without risquing a retaliation on the part of America, as Congress was impotent on this subject? Such indeed was the case with respect to Britain, whose hostile regulations gave such a stab to our navigation as to threaten its annihilation, it became the interest of even the American merchant to give a preference to foreign bottoms; hence the distress of our seamen, shiprights, and every mechanic art dependent on navigation. By these regulations too we were limitted in markets for our produce, our vessels were excluded from their West-India Islands, many of our staple commodities were denied entrance in Britain; hence the husbandmen [321]were distressed by the demand for their crops being lessened and their prices reduced. This is the source to which may be traced every evil we experience, that can be relieved by a more energetic government. Recollect the language of complaint for years past, impare(e) the recommendations of Congress founded on such complaints, pointing out the remedy, examine the reasons assigned by the different states for appointing delegates to the late Convention, view the powers vested in that body; they all harmonize in one sentiment, that the due regulation of trade and navigation was the anxious wish of every class of citizens, was the great object of calling the Convention. This object being provided for, by the proposed Constitution, the people overlook and are not sensible of the needless sacrifice they are making for it.�Of what avail will be a prosperous state of commerce, when the produce of it will be at the absolute disposal of an arbitrary and unchecked government, who may levy at pleasure the most oppressive taxes; who may destroy every principle of freedom; who may even destroy the privilege of complaining.(f) If you are in doubt about the nature and principles of the proposed government, view the conduct of its authors and patrons, that affords the best explanation, the most striking comment. The evil genius of darkness presided at its birth, it came forth under the veil of mystery, its true features being carefully concealed, and every deceptive art has been and is practising to have this spurious brat received as the genuine offspring of heaven-born liberty. So fearful are its patrons that you should discern the imposition, that they have hurried on its adoption, with the greatest precipitation; they have endeavored also to preclude all investigation, they have endeavored to intimidate all opposition; by such means as these, have they surreptitiously procured a Convention in this state, favorable to their views;2 and here again investigation and discussion are abridged, the final question is moved before the subject has been under consideration;3 an appeal to the people is precluded even in the last resort, lest their eyes should be opened; the Convention have denied the minority the privilege of entering the reasons of their dissent on its journals4�Thus despotism is already triumphant, and the genius of liberty is on the eve of her exit, is about bidding an eternal adieu to this once happy people. After so recent a triumph over British despots, after such torrents of blood and treasure have been spent, after involving ourselves in the distresses of an arduous war, and incurring such a debt, for the express purpose of asserting the rights of humanity, it is truly astonishing that a set of men among ourselves, should have the effrontery to attempt the [322]destruction of our liberties. But in this enlightened age to hope to dupe the people by the arts they are practising, is still more extraordinary. How do the advocates of the proposed government, combat the objections urged against it? Not even by an attempt to disprove them, for that would the more fully confirm their truth, but by a species of reasoning that is very congenial to that contempt of the understandings of the people, that they so eminently possess, and which policy cannot even prevent frequent ebullitions of; they seem to think that the oratory and facination of great names and mere sound will suffice to ensure success; that the people may be diverted from a consideration of the merits of the plan, by bold assertions and mere declamation. Some of their writers for instance, paint the distresses of every class of citizens with all the glowing language of eloquence, as if this was a demonstration of the excellence, or even(g) the safety of the new plan, which, notwithstanding the reality of this distress, may be a system of tyranny and oppression; other writers tell you of the great men who composed the late convention, and give you a pompous display of their virtues, instead of a justification of the plan of government; and others again urge the tyrant�s plea, they endeavor to make it a case of necessity, now is the critical moment; they represent the adoption of this government as our only alternative, as the last opportunity we shall have of peaceably establishing a government; they assert it to be the best system that can be formed, and that if we reject it, we will have a worse one or none at all, nay, that if we presume to propose alterations, we shall get into a labyrinth of difficulties from which we cannot be extricated, as no two states will agree in amendments, that therefore it would involve us in irreconcilable discord. But they all seduously avoid the fair field of argument, a rational investigation into the origination(h) of the proposed government. I hope the good sense of the people will detect the fallacy of such conduct, will discover the base juggle and with becoming resolution resent the imposition. That the powers of Congress ought to be strengthened, all allow, but is this a conclusive proof of the necessity to adopt the proposed plan; is it a proof that because the late convention, in the first essay upon so arduous and difficult a subject, harmonised in their ideas, that a future convention will not, or that after a full investigation and mature consideration of the objections, they will not plan a better government and one more agreeable to the sentiments of America, or is it any proof that they can never again agree in any plan? The late convention must indeed have been inspired, as some of its advocates have asserted, to admit the truth of these positions, or even to admit the possibility of the proposed government, being such a one as America ought to adopt; for this body [323]went upon original ground, foreign from their intentions or powers, they must therefore have been wholly uninformed of the sentiments of their constituents in respect to this form of government, as it was not in their contemplation when the convention was appointed to erect a new government, but to strengthen the old one. Indeed they seem to have been determined to monopolize the exclusive merit of the discovery, or rather as if darkness was essential to its success they precluded all communication with the people, by closing their doors; thus the well disposed members unassisted by public information and opinion, were induced by those arts that are now practising on the people, to give their sanction to this system of despotism. Is there any reason to presume that a new Convention will not agree upon a better plan of government? Quite the contrary, for perhaps there never was such a coincidence(i) on any occasion as on the present, the opponents to the proposed plan, at the same time in every part of the continent, harmonised in the same objections; such an uniformity of opposition is without example and affords the strongest demonstration of its solidity. Their objections too arc not local, are not confined to the interests of any one particular state to the prejudice of the rest, but with a philanthropy and liberality that reflects lustre on humanity, that dignifies the character of America, they embrace the interests and happiness of the whole union, they do not even condescend to minute blemishes, but shew that the main pillars of the fabric are bad, that the essential principles of liberty and safety are not to be found in it, that despotism will be the necessary and inevitable consequence of its establishment."
Newspaper,No,Many Customers,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/1/1787,"It has been often said, concerning the proposed Constitution, that those who complained of its faults should suggest amendments. A number of citizens, warmly desirous of promoting the establishment of a well-organized federal government and perceiving in each other sentiments inclining to harmony, formed a committee of their own members to examine and consider the proposed Constitution, with instructions to report such amendments, and such only, as they should deem absolutely necessary to safety in the adoption of it, paying equal regard to its practicability and efficiency as a system of government,�on the one hand, and to those rights which are essential to free citizens in a state of society on the other. The report having been read, a motion was made to adopt it; but after some debate, in which some of the members declared that their minds had already undergone some changes, and that their opinions were not yet satisfactorily established, it was thought proper that further time should be taken to deliberate and advise with their fellow citizens on a subject of such high importance and general concernment. It was therefore agreed that the question should be postponed for further consideration, and that in the meantime the report be published. By giving it a place in your paper you will oblige MANY CUSTOMERS. The committee to whom was referred the plan proposed by the late General Convention, for the government of the United States, report, That in the examination of the said plan, they have conceived it to be their duty to exercise the freedom which the magnitude of the trust reposed in them required; at the same time, that they have kept constantly in mind the respect and deference due to the great characters who formed the plan, and that candor and liberality of construction which are necessary in forming a just opinion of a national compact in which the citizens of every state in the Union, having an equal interest, are equally parties. Under these impressions, your committee have taken the said plan into their most serious consideration; and though they find much in it which merits approbation, yet the duty they owe to their constituents and to their country obliges them to propose some alterations, which they should deem necessary considering it merely with regard to practicability as a system of government. And when to this consideration are added the propriety of preserving to the respective states so much of their sovereignty as may be necessary to enable them to manage their internal concerns, and to perform their respective functions as members of a federal republic, and of preserving to individuals such rights as are essential to freemen in a state of society, the necessity of making such alterations appear to your committee irresistibly strong. There are four points in which your committee apprehend alterations are absolutely necessary before the plan can with safety be put in operation, namely: respecting elections, internal taxation, the judicial department, the legislative power, so far as it is independent of the House of Representatives. Divers other amendments might with propriety be proposed, some�of which might be comprehended in a bill of rights or table of fundamental principles so declared and established as to govern the construction of the powers given by the Constitution; but your committee avoid to mention them in detail, because if suitable amendments are made respecting the points enumerated, the necessity for going further on the present occasion, though not entirely done away, will be so far diminished as that it may be thought advisable to leave them to future consideration on such suggestions as time and experience shall offer. Your committee therefore proposes the following amendments: Article I, section 4. Strike out these words�but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators. Article I, section 8. Strike out�tax�and�excises�(and so throughout the plan make such amendments as may be necessary in conformity with this idea. At the end of the clause, add��To make requisitions, in the proportion aforesaid, on the several states in the Union, for such supplies of money as shall be necessary, in aid of the other revenues, for these purposes; leaving to the states respectively, the mode of levying and collecting the same: Provided that if any state shall neglect or refuse to pass an act for complying with any such requisition, or shall otherwise neglect or refuse to pay its quota of any such requisition within the time therein limited, it shall be in the power of the Congress on any such delinquency, by law, to direct the levying and collecting of such quota, together with such farther sum as may be necessary to defray the expense thereof, and interest from the time it ought to have been paid, from the persons and estates of the inhabitants of such delinquent state, according to the mode of assessment by law established in such state; or in default of such establishment, by such modes and means as the Congress shall by law establish for that purpose.� Article 3, section 2, clause 1st. Strike out the words,�between citizens of different states. After the words �between a state,� strike out,�or the citizens thereof. Clause 2d. Strike out,�both as to law and fact. These two clauses will then stand as follows: �The judicial power shall extend to cases in law and equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens�of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states; and between a state and foreign states, citizens or subjects. �In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before-mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.� Article 6, clause 2. After the word �notwithstanding,� insert, �provided that every such treaty which shall hereafter be made shall have been laid before the House of Representatives and have obtained the approbation of so many of the members of that House as shall be a majority of the whole number elected.� And your committee submit the following resolutions to consideration. That the foregoing amendments to the plan of government formed by the late General Convention be transmitted to the United States in Congress assembled. That Congress be requested to recommend to the several states in the Union that delegates be elected by the people of the said states respectively, to meet in general convention at ________ on the ________day of _______ next, take into consideration the said amendments together with such amendments as shall be proposed by the several state conventions, and to revise and amend the said plan of government in such manner as they shall agree upon, not altering the form as it now stands farther than shall be necessary to accommodate it to such of the amendments which shall be so proposed to them, as they, or the representation of any nine or more states, shall agree to adopt; and that in case the plan so agreed upon shall be assented to by the vote of every state which shall be represented in such convention, they shall have power, without further reference to the people, to declare the same the constitution or frame of government of the United States, and it shall thereupon be accepted and acted upon accordingly."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/4/1787,"To the people of pennsylvania. Friends, Countrymen, and Fellow-Citizens, Mr. Wilson in a speech delivered in our Convention on Saturday the 24th instant,2 has conceded, nay forceably proved, that one consolidated government, will not answer for so extensive a territory as the United States includes, that slavery would be the necessary fate of the people under such a government; his words are so remarkable, that I cannot forbear reciting them, they are as follows, viz. �The extent of country for which the new constitution was required, produced another difficulty in the business of the federal convention. It is the opinion of some celebrated writers, that to a small territory, the democratical, to a middling territory, (as Montesquieu has termed it) the monarchical, and, to an extensive territory, the despotic form of government, is best adapted.3 Regarding then, the wide and almost unbounded jurisdiction of the United States, at first view, the hand of despotism seemed necessary to controul, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarrasment rose. For, we knew that, although our constituents would chearfully submit to the legislative [344]restraints of a free government, they would spurn at every attempt to shackle them with despotic power.� See page 5 of the printed speech. And again in page 7, he says �Is it probable that the dissolution of the state governments, and the establishment of one consolidated empire, would be eligible in its nature, and satisfactory to the people in its administration? I think not, as I have given reasons to shew that so extensive a territory could not be governed, connected, and preserved, but by the supremacy of despotic power. All the exertions of the most potent emperors of Rome were not capable of keeping that empire together, which, in extent, was far inferior to the dominion of America.� This great point having been now confirmed by the concession of Mr. Wilson, though indeed it was self evident before, and the writers against the proposed plan of government, having proved to demonstration, that the powers proposed to be vested in Congress, will necessarily annihilate and absorb the state Legislatures and judiciaries and produce from their wreck one consolidated government, the question is determined. Every man therefore who has the welfare of his country at heart, every man who values his own liberty and happiness, in short, every description of persons, except those aspiring despots who hope to benefit by the mysery and vassalage of their countrymen, must now concur in rejecting the proposed system of government, must now unite in branding its authors with the stigma of eternal infamy. The anniversary of this great escape from the fangs of despotism, ought to be celebrated as long as liberty shall continue to be dear to the citizens of America. I will repeat some of my principal arguments, and add some further remarks, on the subject of consolidation. The Legislative is the highest delegated power in government, all others are subordinate to it. The celebrated Montesquieu establishes it as a maxim, that legislation necessarily follows the power of taxation. By the 8th sect, of article the 1st of the proposed government, �the Congress are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare4 of the United States.� Now, what can be more comprehensive than these words? Every species of taxation, whether external or internal are included. Whatever taxes, duties, and excises that the Congress may deem necessary to the general welfare may be imposed on the citizens of these states and levied by their officers. The congress are to be the absolute judges of the propriety of such taxes, in short they may construe every purpose for which the state legislatures now lay taxes, to be for the general welfare, they may seize upon every source of taxation, and thus make it impracticable for the states to have the smallest revenue, [345]and if a state should presume to impose a tax or excise that would interfere with a federal tax or excise, congress may soon terminate the contention, by repealing the state law, by virtue of the following section��To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department thereof.� Indeed every law of the states may be controuled by this power. The legislative power granted for these sections is so unlimited in its nature, may be so comprehensive and boundless in its exercise, that this alone would be amply sufficient to carry the coup de grace to the state governments, to swallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire. But the legislative has an able auxiliary in the judicial department, for a reference to my second number5 will shew that this may be made greatly instrumental in effecting a consolidation; as the federal judiciary would absorb all others. Lest the foregoing powers should not suffice to consolidate the United States into one empire, the Convention as if determined to prevent the possibility of a doubt, as if to prevent all clashing by the opposition of state powers, as if to preclude all struggle for state importance, as if to level all obstacles to the supremacy of universal sway, which in so extensive a territory, would be an iron-handed despotism, have ordained by article the 6th, �That this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.� The words �pursuant to the constitution� will be no restriction to the authority of congress; for the foregoing sections gives them unlimited legislation; their unbounded power of taxation does alone include all others, as whoever has the purse strings will have full dominion. But the convention has superadded another power, by which the congress may stamp with the sanction of the constitution every possible law; it is contained in the following clause��To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.� Whatever law-congress may deem necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of the powers vested in them, may be enacted; and by virtue of this clause, they may controul and abrogate any and every of the laws of the state governments, on the allegation that they interfere with the execution of any of their powers, and yet these laws will �be made in pursuance of the constitution,� and of course will �be the supreme law of the [346]land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.� There is no reservation made in the whole of this plan in favor of the rights of the separate states. In the present plan of confederation made in the year 1778, it was thought necessary by article the 2d to declare that �each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.� Positive grant was not then thought sufficiently descriptive and restrictive upon congress, and the omission of such a declaration now, when such great devolutions of power are proposed, manifests the design of consolidating the states. What restriction does Mr. Wilson pretend there is in the new constitution to the supremacy of despotic sway over the United States?6 What barrier does he assign for the security of the state governments? Why truly a mere cobweb of a limit! by interposing the shield of what will become mere form, to check the reality of power. He says, that the existence of the state governments are essential to the organization of congress, that the former is made the necessary basis of the latter, for the federal senators and president are to be appointed by the state legislatures; and that hence all fears of a consolidation are groundless and imaginary. It must be confessed, as reason and argument would have been foreign to the defence of the proposed plan of government, Mr. Wilson has displayed much ingenuity on this occasion, he has involved the subject in all the mazes of sophistry, and by subtil distinctions, he has established principles and positions, that exist only in his own fertile imagination. It is a solecism in politics for two co-ordinate sovereignties to exist together, you must separate the sphere of their jurisdiction, or after running the race of dominion for some time, one would necessarily triumph over the other; but in the mean time the subjects of it would be harrassed with double impositions to support the contention; however the strife between congress and the states could not be of long continuance, for the former has a decisive superiority in the outset, and has moreover the power by the very constitution itself to terminate it, when expedient. As this necessary connexion, as it has been termed, between the state governments and the general government, has been made a point of great magnitude by the advocates of the new plan, as it is the only obstacle alledged by them against a consolidation, it ought to be well considered. It is declared by the proposed plan, that the federal senators and the electors who chuse the president of the United States, shall be appointed by the state legislatures for the long period of six and four [347]years respectively;�how will this connexion prevent the state legislatures being divested of every important, every efficient power? may not they, will not they dwindle into mere boards of appointment, as has ever happened in other nations to public bodies, who, in similar circumstances, have been so weak as to part with the essentials of power? Does not history abound with such instances? And this may be the mighty amount of this inseparable connexion, which is so much dwelt upon as the security of the state governments. Yet even this shadow of a limit against consolidation, may be annihilated by the imperial fiat, without any violation of even the forms of the constitution, section 4th of article the 1st has made a provision for this, when the people are sufficiently fatigued with the useless expence of maintaining the forms of departed power and security, and when they shall pray to be relieved from the imposition. This section cannot be too often repeated, as it gives such a latitude to the designing, as it revokes every other part of the constitution that may be tolerable, and as it may enable the administration under it, to complete the system of despotism; it is in the following words, viz. �The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or after such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.� The only apparent restriction in this clause, is as to the place of appointing senators, but even this may be rendered of no avail, for as the Congress have the controul over the time of appointment of both senators and representatives, they may under the pretence of an apprehension of invasion, upon the pretence of the turbulence of what they may stile a faction, and indeed pretences are never wanting to the designing, they may postpone the time of the election of the senators and the representatives from period to period to perpetuity; thus they may and if they may, they certainly will from the lust of dominion, so inherent in the mind of man, relieve the people from the trouble of attending elections by condescending to create themselves. Has not Mr. Wilson avowed it in fact? Has he not said in the Convention, that it was necessary that Congress should possess this power as the means of its own preservation, otherwise says he, an invasion, a civil war, a faction, or a secession of a minority of the assembly might prevent the representation of a state in Congress. The advocates of the proposed government must be hard driven, when they represent, that because the legislatures of this and the other states have exceeded the due bounds of power, notwithstanding every guard provided by their constitutions; that because the lust of arbitrary sway is so powerful as sometimes to get the better of every obstacle; that therefore we should give full scope to it, for that all restriction would be [348]useless and nugatory. And further, when they tell you that a good administration will atone for all the defects in the government, which, say they, you must necessarily have, for how can it be otherwise, your rulers are to be taken from among yourselves.7 My fellow citizens, these aspiring despots, must indeed have a great contempt for your understandings, when they hope to gull you out of your liberties by such reasoning; for what is the primary object of government, but to check and controul the ambitious and designing, how then can moderation and virtue be expected from men, who will be in possession of absolute sway, who will have the United States at their disposal? They would be more than men, who could resist such temptation! their being taken from among the people, would be no security; tyrants are of native growth in all countries, the greatest bashaw in Turky has been one of the people, as Mr. Wilson tells you the president-general will be. What consolation would this be, when you shall be suffering under his oppression."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,12/5/1787,"Joel ii. 15. �Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly. Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders: Gather the children, and those that suck the breasts, let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. Let the priests, the ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them.�2 My Fellow-Citizens, Are you disposed to hear plain arguments, simple truths, and pure facts? If you are; then let me tell you, thro� the voice of reason, that the preservation of your little ones and yourselves, the love of mankind in general, and the liberty of your dear country, now demand your most serious attention. The peace, the freedom, and happiness of the present generation, and possibly many succeeding ones, are the great subjects now under discussion. Was there ever such an important time for America as this is? Can there be greater objects than these are, presented to the human understanding? I say there cannot: and I affirm it, that there is not a man in the United States, except some base assassin, or mean coward, who can be indifferent on this momentous occasion. Is there any one now among us who can remain unconcerned or neutral? If there be, I say he is not a man; no certainly, he is unworthy of that character; such a wretch can have no claim to the title of a free citizen of America, he is a pitiful sycophant, a cringing spaniel, a menial slave. The independence of America, with great propriety, was thought, during our late glorious struggle, an object of such immense value, that we could scarce pay too high a price for it; an object that even dignified human nature; and that thousands of our countrymen magnanimously and cheerfully paid their blood for its purchase. But, great as this was, I say that the adoption of the new constitution is an object of much greater concern. The parents of a child may rejoice at his birth, as a happy circumstance, but his character and conduct in manhood only can give real and permanent pleasure; if these be bad, their pain is increased by disappointment; the recollection of their former joyous hopes, now augments their misery; yea, the misconduct of a son has frequently compelled his parents to curse the very day of his nativity. In this relation, the independence of America, and the new constitution exactly coincide. For if we adopt this plan of government in its present form; I say that we shall have reason to curse the day that America became independent. Horrid thought! that the greatest blessing God ever bestowed on a nation, should terminate in its misery and disgrace. Strange reverse this! that the freemen of America, the favored of heaven, should submit to a government so arbitrary in its embrio, that even a bill of rights cannot be obtained, to secure to the people their unalienable privileges. It was a common saying among many sensible men in Great Britain and Ireland, in the time of the war, that they doubted whether the great men of America, who had taken an active part in favor of independence, were influenced by pure patriotism: that it was not the love of their country they had so much at heart, as their own private interest; that a thirst after dominion and power, and not to protect the oppressed from the oppressor, was the great operative principle that induced these men to oppose Britain so strenuously. This seemingly illiberal sentiment, was however generally denied by the well-hearted and unsuspecting friends of American liberty in Europe, who could not suppose that men would engage in so noble a cause through such base motives. But alas! the truth of the sentiment is now indisputably confirmed; facts are stubborn things, and these set the matter beyond controversy. The new constitution, and the conduct of its despotic advocates, shew that these men�s doubts were really well founded. Unparalleled duplicity! that men should oppose tyranny under a pretence of patriotism, that they might themselves become the tyrants. How does such villainy disgrace human nature! Ah, my fellow-citizens, you have been strangely deceived indeed; when the wealthy of your own country assisted you to expel the foreign tyrant, only with a view to substitute themselves in his stead. But ?we want an efficient federal government; we want an efficient federal government: this is the constant theme of the day. Well, my friends, I grant this. But what is the ultimate end of an efficient government: in what should it be efficient? I hope you anticipate my answer. The only thing in which a government should be efficient, is to protect the liberties, lives, and property of the people governed, from foreign and domestic violence. This, and this only is what every government should do effectually. For any government to do more than this is impossible, and every one that falls short of it is defective.?3 Let us now compare the new constitution with this legitimate definition of an efficient government, and we shall find that it has scarce a particle of an efficient government in its whole composition. In the first place then it does not protect the people in those liberties and privileges that all freemen should hold sacred�The liberty of conscience, the liberty of the press, the liberty of trial by jury, &c. are all unprotected by this constitution. And in respect to protecting our property it can have no pretensions whatever to that; for the taxes must and will be so enormously oppressive, for supporting this expensive government, that the whole produce of our farms would not be sufficient to pay them. As to this government being efficient, or rather sufficient to protect the people from the violence of a foreign enemy; the idea is so absurd that it offends common sense; it can neither have strength, energy, nor respectability, in the great scale of nations. For a new country to become strong and energetic, so as to be able to repel a foreign foe; the government must be free and patriotic, and the people must be wealthy and well-affected to it. Now if these requisites be wanting, that country is in jeopardy every moment; in fact it is on the direct road of falling a prey to the surrounding nations. In this miserable predicament, then, must America stand if we adopt the new constitution: for the government will neither be free nor patriotic, but on the contrary, despotic and oppressive; and the people will be abject slaves toiling to support a government, which they curse in their hearts: a government composed only of an emperor and a few lordlings, surrounded by thousands of blood-suckers, and cringing sycophants. And in respect to the standing army, it will only be made up of profligate idle ruffians, whose prowess will chiefly consist in feats of cruelty exercised on their innocent fellow citizens; but in facing a foreign foe, they will prove themselves a body of mean cowards; like the Turkish janizaries, better acquainted with plundering their country than fighting for its protection. In regard to a militia defending the country, the thing is still more absurd if possible. Who in his senses could suppose that people with their spirits broken by oppression, should voluntarily fight for that government, to which they are necessarily [352]disaffected? No truly, common sense would point out to government that its safety could not be the object of the people arming: and hence it is plain, that even were the militia willing to act, such a government would not trust them. Lastly, in respect to a navy, it is matter of mere moonshine, such an expensive government as this would be, could not spare as much money in fifty years, as would build three ships of the line. This is a short portrait of the efficiency of our efficient federal government. What think you of it, my fellow citizens?"
Petition,No,Cumberland County,Pennsylvania Convention,,,12/5/1787,"Messieurs Printers: In perusing your useful paper of the 28th instant [310page icon][November], I observed a petition signed, as is said, by the clergy, principal burgesses, members of the learned professions, and principal inhabitants of this place; and that except three or four persons to whom it was presented, all unanimously signed said petition. In order that it may be seen whether this is actually the case or not, I request you would insert the following petition, signed by upwards of one hundred and seventy in Carlisle, who, in their humble opinion, possess equally good means of information, and are as free from any private or party interest as these respectable signers. In complying with the above, you will oblige one of your readers. To the Honorable Convention of the State of Pennsylvania. The Petition of the Subscribers Inhabitants of the County of Cumberland. Most humbly showeth: That they consider the present political circumstances of the United States, as very interesting to every citizen who sincerely desires to support our Union, and at the same time to secure to the people the future enjoyment of their unalienable rights and liberties; and as the good of the people is the great end of all good government, and that must be best which affords the best security to their rights and freedom; a solicitude for their own permanent political happiness, and that of their fellow citizens, has induced your petitioners to lay before your honorable house some objections to the adoption of the Constitution, as proposed by the late Continental Convention. And first: There is no declaration of rights, to secure to the people the liberty of worshiping God according to their consciences; and the sixth Article of said Constitution declares �that this Constitution and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, etc.� Therefore the bill of rights contained in the constitutions of the several states are no security, nor are the people secured in the privileges of the common law. Secondly: The eighth section of the first Article of this Constitution declares, that the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof. This, as we conceive, unlimited powers given to Congress, in which they are to be the judges of what laws shall be necessary and proper, uncontrolled by a bill of rights, submits every right of the people of these states, both civil and sacred to the disposal of Congress, who may exercise their power to the expulsion of the jury�trial in civil causes�to the total suppression of the liberty of the press; and to the setting up and establishing of a cruel tyranny, if they should be so disposed, over all the dearest and most sacred rights of the citizens. Thirdly: The fourth section of the first Article provides, that the times, places, and manner for holding elections, for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed, etc. Here appears to be scarcely the shadow of representation provided, because the Congress may at their pleasure, order the election for the Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania, to be held in Philadelphia, where it will be impossible for the people of the state to assemble for the purpose; and thus the citizens of Philadelphia would be represented, and scarcely any part else of the commonwealth. The MANNER and TIME may prevent three-fourths of the present electors of the state, from giving a vote as long as they live. These objections, with many others which might be made, induce your petitioners to pray this honorable Convention not to adopt the said proposed plan, until a bill of rights shall be framed and annexed, so as to secure to the citizens of each state, such rights as have been mentioned (we mean to say) those relating to conscience, trial by jury, in civil causes, as well as in criminal cases; the liberty of the press, and such other liberties as to you may seem necessary to be secured and preserved. And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray, etc., etc."
Letter,No,Philadelphiensis,Eleazer Oswald,Independent Gazetteer,,12/5/1787,"Mr. oswald, Russell, the printer of the Massachusetts Centinel, has attempted to answer a remark I made on his conduct in refusing to publish a piece signed Lucius in his paper: Yet he allows that my observation was just; namely, �that it was not with the author of that piece [581]that the freemen of Massachusetts had any thing to do, but with his reasonings.� Now let him make this his rule in future, and then his paper will be free and patriotic; let his conduct quadrate with the sentiment that he admits to be just, and I am perfectly satisfied: All I wished for, or intended, was to have our presses unshackled in respect to the new constitution, the liberty of America required, that they should be open to all parties, but influenced by none; and this impartiality was certainly better observed in Philadelphia, when I wrote, than at Boston, and therefore I made the remark, which I hope will have the desired effect: Indeed from his own concessions I have good reason to believe that my animadversions have been useful in setting the presses free in Boston; and this is as much as I wanted. He is now obliged to let a scrap of Lucius appear, which probably would never have been the case, if I had not taken notice of the matter: But he has artfully given us no more than the thesis and smothered the rest; well this is still better than nothing.

Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/5/1787,"A correspondent observes, that the virtuous 24, who compose the minority of the Convention, obtained their seats in that body, by a much greater number of the votes of the people of Pennsylvania, than the 44 who compose the majority; yes the 24 had above 1000 more votes than the 44�and in Lancaster and other counties, which are there represented by part of those 44, the votes were nearly equally divided, between those who were in favor and those who were opposed to this government. Whilst in some other counties, few would vote for any members, as they declared that they had not time to make up their minds on this important business, so as to determine upon a proper choice of representatives. In the very large and populous county of Chester, there were but 500 votes given, and in Philadelphia County but 500; in Bucks, Northampton and Montgomery, not one-sixth part of the people voted, and by every account from the different parts of the state, the few that have been in favor of the proposed government have very much decreased and are changing their sentiments daily�that Whigs and Tories are now alarmed, and that in a month�s time there will not remain 500 people in all Pennsylvania in favor of the new government, except those who expect offices under it. And it is now reduced to a certainty that North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island will reject this [265page icon]new scheme of office making. The legislature of Maryland have called their deputies of the late Convention to give an account of their dark proceedings in that Convention; it is expected we shall hear from thence in a few days some important secrets. So that it is not very material, adds our correspondent, how this affair is decided by our Convention, who may only expose their arbitrary principles without any danger to their constituents."
Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,12/5/1787,"A correspondent informs us, that the 24 virtuous characters who compose the minority in the Convention are all men whose souls have been�tried�in the late glorious war (and that they are men of understanding, I believe the office hunters know to their sorrow). These 24 patriots obtained their seats in that body by above 1000 more votes than the whole 44 did. And we find that in Lancaster, York, Northumberland, and other counties, from which some of the 44 came, that the votes were nearly equally divided between those warmly opposed to the proposed Constitution and those who were in favor of it; and in some other counties, from which others of the 44 came, such as Montgomery, Chester, Bucks, Northampton, and Philadelphia counties, that not above one-fifth of the people would vote, or give any countenance to this Convention, as they considered it was called in a riotous, illegal manner, as well as with dangerous and unconstitutional precipitancy. And at this moment, from every account received from all parts of the state, it appears, that the few who had been in favor of the proposed plan (Whigs and Tories) are daily changing their sentiments concerning it, and declare they have been deceived; so that in a month there will not be 500 people in the state who will wish to have it adopted, except those who expect offices under it. But it is expected (and beyond a doubt it will be the case) that the greater part of the 44 will vote against this scheme of office making, although very great pains has been taken to deceive them in this town."
Newspaper,No,Columbus,,Pennsylvania Herald,,12/8/1787,"�Be the workmen that they may be, let us speak of the work.� Bacon�s Essays. A late publication in your paper, in the form of a report of a committee,2 has afforded both information and satisfaction to divers of your readers. It were to be wished that societies, of the kind of that to which the committee reported, were formed in every neighborhood, and that more time had been taken by the people, by such or other means, to possess themselves of a more accurate knowledge of a subject so highly interesting to every individual, before the men were fixed upon who should possess the power of deciding for them on a subject of the highest sublunary importance to them and their posterity. The members of the General Convention had the matter several months under daily discussion and debate. Every thought which occurred to anyone was communicated to and examined by everyone, so that everyone had time and opportunity to trace the purport and tendency of every clause and sentence, separately considered, as well as the probable effect and influence of the whole; but these deliberations were kept within their walls with the secrecy of a conclave. The people expected the result would be an amendment of the federal compact, on such points only as had been generally spoken of as defective. Their minds had been prepared for such amendments as they could easily judge of and come to a speedy decision upon. But, instead of the old instrument being repaired and amended, we are called upon to consider it as totally dissolved, and its component parts reduced to a state of nature. The Constitution proposed in its stead is confessedly, even by the framers of it, a NOVELTY in the practice of legislation, essentially different, both in principles and organization, from any system of government heretofore formed, either by force, fraud, accident, or the deliberate consent of a people. It may be, as some of its sanguine advocates have asserted, the best form that was ever offered to a people; but we should remember, that what may be, may not be; and however ready we may be to adopt measures on the credit of others in matters of lighter moment, the subject before us is certainly a matter of too much consequence to be decided upon without thorough examination, and more deliberation than the citizens of Pennsylvania have had an opportunity of exercising. For although a few individuals who were in the General Convention may have given it a sufficient degree of investigation to satisfy their own minds; yet it may be fairly said of the people at large, that they could not possibly have given it a due degree of examination at the time that they were in a manner surprised into a kind of surrender of the right of further deliberation, by the election of delegates to express their final decision. It has been said that a small proportion only of the voters in the state (hardly a sixth part) gave their suffrages on this occasion;3 and it may fairly be presumed, circumstances considered, that a large proportion of those who did not vote declined it because they found themselves unqualified from the mere want of such information as every citizen ought to possess before he gives his weight on either side, on a question of so much importance. Will the members of the state Convention, thus possessed of the power, run hastily into the adoption, in toto, of a plan of government which, in the opinion of a large proportion of their constituents, cannot with safety be put in operation without very essential amendments? Or will they not rather assent either to make the necessary amendments the condition of their agreeing to the plan; or to adjourn for a reasonable time, in order to obtain the deliberate sense of their constituents on a matter of so much importance? Those who mean to act fairly can hardly withhold their assent to such an adjournment, except it be on the score of expense and the trouble of reassembling; but surely these are considerations too light to be placed in opposition to the object. The delay can occasion no real loss of time as to the final event, because the accession of other states will be necessary to give operation to the plan; and we know that divers of the state conventions will not meet to deliberate upon it before May or June. Why then should we be denied a reasonable time for deliberation? If the system be a good one and calculated to promote the happiness of the people, the more it is examined and understood, the more generally will it be approved of; but if it should be otherwise, it can hardly be expected that the people would acquiesce in a determination which they might suppose had been unfairly obtained."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,12/12/1787,"I Samuel iii [viii]. 18.�And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your king which ye shall have chosen you: and the Lord will not hear you in that day. My Fellow-Citizens, I do not write to inflame your minds, but to inform them. I do not write with a view to excite jealousies, and exhibit imaginary evils, but to promote your peace: I have no intentions of encouraging you to oppose or alter your present free government; but on the contrary, I advise you, yea, I entreat you, not to change it for one that is worse: if you cannot procure a better, why, be doing with the old bad one. Except you are tired of freedom; except you are determined to entail slavery on yourselves and your posterity, for God�s sake reject with that dignity becoming freemen, that tyrannical system of government, the new constitution. If you adopt it in toto, you will lose every thing dear to freemen, and receive nothing in return but misery and disgrace. Were some additional powers for regulating commerce, and the impost duties for a limited time, granted to the present Congress; this would probably answer all our purposes: but before Congress should be vested with greater powers than they now have, their number ought at least to be tripled-suppose two hundred and sixty; that is, twenty members for each state. But this matter I shall leave for the discussion of our next federal convention; if we should have the good luck to see their high mightinesses once more locked up in the State-house, guarded by captain M�Clean�s old battle-ax battalion. Among the schemes and collusions that the friends of the new constitution have made use of to dupe the people into its adoption, that of making them believe that such a government would raise America to an eminent rank among the nations of the earth, seems to have been one [419]of the most successful.�There is not a writer that I have seen on the subject, that has called the truth of this matter into question; no wonder then, that the less informed should be imposed upon; when men of more enlightened understandings seem even to have swallowed the bait. No people in the world have more of the genuine amor patri�, than the citizens of the United States; that noble ambition, that laudable love for the dignity and character of his country, is so implanted in the breast of an American, that he is willing not only to contribute generously and largely of his property, but likewise to expend his blood to support that government that should establish the national respectability of his country.�This truly grand principle is so copiously infused into the hearts of our countrymen, that, I really believe, there is scarce an inconvenience to which they would not cheerfully submit, provided this great point could be obtained. On this account then there are many who, although they are thoroughly persuaded, that the new constitution is defective in many striking and material instances, yet, through their national pride, would magnanimously overlook these, to have their country on a respectable footing as a nation. But ah, my fellow citizens, you are even disappointed here! It is a mere delusion! nothing but the basest deception; for, in the adoption of this constitution, we will probably lose that small portion of national character which we now enjoy, instead of gaining an accession to it. What compensation then are you to receive in return for the liberties and privileges belonging to yourselves and posterity, that you are now about to sacrifice at the altar of this monster, this Colossus of despotism. Why really the return you deserve, if you are mean enough to submit to be gulled after this manner, is poverty, slavery and broken hearts.�But probably, you will say, these are groundless conjectures, and we are perfectly convinced, that our new government, however it may be imperfect in some matters of an inferior nature, yet it must and will be powerful; yea, a government that will make its enemies tremble. If you mean by its enemies the helpless widow and orphan, the hard working husbandman, sunk down by labour and poverty, I grant it; but if you mean a foreign enemy, you insult your understanding. No, my friends, instead of becoming formidable, we will be the scorn and contempt of the whole world during the existence of this contemptible government. Let us take but a rational view of its strength and respectability, and then we shall see that we have really nothing to depend on in this new constitution, that can raise the national character of America, but on the contrary, we will sink into a state of insignificance and misery. The number of inhabitants in the United States is now probably about three millions and an half.�These are scattered over a continent [420]twelve hundred miles long and eight hundred broad. Now to keep such an extensive country in subjection to one general government, a standing army by far too numerous for such a small number of people to maintain, must and will be garrisoned in every district through the whole; and in case of emergency, the collecting of these scattered troops into one large body, to act against a foreign enemy, will be morally impossible. Besides they will have too much business on hand at their respective garrisons, in awing the people, to be spared for other purposes. There is no doubt, but to carry the arbitrary decrees of the federal judges into execution, and to protect the tax gatherers in collecting the revenue, will be ample employment for the military; indeed with all their strength and numbers, I am afraid, that they will find this a job of some difficulty, perhaps more than they will get through decently. Upon the whole I think it is pretty obvious, that our standing army will have other fish to fry than fighting a foreign enemy; there is work enough cut out for them of a domestic nature, without troubling them on other occasions. Moreover, such of them as might be brought into action, could not be depended upon; for they will principally consist of the purgings of the European prisons, and low ruffians bred among ourselves who do not love to work.�And who could suppose that such vile characters as these, should be trusted to protect our country, our wives, our daughters, and our little ones? No, my friends, God deliver us from such protectors!�Their mean souls wanting that amor patri�, that love of virtue, that noble love for the welfare and happiness of their fellow men, which animates the man of courage, and constitutes him the soldier, would fail them at the approach of an enemy; yea, they would either fly ere the battle commenced, or submit on the first charge; and probably turn their arms against the country that expected their protection. What I advance here, are truths, founded on reason and the nature of things, and the experience of all ages affords ample examples for their illustration. Very little need be said respecting the militia defending the country; perhaps what I have advanced in my last essay,2 is enough on that head; indeed the thing itself carries its own evidence along with it. A person that has judgment sufficient to compare two ideas together, must see, that an oppressed people, reduced to a state of abject vassalage, by a despotic government, will never voluntarily venture their lives for it. When people are once slaves, it is a matter of little concern to them who are their masters.�The fable of the sensible ass is so pertinent to our purpose, that I cannot forbear reciting it:��An old fellow was feeding an ass in a fine green meadow, and being alarmed by the sudden approach of the enemy, was impatient with the ass to put himself forward, and fly with all the speed he was able. The ass asked him, whether [421]or no he thought the enemy would clap two pair of panniers upon his back? The man said, no, there was no fear of that. Why then, says the ass, I�ll not stir an inch, for what is it to me who my master is, since I shall but carry my panniers as usual.� There is not the most distant hope, that we shall ever have a navy under this constitution which annihilates the state governments; for, if each state were to retain its sovereignty, I am well convinced, that we might have a considerable fleet in a few years; the larger states might each build a ship of the line every year, and the lesser states would furnish us with frigates; a noble emulation among the states would be the consequence, one state would vie with another, and public spirited individuals would contribute generously to raise the character of their own state. But this consolidation of all the states into one general government, renders this project impossible; the federal government having an unlimited power in taxation, which, no doubt, they will exercise to the utmost; leaves the states without the means of building even a boat. But had they money, they dare not use it for that purpose, for, Congress are to have an absolute power over the standing army, navy, and militia; so that it is out of the question, whether a particular state be, or be not, able to build a ship of war; she must meddle with no such matter; it only belongs to the emperor and our well born Congress to build and maintain a navy. Now, if we give ourselves time to think but for a moment, we must be convinced in our minds, that Congress having a large national debt already accumulated, the emperor, themselves, their judges, lawyers, revenue-collectors, dependants, flatterers, &c. &c. and above all, the standing army, at least double officered, to provide for, will find themselves at their wit�s end, to devise ways and means for all these purposes. In short, the industry of three millions of people, were it all applied to this use, would be little enough.�Where then will the navy come from? Where will Congress find money even to build and maintain cutters to prevent smuggling on the extensive coast of America? No where, truly: such a supposition is farcical indeed; and should the new constitution be established, a federal navy is a mere finesse, an absolute nonentity. The Congress must procure money to pay the standing army punctually, come of other matters what will; their very existence depends on this. For a neglect of payment might and really would cause a mutiny in the military, and then, down tumbles the federal constitution, whose mighty basis was said to be at the centre of the earth. The standing army will be its grand support-now, if this give way, the building itself will be instantly levelled to the ground. And heaven grant that Columbia may never see such another erected again on her domain. Amen,"
Newspaper,No,Alfred,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/13/1787,"To the real Patriots of America. The history of mankind teacheth us how sudden and easy the transition is from liberty to a state of slavery. The Romans, the bravest people the world ever saw, after all their struggles and contentions, found themselves under the absolute direction of a Nero, a Caligula, a Tiberius, and a Domitian. Governments, as they are the workmanship of man, so they partake of the, changeableness of his nature; but the changes which happen, have been more frequently from liberty to slavery, than from slavery to liberty. When once a community are fast bound in chains and in misery, there must be great efforts, and the effusion of much blood, to liberate them from their wretched condition. America is now free-she now enjoys a greater portion of political liberty than any other country under heaven. How long she may continue so, depends entirely upon her own caution and wisdom. If she would look to herself more, and to Europe less, I am persuaded, it would tend to promote her felicity. She possesses all the advantages which characterize a rich country:–rich within herself, she ought the less to regard the politics, the manufactures, and the interests of distant nations. When I look to our situation, climate, extent, soil, and its productions, rivers and ports; when I find I can at this time purchase grain, bread, meat, and other necessaries of life, at as reasonable a rate as in any country; when I see, we are sending great quantities of tobacco, [433]wheat and flour to England and other parts of the globe, beyond the Atlantic; when I get on the other side of the western mountains, and see an extensive country, which, for its multitude of rivers and fertility of soil, is equal, if not superior, to any other whatever; when I see these things, I cannot be brought to believe that America is in that deplorable, ruined condition which some designing politicians represent; or that we are in a state of anarchy beyond redemption, unless we adopt, without any addition or amendment, the new constitution proposed by the late Convention; a constitution which, in my humble opinion, contains the seeds and scions of slavery and despotism. When the volume of American constitutions first made its appearance in Europe,2 we find some of the most eminent political writers of the present age, and the reviewers of literature, full of admiration, and declaring they had never before seen so much good sense, freedom, and real wisdom in one publication. Our good friend Doctor Price was charmed, and almost prophesied the near approach of the happy days of the millenium. We have lived under these constitutions; and, after the experience of a few years, some among us are ready to trample them under their feet, though they have been esteemed, even by our enemies, as “pearls of great price.” Let us not, ye lovers of freedom, be rash and hasty–Perhaps the real evils we labor under, do not arise from these systems–There may be many other causes, to which our misfortunes may be properly attributed–Read the American constitutions, and you will find our essential rights and privileges well guarded and secured. May not our manners be the source of our national evils? May not our attachment to foreign trade increase them? Have we not acted imprudently in exporting almost all our gold and silver for foreign luxuries? It is now acknowledged that we have not a sufficient quantity of the precious metals to answer the various purposes of government and commerce; and without a breach of charity, it may be said that this deficiency arises from the want of public virtue, in prefering private interest to every other consideration. If the states had in any tolerable degree been able to answer the requisitions of Congress; if the continental treasury had been so far assisted, as to have enabled us to pay the interest of our foreign debt, possibly we should have heard little, very little about a new system of government. It is a just observation that in modern times, money does every thing. If a government can command this unum necessarium from a certain revenue, it may be considered as wealthy and respectable; if not, it will lose its dignity, become inefficient and contemptible. But cannot we regulate our finances, and lay the foundations for a permanent, [434]certain revenue, without undoing all that we have done, without making an entire new government? The most wise and philosophic characters have bestowed on our old systems the highest encomiums. Are we sure this new political phenomenon will not fail? If it should fail, is there not a great probability, that our last state will be worse than the first? Orators may declaim on the badness of the times as long as they please, but I must tell them that the want of public virtue, and the want of money, are two of the principal sources of our present grievances; and if we are under the pressure of these wants, it ought to teach us frugality–to adopt a frugal administration of public affairs. It has been said that the civil list expences of the several states, have enormously exceeded what they formerly were prior to the late revolution. Will the new system, which really comprehends an imperium in imperils, be administered at a less expence, than we now experience? Can we create new offices without an accumulation of expences? Shall we enjoy a greater degree of political freedom and happiness under the proposed plan? If these and other advantages are not quite evident, we ought to be extremely cautious, how we change our condition. Systems may be very specious in theory; but fail us in practice. Government is a science which consists more in experience than in notional knowledge. What will suit the different manners, habits, and interests, of a wide extended country like America, can only be known by an experiment; and if that should fail, our liberties might fail with it. Cannot we be a number of confederated states, confederated for the purpose of defence and commerce, without erecting a fabric, more like an empire, than a republic? Empires are considered as despotic, and is there no danger of despotism in the establishment of one so great and complicated as the American will be? Most liberal authors would dissuade us from so great and dangerous an experiment,–I shall conclude at present, with a quotation from(a) one of them; “Vast empires are in many respects unnatural: but particularly in this, that be they ever so well constituted, the affairs of the many must, in such governments turn upon a few; and the relation be less sensible, and in a manner lost between the magistrate and people, in a body so unwieldy in its limbs, and whose members lie so remote from one another, and distant from the head. ’Tis in such bodies as these that strong factions are aptest to engender. The associating spirits, for want of exercise, form new movements, and seek a narrower sphere of activity, when they want action in a greater. Thus we have wheels within wheels, and in some national constitutions, notwithstanding the absurdity in politics, we have one empire within another.” (a) The Caracteristics.3"
Letter,Yes,A Gentleman in Philadelphia,Friend in Cecil County,,,12/14/1787,"I am very anxious to know how your state stands affected with regard to the new proposed Constitution. The political phrensy with which Pennsylvania was seized on its first appearance begins now sensibly to abate. The people get every day more and more information upon the subject; and I make no doubt, that if we had only a short respite of three months, the new Constitution would be entirely rejected; but matters have been carried on with such high-handed precipitation, that I am much afraid we shall pass the Rubicon, and that our eyes will not be fully opened until it is too late. The returns of members for the Convention that have come to hand are generally of an aristocratic complexion, and there will certainly be a majority of the�wellborn�party. Mr. [James] W[ilso]n and Dr. [Benjamin] R[us]h are returned for the city; their daring attempts to deceive the people, by the most insidious speeches, have been rewarded with trust and honors. Our friends have endeavored to carry the venerable Dr. Franklin, but he did not get more than 235 votes. Notwithstanding the great use that is made of his name to support the new system, it is very certain that he is far from approving of it. This the�wellborn�know, and it is the reason why they have left him out of the ticket. This great patriot is as much attached as ever to democratic principles, and every day brings forth some new instance of it. I shall relate one in particular which appears to me very striking. The aristocratics�being, for the first time, very strong in our Executive Council, had formed the noble design of turning out every officer of the�democratic�party. They began with Mr. [Peter] Wikoff, the city auctioneer, who had only been about three or four months in office, and who could not be charged with any fault except paying the state duties and his customers with the utmost punctuality.2�But they were most anxious to displace Jonathan Bayard Smith, Esquire, the prothonotary of this county, an excellent patriot, a Whig in the worst of times, and one who is avowedly opposed to the new Constitution; and no less a man than Mr. Wilson, was the candidate for his office. Yesterday the election came on, and the votes being taken, Council were equally divided, when Dr. Franklin, to the great mortification of the�Wilsonites, gave his casting vote in favor of Mr. Smith.3 Next Tuesday our Convention meets, and as I told you before, I am afraid they will adopt the new Constitution, as I am sure there is a majority of them who are predetermined in its favor. There will be, however, a very respectable minority, and among them, I am proud to name Messrs. [William] Findley, [Robert] Whitehill, and [John] Smiley, whose names, if I am not mistaken, will do an everlasting honor to Pennsylvania. Yet, I fear, those great patriots, notwithstanding all their exertions, will not be able on this occasion to stem the torrent of prejudice created by influence. You need not look up to Pennsylvania for your political salvation from the danger that threatens us all. As the other states have not acted with so much precipitation, it is by them that we expect to be saved from impending ruin. Here I am ready to exclaim with the great Shakespeare: Methinks our Country sinks beneath the Yoke. It weeps, it bleeds, and each new Day a Gash Is added to its Wounds.�Bleed!�bleed!�poor Country! Grim Tyranny erect thy Basis sure, For Goodness dares not check thee���.�Macbeth."

It was formed by some of the ablest patriots in America. It carried us successfully through the war; and the virtue and patriotism of the people, with their disposition to promote the common cause, supplied the want of power in Congress. The requisition of Congress for the five percent impost was made before the peace, so early as the first of February 1781,1 but was prevented taking effect by the refusal of one state; yet it is probable every state in the union would have agreed to this measure at that period had it not been for the extravagant terms in which it was demanded. The requisition was new molded in the year 1783, and accompanied with an additional demand of certain supplementary funds for 25 years.2 Peace had now taken place, and the United States found themselves laboring under a considerable foreign and domestic debt, incurred during the war. The requisition of 1783 was commensurate with the interest of the debt, as it was then calculated; but it has been more accurately ascertained since that time. The domestic debt has been found to fall several millions of dollars short of the calculation, and it has lately been considerably diminished by large sales of the western lands. The states have been called on by Congress annually for supplies until the general system of finance proposed in 1783 should take place. It was at this time that the want of an efficient federal government was first complained of, and that the powers vested in Congress were found to be inadequate to the procuring of the benefits that should result from the union. The impost was granted by most of the states, but many refused the supplementary funds; the annual requisitions [619]were set at naught by some of the states, while others complied with them by legislative acts, but were tardy in their payments, and Congress found themselves incapable of complying with their engagements, and supporting the federal government. It was found that our national character was sinking in the opinion of foreign nations. The Congress could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the observance of them. We were suffering from the restrictions of foreign nations, who had shackled our commerce, while we were unable to retaliate; and all now agreed that it would be advantageous to the union to enlarge the powers of Congress; that they should be enabled in the amplest manner to regulate commerce, and to lay and collect duties on the imports throughout the United States. With this view a convention was first proposed by Virginia,3 and finally recommended by Congress for the different states to appoint deputies to meet in convention, �for the purposes of revising and amending the present articles of confederation, so as to make them adequate to the exigencies of the union.�4 This recommendation the legislatures of twelve states complied with so hastily as not to consult their constituents on the subject; and though the different legislatures had no authority from their constituents for the purpose, they probably apprehended the necessity would justify the measure; and none of them extended their ideas at that time further than �revising and amending the present articles of confederation.� Pennsylvania by the act appointing deputies expressly confined their powers to this object;5 and though it is probable that some of the members of the assembly of this state had at that time in contemplation to annihilate the present confederation, as well as the constitution of Pennsylvania, yet the plan was not sufficiently matured to communicate it to the public. The majority of the legislature of this commonwealth were at that time under the influence of the members from the city of Philadelphia. They agreed that the deputies sent by them to convention should have no compensation for their services, which determination was calculated to prevent the election of any member who resided at a distance from the city. It was in vain for the minority to attempt electing delegates to the convention, who understood the circumstances, and the feelings of the people, and had a common interest with them. They found a disposition in the leaders of the majority of the house to choose themselves and some of their dependents. The minority attempted to prevent this by agreeing to vote for some of the leading members, who they knew had influence enough to be appointed at any rate, in hopes of carrying with them some respectable citizens of Philadelphia, in whose principles and integrity they could have more confidence; but even in this they were disappointed, except in one [620]member [Jared Ingersoll]: the eighth member [Benjamin Franklin] was added at a subsequent session of the assembly.6 The Continental convention met in the city of Philadelphia at the time appointed. It was composed of some men of excellent characters; of others who were more remarkable for their ambition and cunning, than their patriotism; and of some who had been opponents to the independence of the United States. The delegates from Pennsylvania were, six of them, uniform and decided opponents to the constitution of this commonwealth. The convention sat upwards of four months. The doors were kept shut, and the members brought under the most solemn engagements of secrecy.(a) Some of those who opposed their going so far beyond their powers retired, hopeless, from the convention, others had the firmness to refuse signing the plan altogether; and many who did sign it, did it not as a system they wholly approved, but as the best that could be then obtained, and notwithstanding the time spent on this subject, it is agreed on all hands to be a work of haste and accommodation. Whilst the gilded chains were forging in the secret conclave, the meaner instruments of despotism without were busily employed in alarming the fears of the people with dangers which did not exist, and exciting their hopes of greater advantages from the expected plan than even the best government on earth could produce. The proposed plan had not many hours issued forth from the womb of suspicious secrecy, until such as were prepared for the purpose were carrying about petitions for people to sign, signifying their approbation of the system, and requesting the legislature to call a convention. While every measure was taken to intimidate the people against opposing it, the public papers teemed with the most violent threats against those who should dare to think for themselves, and tar and feathers7 were liberally promised to all those who would not immediately join in supporting the proposed government be it what it would. Under such circumstances petitions in favor of calling a convention were signed by great numbers in and about the city, before they had leisure to read and examine the system, many of whom, now they are better acquainted with it, and have had time to investigate its principles, are heartily opposed to it. The petitions were speedily handed into the legislature.8 Affairs were in this situation when on the 28th of September last, a resolution was proposed to the assembly by a member [George Clymer] of the house who had been also a member of the federal convention, for calling a state convention, to be elected within ten days for the purpose of examining and adopting the proposed constitution of [621]the United States, though at this time the house had not received it from Congress. This attempt was opposed by a minority, who after offering every argument in their power to prevent the precipitate measure, without effect, absented themselves from the house as the only alternative left them, to prevent the measure taking place previous to their constituents being acquainted with the business. That violence and outrage which had been so often threatened was now practiced; some of the members were seized the next day by a mob collected for the purpose, and forcibly dragged to the house, and there detained by force whilst the quorum of the legislature, so formed, completed their resolution. We shall dwell no longer on this subject, the people of Pennsylvania have been already acquainted therewith. We would only further observe that every member of the legislature, previously to taking his seat, by solemn oath or affirmation, declares, �that he will not do or consent to any act or thing whatever that shall have a tendency to lessen or abridge their rights and privileges, as declared in the constitution of this state.� And that constitution which they are so solemnly sworn to support cannot legally be altered but by a recommendation of the council of censors, who alone are authorized to propose alterations and amendments, and even these must be published at least six months, for the consideration of the people. The proposed system of government for the United States, if adopted, will alter and may annihilate the constitution of Pennsylvania; and therefore the legislature had no authority whatever to recommend the calling a convention for that purpose. This proceeding could not be considered as binding on the people of this commonwealth. The house was formed by violence, some of the members composing it were detained there by force, which alone would have vitiated any proceedings, to which they were otherwise competent; but had the legislature been legally formed, this business was absolutely without their power. In this situation of affairs were the subscribers elected members of the convention of Pennsylvania. A convention called by a legislature in direct violation of their duty, and composed in part of members, who were compelled to attend for that purpose, to consider of a constitution proposed by a convention of the United States, who were not appointed for the purpose of framing a new form of government, but whose powers were expressly confined to altering and amending the present articles of confederation. Therefore the members of the continental convention in proposing the plan acted as individuals, and not as deputies from Pennsylvania.(b) The assembly who called the state convention acted as individuals, and not as the legislature of Pennsylvania; nor could they or the convention chosen on their recommendation [622]have authority to do any act or thing, that can alter or annihilate the constitution of Pennsylvania (both of which will be done by the new constitution) nor are their proceedings in our opinion, at all binding on the people. The election for members of the convention was held at so early a period and the want of information was so great, that some of us did not know of it until after it was over, and we have reason to believe that great numbers of the people of Pennsylvania have not yet had an opportunity of sufficiently examining the proposed constitution. We apprehend that no change can take place that will affect the internal government or constitution of this commonwealth, unless a majority of the people should evidence a wish for such a change; but on examining the number of votes given for members of the present state convention, we find that of upwards of seventy thousand freemen who are entitled to vote in Pennsylvania, the whole convention has been elected by about thirteen thousand voters, and though two-thirds of the members of the convention have thought proper to ratify the proposed constitution, yet those two-thirds were elected by the votes of only six thousand and eight hundred freemen. In the city of Philadelphia and some of the eastern counties, the junto that took the lead in the business agreed to vote for none but such as would solemnly promise to adopt the system in toto, without exercising their judgment. In many of the counties the people did not attend the elections as they had not an opportunity of judging of the plan. Others did not consider themselves bound by the call of a set of men who assembled at the state house in Philadelphia, and assumed the name of the legislature of Pennsylvania; and some were prevented from voting by the violence of the party who were determined at all events to force down the measure.9 To such lengths did the tools of despotism carry their outrage, that in the night of the election for members of convention, in the city of Philadelphia, several of the subscribers (being then in the city to transact your business) were grossly abused, ill-treated and insulted while they were quiet in their lodgings, though they did not interfere, nor had anything to do with the said election, but, as they apprehend, because they were supposed to be adverse to the proposed constitution, and would not tamely surrender those sacred rights, which you had committed to their charge.10 The convention met, and the same disposition was soon manifested in considering the proposed constitution, that had been exhibited in every other stage of the business. We were prohibited by an express vote of the convention, from taking any question on the separate [623]articles of the plan, and reduced to the necessity of adopting or rejecting in toto. Tis true the majority permitted us to debate on each article, but restrained us from proposing amendments. They also determined not to permit us to enter on the minutes our reasons of dissent against any of the articles, nor even on the final question our reasons of dissent against the whole. Thus situated we entered on the examination of the proposed system of government, and found it to be such as we could not adopt, without, as we conceived, surrendering up your dearest rights. We offered our objections to the convention, and opposed those parts of the plan, which, in our opinion, would be injurious to you, in the best manner we were able; and closed our arguments by offering the following propositions to the convention. 1. The right of conscience shall be held inviolable; and neither the legislative, executive, nor judicial powers of the United States shall have authority to alter, abrogate, or infringe any part of the constitution of the several states, which provide for the preservation of liberty in matters of religion. 2. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, trial by jury shall remain as heretofore, as well in the federal courts, as in those of the several states. 3. That in all capital and criminal prosecutions, a man has a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, as well in the federal courts, as in those of the several states; to be heard by himself and his counsel; to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses; to call for evidence in his favor, and a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent, he cannot be found guilty, nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself; and that no man be deprived of his liberty, except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers. 4. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel nor unusual punishments inflicted. 5. That warrants unsupported by evidence, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons, his or their property, not particularly described, are grievous and oppressive, and shall not be granted either by the magistrates of the federal government or others. 6. That the people have a right to the freedom of speech, of writing and publishing their sentiments, therefore, the freedom of the press shall not be restrained by any law of the United States. 7. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose [624]of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed, or real danger of public injury from individuals; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military shall be kept under strict subordination to and be governed by the civil powers. 8. The inhabitants of the several states shall have liberty to fowl and hunt in seasonable times, on the lands they hold, and on all other lands in the United States not enclosed, and in like manner to fish in all navigable waters, and others not private property, without being restrained therein by any laws to be passed by the legislature of the United States. 9. That no law shall be passed to restrain the legislatures of the several states from enacting laws for imposing taxes, except imposts and duties on goods imported or exported, and that no taxes, except imposts and duties upon goods imported and exported, and postage on letters shall be levied by the authority of Congress. 10. That the house of representatives be properly increased in number; that elections shall remain free; that the several states shall have power to regulate the elections for senators and representatives, without being controlled either directly or indirectly by an interference on the part of the Congress; and that elections of representatives be annual. 11. That the power of organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia (the manner of disciplining the militia to be prescribed by Congress) remain with the individual states, and that Congress shall not have authority to call or march any of the militia out of their own state, without the consent of such state, and for such length of time only as such state shall agree. That the sovereignty, freedom, and independency of the several states shall be retained, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this constitution expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. 12. That the legislative, executive, and judicial powers be kept separate; and to this end that a constitutional council be appointed, to advise and assist the president, who shall be responsible for the advice they give, hereby the senators would be relieved from almost constant attendance; and also that the judges be made completely independent. 13. That no treaty which shall be directly opposed to the existing laws of the United States in Congress assembled shall be valid until such laws shall be repealed, or made conformable to such treaty; neither shall any treaties be valid which are in contradiction to the [625]constitution of the United States, or the constitutions of the several states. 14. That the judiciary power of the United States shall be confined to cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states�between a state and citizens of different states�between citizens claiming lands under grants of different states; and between a state or the citizens thereof and foreign states, and in criminal cases, to such only as are expressly enumerated in the constitution, and that the United States in Congress assembled shall not have power to enact laws, which shall alter the laws of descents and distribution of the effects of deceased persons, the titles of lands or goods, or the regulation of contracts in the individual states. After reading these propositions, we declared our willingness to agree to the plan, provided it was so amended as to meet those propositions, or something similar to them; and finally moved the convention to adjourn, to give the people of Pennsylvania time to consider the subject, and determine for themselves; but these were all rejected, and the final vote was taken, when our duty to you induced us to vote against the proposed plan, and to decline signing the ratification of the same. During the discussion we met with many insults, and some personal abuse; we were not even treated with decency, during the sitting of the convention, by the persons in the gallery of the house; however, we flatter ourselves that in contending for the preservation of those invaluable rights you have thought proper to commit to our charge, we acted with a spirit becoming freemen, and being desirous that you might know the principles which actuated our conduct, and being prohibited from inserting our reasons of dissent on the minutes of the convention, we have subjoined them for your consideration, as to you alone we are accountable. It remains with you whether you will think those inestimable privileges, which you have so ably contended for, should be sacrificed at the shrine of despotism, or whether you mean to contend for them with the same spirit that has so often baffled the attempts of an aristocratic faction, to rivet the shackles of slavery on you and your unborn posterity. Our objections are comprised under three general heads of dissent, viz.: We dissent, first, because it is the opinion of the most celebrated writers on government, and confirmed by uniform experience, that a very extensive territory cannot be governed on the principles of freedom, [626]otherwise than by a confederation of republics, possessing all the powers of internal government; but united in the management of their general, and foreign concerns. If any doubt could have been entertained of the truth of the foregoing principle, it has been fully removed by the concession of Mr. [James] Wilson, one of majority on this question; and who was one of the deputies in the late general convention. In justice to him, we will give his own words; they are as follows, viz.:11 �The extent of country for which the new constitution was required produced another difficulty in the business of the federal convention. It is the opinion of some celebrated writers that to a small territory, the democratical; to a middling territory (as Montesquieu has termed it) the monarchical; and to an extensive territory, the despotic form of government is best adapted. Regarding then the wide and almost unbounded jurisdiction of the United States, at first view, the hand of despotism seemed necessary to control, connect, and protect it; and hence the chief embarrassment rose. For, we know that, altho our constituents would cheerfully submit to the legislative restraints of a free government, they would spurn at every attempt to shackle them with despotic power.� And again in another part of his speech he continues. �Is it probable that the dissolution of the state governments and the establishment of one consolidated empire would be eligible in its nature and satisfactory to the people in its administration? I think not, as I have given reasons to show that so extensive a territory could not be governed, connected, and preserved, but by the supremacy of despotic power. All the exertions of the most potent emperors of Rome were not capable to keeping that empire together, which in extent was far inferior to the dominion of America.� We dissent, secondly, because the powers vested in Congress by this constitution must necessarily annihilate and absorb the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the several states, and produce from their ruins one consolidated government, which from the nature of things will be an iron-handed despotism, as nothing short of the supremacy of despotic sway could connect and govern these United States under one government. As the truth of this position is of such decisive importance, it ought to be fully investigated, and if it is founded to be clearly ascertained; for, should it be demonstrated, that the powers vested by this constitution in Congress will have such an effect as necessarily to produce one consolidated government, the question then will be reduced to this short issue, viz.: whether satiated with the blessings of liberty; whether repenting of the folly of so recently asserting their unalienable rights, against foreign despots at the expense of so much [627]blood and treasure, and such painful and arduous struggles, the people of America are now willing to resign every privilege of freemen, and submit to the dominion of an absolute government, that will embrace all America in one chain of despotism; or whether they will with virtuous indignation spurn at the shackles prepared for them, and confirm their liberties by a conduct becoming freemen. That the new government will not be a confederacy of states, as it ought, but one consolidated government founded upon the destruction of the several governments of the states, we shall now show. The powers of Congress under the new constitution are complete and unlimited over the purse and the sword, and are perfectly independent of, and supreme over, the state governments; whose intervention in these great points is entirely destroyed. By virtue of their power of taxation, Congress may command the whole, or any part of the property of the people. They may impose what imposts upon commerce; they may impose what land taxes, poll taxes, excises, duties on all written instruments, and duties on every other article that they may judge proper; in short, every species of taxation, whether of an external or internal nature is comprised in section the 8th, of Article the 1st, viz.: �The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.� As there is no one article of taxation reserved to the state governments, the Congress may monopolize every source of revenue, and thus indirectly demolish the state governments, for without funds they could not exist. The taxes, duties, and excises imposed by Congress may be so high as to render it impracticable to levy further sums on the same articles; but whether this should be the case or not, if the state governments should presume to impose taxes, duties, or excises, on the same articles with Congress, the latter may abrogate and repeal the laws whereby they are imposed, upon the allegation that they interfere with the due collection of their taxes, duties, or excises, by virtue of the following clause, part of section 8th, Article 1st, viz.: �To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.� The Congress might gloss over this conduct by construing every purpose for which the state legislatures now lay taxes, to be for the �general welfare,� and therefore as of their jurisdiction. And the supremacy of the laws of the United States is established by Article 6th, viz.: �That this constitution and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, [628]or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.� It has been alleged that the words �pursuant to the constitution� are a restriction upon the authority of Congress; but when it is considered that by other sections they are invested with every efficient power of government, and which may be exercised to the absolute destruction of the state governments, without any violation of even the forms of the constitution, this seeming restriction, as well as every other restriction in it, appears to us to be nugatory and delusive; and only introduced as a blind upon the real nature of the government. In our opinion, �pursuant to the constitution� will be coextensive with the will and pleasure of Congress, which, indeed, will be the only limitation of their powers. We apprehend that two coordinate sovereignties would be a solecism in politics. That therefore as there is no line of distinction drawn between the general and state governments; as the sphere of their jurisdiction is undefined, it would be contrary to the nature of things, that both should exist together, one or the other would necessarily triumph in the fullness of dominion. However the contest could not be of long continuance, as the state governments are divested of every means of defense, and will be obliged by �the supreme law of the land� to yield at discretion. It has been objected to this total destruction of the state governments, that the existence of their legislatures is made essential to the organization of Congress; that they must assemble for the appointment of the senators and president general of the United States. True, the state legislatures may be continued for some years, as boards of appointment, merely, after they are divested of every other function, but the framers of the constitution foreseeing that the people will soon be disgusted with this solemn mockery of a government without power and usefulness have made a provision for relieving them from the imposition, in section 4th, of Article 1st, viz.: �The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time, by law make or alter such regulations; except as to the place of chusing senators.� As Congress have the control over the time of the appointment of the president general, of the senators and of the representatives of the United States, they may prolong their existence in office, for life, by postponing the time of their election and appointment, from period to period, under various pretenses, such as an apprehension of invasion, [629]the factious disposition of the people, or any other plausible pretense that the occasion may suggest; and having thus obtained life estates in the government, they may fill up the vacancies themselves, by their control over the mode of appointment; with this exception in regard to the senators, that as the place of appointment for them must, by the constitution, be in the particular state, they may depute somebody in the respective states, to fill up the vacancies in the senate occasioned by death, until they can venture to assume it themselves. In this manner may the only restriction in this clause be evaded. By virtue of the foregoing section, when the spirit of the people shall be gradually broken; when the general government shall be firmly established, and when a numerous standing army shall render opposition vain, the Congress may complete the system of despotism, in renouncing all dependence on the people, by continuing themselves, and [their] children in the government. The celebrated Montesquieu, in his Spirit of Laws, vol. 1, page 12th, says, �That in a democracy there can be no exercise of sovereignty, but by the suffrages of the people, which are their will; now the sovereign�s will is the sovereign himself; the laws therefore, which establish the right of suffrage, are fundamental to this government. In fact, it is as important to regulate in a republic in what manner, by whom, and concerning what suffrages are to be given, as it is in a monarchy to know who is the prince, and after what manner he ought to govern.� The time, mode, and place of the election of representatives, senators and president general of the United States ought not to be under the control of Congress, but fundamentally ascertained and established. The new constitution, consistently with the plan of consolidation, contains no reservation of the rights and privileges of the state governments, which was made in the confederation of the year 1778, by Article the 2d, viz.: �That each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.� The legislative power vested in Congress by the foregoing recited sections is so unlimited in its nature; may be so comprehensive, and boundless its exercise, that this alone would be amply sufficient to annihilate the state governments, and swallow them up in the grand vortex of general empire. The judicial powers vested in Congress are also so various and extensive, that by legal ingenuity they may be extended to every case, and thus absorb the state judiciaries, and when we consider the decisive influence that a general judiciary would have over the civil polity [630]of the several states, we do not hesitate to pronounce that this power, unaided by the legislative, would effect a consolidation of the states under one government. The powers of a court of equity, vested by this constitution in the tribunals of Congress; powers which do not exist in Pennsylvania unless so far as they can be incorporated with jury trial, would, in this state, greatly contribute to this event. The rich and wealthy suitors would eagerly lay hold of the infinite mazes, perplexities and delays, which a court of chancery, with the appellate powers of the supreme court in fact as well as law would furnish him with, and thus the poor man being plunged in the bottomless pit of legal discussion, would drop his demand in despair. In short, consolidation pervades the whole constitution. It begins with an annunciation that such was the intention. The main pillars of the fabric correspond with it, and the concluding paragraph is a confirmation of it -- The preamble begins with the words, We the people of the United States, which is the style of a compact between individuals entering into a state of society, and not that of a confederation of states. The other features of consolidation, we have before noticed. Thus we have fully established the position, that the powers vested by this constitution in Congress, will effect a consolidation of the states under one government, which even the advocates of this constitution admit, could not be done, without the sacrifice of all liberty. 3. We dissent, Thirdly, Because if it were practicable to govern so extensive a territory as these United States, includes, on the plan of a consolidated government, consistent with the principles of liberty and the happiness of the people, yet the construction of this constitution is not calculated to attain the object, for independent of the nature of the case, it would of itself, necessarily, produce a despotism, and that not by the usual gradations, but with the celerity that has hitherto only attended revolutions affected by the sword. To establish the truth of this position, a cursory investigation of the principles and form of this constitution will suffice. The first consideration that this review suggests, is the omission of a BILL OF RIGHTS, ascertaining and fundamentally establishing those unalienable and personal rights of men, without the full, free and secure enjoyment of which there can be no liberty, and over which it is not necessary for a good government to have the control. The principal of which are the rights of conscience, personal liberty by the clear and unequivocal establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, jury trial in criminal and civil cases, by an impartial jury of the vicinage or county, with the common law proceedings, for the safety of the accused in criminal prosecutions; and the liberty of the press, that scourge of tyrants, and the grand bulwark of every other liberty and privilege: the stipulations heretofore made in favor of them in the state constitutions, are entirely superceded by this constitution. The legislature of a free country should be so formed as to have a competent knowledge of its constituents, and enjoy their confidence. -- To produce these essential requisites, the representation ought to be fair, equal and sufficiently numerous, to possess the same interests, feelings, opinions and views, which the people themselves would possess, were they all assembled; and so numerous as to prevent bribery and undue influence, and so responsible to the people, by frequent and fair elections, as to prevent their neglecting, or sacrificing the views and interests of their constituents, to their own pursuits. We will now bring the legislature under this constitution to the test of the foregoing principles, which will demonstrate, that it is deficient in every essential quality of a just and safe representation. The house of representatives is to consist of 65 members; that is one for every 50,000 inhabitants, to be chosen every two years. Thirty-three members will form a quorum for doing business, and seventeen of these, being the majority, determine the sense of the house. The senate, the other constituent branch of the legislature, consists of 26 members, being two from each state, appointed by their legislatures every six years -- fourteen senators make a quorum; the majority of whom, eight, determines the sense of that body: except in judging on impeachments, or in making treaties, or in expelling a member, when two thirds of the senators present, must concur. The president is to have the control over the enacting of laws, so far as to make the concurrence of two thirds of the representatives and senators present necessary, if he should object to the laws. Thus it appears, that the liberties, happiness, interests, and great concerns, of the whole United States, may be dependent upon the integrity, virtue, wisdom, and knowledge of 25 or 26 men. How inadequate and unsafe a representation! Inadequate, because the sense and views of 3 or 4 millions of people diffused over so extensive a territory, comprising such various climates, products, habits, interests, and opinions, can not be collected in so small a body; and besides, it is not a fair and equal representation of the people, even in proportion to its number, for the smallest state has as much weight in the senate as the largest, and from the smallest of the number to be chosen for both branches of the legislature; and from the mode of election and appointment; which is under the control of Congress; and from the nature of the thing, men of the most elevated rank in life, will alone be chosen. The other orders in the society, such as farmers, traders, and mechanics, who all ought to have a competent number of their best informed men in the legislature, will be totally unrepresented. The representation is unsafe, because in the exercise of such great powers and trusts, it is so exposed to corruption and undue influence, by the gift of the numerous places of honor and emolument, at the disposal of the executive; by the arts and address of the great and designing; and by direct bribery. The representation is moreover inadequate and unsafe, because of the long terms for which it is appointed, and the mode of its appointment, by which congress may not only control the choice of the people, but may so manage as to divest the people of this fundamental right, and become self-elected. The number of members in the house of representatives may be increased to one for every 30,000 inhabitants. But when we consider, that this cannot be done without the consent of the senate, who from their share in the legislative, in the executive, and judicial departments, and permanency of appointment, will be the great efficient body in this government, and whose weight and predominancy would be abridged by an increase of the representatives, we are persuaded that this is a circumstance that cannot be expected. On the contrary, the number of representatives will probably be continued at 65, although the population of the country may swell to treble what it now is; unless a revolution should effect a change. We have before noticed the judicial power as it would effect a consolidation of the states into one government; we will now examine it, as it would affect the liberties and welfare of the people, supporting such a government were practicable and proper. The judicial power, under the proposed constitution, is founded on the well-known principles of the civil law, by which the judge determines both on law and fact, and appeals are allowed from the inferior tribunals to the superior, upon the whole question; so that facts, as well as law, would be re-examined, and even new facts brought forward in the court of appeals; and to use the words of a very eminent Civilian, The cause is many times another thing before the court of appeals, than what it was at the time of the first sentence. That this mode of proceeding is the one which must be adopted under this constitution, is evident form the following circumstances; 1st. That the trial by jury; which is the grand characteristic of the common law is secured by the constitution, only in criminal cases. -- 2d. That the appeal from both law and fact is expressly established, which is utterly inconsistent with the principles of the common law, and trials by jury. The only mode in which an appeal from law and fact can be established, is by adopting the principles and practice of the civil law; unless the United States should be drawn into the absurdity of calling and swearing juries, merely, for the purpose of contradicting the verdicts, which would render juries contemptible and worse than useless. -- 3d. That the courts to be established would decide on all cases of law and equity, which is a well known characteristic of the civil law, and these courts would have cognisance not only of the laws of the United States and treaties, and of cases affecting ambassadors, but of all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, which last are matters belonging exclusively to the civil law, in every nation in Christendom. Not to enlarge upon the loss of the invaluable right of trial by an unbiased jury, so dear to every friend of liberty, the monstrous expense and inconveniences of the mode of proceedings to be adopted, are such, as will prove intolerable to the people of this country. The lengthy proceedings of the civil law courts in the chancery of England, and in the courts of Scotland and France, are such that few men of moderate fortune can endure the expense of; the poor man must therefore submit to the wealthy. Length of purse will too often prevail against right and justice. For instance, we are told by the learned judge Blackstone, that a question, only on the property of an ox, of the value of three guineas, originating under the civil law proceedings in Scotland, after many interlocutory orders and sentences below, was carried at length from the court of sessions, the highest court in that part of Great Britain, by way of appeal to the house of lords, where the question of law and fact was finally determined. He adds, that no pique or spirit, could in the court of king's bench or common pleas at Westminster, have given continuance to such a cause for a tenth part of the time, nor have cost a twentieth part of the expense. Yet the costs in the courts of king's bench and common pleas in England, are infinitely greater than those which the people of this country have ever experienced. We abhor the idea of losing the transcendent privilege of trial by jury, with the loss of which, it remarked by the same learned author, that in Sweden, the liberties of the commons were extinguished by an aristocratic senate; and that trial by jury and the liberty of the people went out together. At the same time we regret the intolerable delay, the enormous expenses and infinite vexation to which the people of this country will be exposed from the voluminous proceedings of the courts of civil law and especially from the appellate jurisdiction, by means of which a man may be drawn from the utmost boundaries of this extensive country to the seat of the supreme court of the nation to contend, perhaps, with a wealthy and powerful adversary. The consequence of this establishment will be an absolute confirmation of the power of aristocratical influence in the courts of justice; for the common people will not be able to contend or struggle against it. Trial by jury in criminal cases may also be excluded by declaring that the libeler for instance shall be liable to an action of debt for a specified sum; thus evading the common law prosecution by indictment and trial by jury. And the common course of proceeding against a ship for breach of revenue laws by information (which will be classed among civil causes,) will, at the civil law be within the resort of a court, where no jury intervenes. Besides, the benefit of jury trial, in cases of a criminal nature, which cannot be evaded, will be rendered of little value by calling the accused to answer far from home; there being no provision that the trial be by a jury of the neighborhood or country. Thus an inhabitant of Pittsburgh; on a charge of crime committed on the banks of the Ohio, may be obliged to defend himself at the side of the Delaware, and so vice versa. To conclude this head: We observe that the judges of the courts of Congress would not be independent, as they are not debarred from holding other offices, during the pleasure of the president and senate, and as they may derive their support in part from fees, alterable by the legislature. The next consideration that the constitution presents, is the undue and dangerous mixture of the powers of government; the same body a possessing legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The senate is a constituent branch of the legislature, it has judicial power in judging on impeachments, and in this case unites in some measure, the characters of judge and party, as all the principal officers are appointed by the president-general, with the concurrence of the senate, and therefore they derive their offices in part from the senate. This may bias the judgements of the senators and tend to screen great delinquents from punishment. And the senate has, moreover, various and great executive powers, viz. in concurrence with the president-general, they form treaties with foreign nations that may control and abrogate the constitutions and laws of the several states. Indeed, there is no power, privilege or liberty of the state governments, or of the people, but what may be affected by virtue of this power. For all treaties, made by them, are to be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding. And this great power may be exercised by the president and 10 senators, (being two-thirds of 14, which is a quorum of that body) what an inducement would this offer to the ministers of foreign powers to compass by bribery such concessions, as could not otherwise be obtained. It is the unvaried usage of all free states, whenever treaties interfere with the positive laws of the land, to make the intervention of the legislature necessary to give them operation. This became necessary and was afforded by the parliament of Great Britain, in consequence of the late commercial treaty between that kingdom and France. -- As the senate judges on impeachments, who is to try the members of the senate for the abuse of this power! And none of the great appointments to office can be made without the consent of the senate. Such various, extensive, and important powers combined in one body of men, are inconsistent with all freedom; the celebrated Montesquieu tells us, that when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or {Unreadable text} should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them [in?] a tyrannical manner. Again, there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated rom the legislative and executive powers. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject, would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would then be legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor. There would be an end of everything, were the same man, or the same body of the nobles, or of the people, to exercise these three powers; that of enacting laws; that of executing the public resolutions; and that of judging the crimes or differences of individuals. The president general is dangerously connected with the senate, his coincidence with the views of the ruling junto in that body, is made essential to his weight and importance in the government, which will destroy all independency and purity in the executive department, and having the power of pardoning without the concurrence of a council, he may screen from punishment the most treasonable attempts that may be made on the liberties of the people, when instigated by his coadjutors in the senate. Instead of this dangerous and improper mixture of the executive with the legislative and judicial, the supreme executive powers ought to have been placed in the president, with a small independent council, made personally responsible for every appointment to office, or other act, by having their opinions recorded; and that without the concurrence of the majority of the quorum of this council, the president should not be capable of taking any step. We have before considered internal taxation, as it would effect the destruction of the state governments, and produce on consolidated government. We will now consider that subject as it affects the personal concerns of the people. The power of direct taxation applies to every individual, as congress under this government is expressly vested with the authority of laying a capitation or poll-tax upon every person to any amount. This is a tax that, however oppressive in its nature, and unequal in its operation, is certain as to its produce and simple in it collection; it cannot be evaded like the objects of imposts or excise, and will be paid, because all that a man hath will he give for his head. This tax is so congenial to the nature of despotism, that it has ever been a favorite under such governments. Some of those who were in the late general convention from this state, have long labored to introduce a poll-tax among us. The power of direct taxation will further apply to every individual, as congress may tax land, cattle, trades, occupations, c. to any amount, and every object of internal taxation is of that nature, that however oppressive, the people will have but this alternative, either to pay the tax, or let their property be taken for all resistance will be vain. The standing army and select militia would enforce the collection. For the moderate exercise of this power, there is no control left in the state governments, whose intervention is destroyed. No relief, or redress of grievances can be extended, as heretofore by them. There is not even a declaration of RIGHTS to which the people may appeal for the vindication of their wrongs in the courts of justice. They must therefore, implicitly, obey the most arbitrary laws, as the worst of them, will be pursuant to the principles and form of the constitution, and that strongest of all checks upon the conduct of administration, responsibility to the people, will not exist in this government. The permanency of the appointments of senators and representatives, and the control the congress have over their election, will place them independent of the sentiments and resentment of the people, and the administration having a greater interest in the government than in the community, there will be no consideration to restrain them from oppression and tyranny. In the government of this state, under the old confederation, the members of the legislature are taken from among the people and their interests and welfare are so inseparably connected with those of their constituents, that they can derive no advantage from oppressive laws and taxes, for they would suffer in common with their fellow citizens; would participate in the burthens they impose on the community, as they must return to the common level, after a short period; and notwithstanding every exertion of influence, every means of corruption, a necessary rotation excludes them from permanency in the legislature. This large state is to have but ten members in that congress which is to have the liberty, property and dearest concerns of every individual of this vast country at absolute command; and ever these ten persons, who are to be our only guardians; who are to supercede the legislature of Pennsylvania, will not be of the choice of the people, nor amenable to them. From the mode of their election and appointment they will consist of the lordly and high-minded; of men who will have no congenial feelings with the people, but a perfect indifference for, and contempt of them, they will consist of those harpies of power, that prey upon the very vitals; that riot on the miseries of the community. But we will suppose, although in all probability it may never be realized in fact, that our deputies in congress have the welfare of their constituents at heart, and will exert themselves in their behalf, what security could even this afford; what relief could they extend to their oppressed constituents? To attain this, the majority of the deputies of the twelve other states in congress must be alike well disposed; must alike forego the sweets of power, and relinquish the pursuits of ambition, which from the nature of things is not to be expected. If the people part with a responsible representation in the legislature, founded upon fair, certain and frequent election, they have nothing left they can call their own. Miserable is the let of that people whose every concern depends on the WILL and PLEASURE of their rulers. Our soldiers will become Janissaries, and our officers of government Bashaws; in the short the system of despotism would soon be completed. From the foregoing investigation, it appears that the congress under this constitution, will not possess the confidence of the people, which is an essential requisite in a good government; for unless the laws command the confidence and respect of the great body of the people, so as to induce them to support them, when called on by the civil magistrate, they must be executed by the aid of a numerous standing army, which would be inconsistent with every idea of liberty; for the same force that may be employed to compel obedience to good laws, might and probably would be used to wrest from the people their constitutional liberties. The framers of this constitution appear to have been aware of this great deficiency; to have been sensible that no dependence could be placed on the people for their support: but on the contrary, that the government must be executed by force. They have therefore, made a provision for this purpose in a permanent STANDING ARMY, and a MILITIA that may be subjected to a strict discipline and government. A standing army in the hands of a government placed so independent of the people, may be made a fatal instrument to overturn the public liberties; it may be employed to enforce the collection of the most oppressive taxes, and to carry into execution the most arbitrary measures. An ambitious man who may have the army at his devotion, may step up into the throne, and seize upon absolute power. The absolute unqualified command that congress have over the militia may be made instrumental to the destruction of all liberty, both public and private; whether of a personal, civil, or religious nature. First, The personal liberty of every man probably from sixteen to sixty years of age, may be destroyed by the power congress have in organizing and governing of the militia. As militia they may be subjected to fines to any amount, levied in a military manner; they may be subjected to corporal punishments of the most disgraceful and humiliating kind, and to death itself by the sentence of a court martial: To this our young men will be more immediately subjected, as a select militia, composed of them, will best answer the purposes of government. Secondly, The rights of conscience maybe violated, as there is no exemption of those persons, who are conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. These compose a respectable proportion of the community in the state. This is the more remarkable, because even when the distresses of the late war, and the evident disaffection of many citizens of that description, inflamed our passions, and when every person, who was obliged to risque his own life, must have been exasperated, against such as on any account kept back from the common danger, yet even then, when outrage and violence might have been expected, the rights of conscience were held sacred. At this momentous crisis, the framers of our state constitution, made the most express and decided declaration and stipulations in favor of the rights of conscience: but now when no necessity exists, those dearest rights of men are left insecure. Thirdly, the absolute command of congress over the militia, may be destructive of public liberty; for under the guidance of an arbitrary government, they may be made the unwilling instruments of tyranny. The militia of Pennsylvania may be march to New-England or Virginia to quell an insurrection occasioned by the most galling oppression, and aided by the standing army, they will, no doubt, be successful in subduing their liberty and independency; but in so doing, although the magnanimity of their minds will be extinguished, yet the meaner passions of resentment and revenge will be increased, and those in turn will be the ready and obedient instruments of despotism to enslave the others; and that with an irritated vengeance. Thus may the militia be made the instruments of crushing the last efforts of expiring liberty, of riveting the chains of despotism on their fellow citizens and on one another. This power can be exercised not only without violating the constitution but in strict conformity with it, it is calculated for this express purpose, and will doubtless be executed accordingly. As this government will not enjoy the confidence of the people, but be executed by force, it will be a very expensive and burdensome government. The standing army must be numerous, and as a further support, it will be the policy of this government to multiply officers in every department; judges, collectors, tax-gathers, excisemen, and the whole host of revenue officers will swarm over the land, devouring the hard earnings of the industrious. Like the locusts of old, impoverishing and desolating all before them. We have not noticed the smaller, nor many of the considerable blemishes, but have confined our objections to the great and essential defects; the main pillars of the constitution; which we have shewn to be inconsistent with the liberty and happiness of the people, as its establishment will annihilate the state governments, and produce one consolidated government that will eventually and speedily issue in the supremacy of despotism. In this investigation, we have not confined our view to the interests or welfare of this state, in preference to the others. We have over looked all local circumstances -- we have considered this subject on the broad scale of the general good; we have asserted the cause of the present and future ages; the cause of liberty and mankind."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/19/1787,"�This is true liberty, when free born men Having to advise the public may speak free; Which he who can, and will, deserves high praise; Who neither can, nor will, may hold his peace;� What can be juster in a state than this?�1 My Fellow Citizens, If the arbitrary proceedings of the convention of Pennsylvania do not rouse your attention to the rights of yourselves and your children, there is nothing that I can say will do it. If the contempt and obloquy with which that body (whose legality even may be questioned) has treated your petitions, can not bring you to think seriously, what then will? When a few Demagogues despising every sense of order and decency, have rejected the petitions of the people, and in the most supercilious manner, triumphed over the freemen of America, as if they were their slaves, and they themselves their lords and masters. I say that if such barefaced presumption and arrogance, such tyrannical proceedings of the men, who, if acting constitutionally, were the servants of the people, be not sufficient to awaken you to a sense of your duty and interest, nothing less than the goad and the whip can succeed: your condition must be like that of the careless and insecure sinner, whom neither the admonitions nor entreaties of his friends, nor even the threatnings of awaiting justice, could reclaim or convince of his error; his reformation is neglected until it is too late, when he finds himself in a state of unutterable and endless woe. It may be asserted with confidence, that besides the petitions that Mr. Whitehill presented to the convention from Cumberland county against the adoption of the new constitution,2 there is not a county or town in the state that should not have followed the example, if a reasonable time had been allowed for the petitions to come in. Now if we consider but for a moment how contemptuously the people were [45]treated on this occasion, we may form some idea of the way in which they are hereafter to be governed by their well born masters. �The petitions being read from the chair. Mr. M�Kean said he was sorry that at this stage of the business so improper an attempt should be made; he hoped therefore that the petitions would not be attended to.� (Pennsylvania Herald.)3 Where is the freeman in America that can tamely suffer such an insult to his dignity to pass with impunity; where is that pusillanimous wretch who can submit to this contumely? Is not this the language of Britain, in the years 1775 and 1776, renewed. What said George the third and his pampered ministers, more than this, to the petitions of America? Is it improper for freemen to petition for their rights? If it be; then I say that the impropriety consisted only in their not demanding them. Propriety requires that the people should approach their representatives with a becoming humility; but the governors of a free people must ever be considered as their servants, and are therefore bound to observe decency towards them, and to act according to their instructions and agreeably to conscience. If the petitions of the freemen of America, couched in decent and respectful terms, will not be attended to; then be it known, that their demands must and will be granted: If no better will do, the ultima ratio regum must secure to the people their rights. God in his providence has crowned them with success once already on this head; and their is little doubt, with the same assistance, but a second attempt will terminate just as much in favor of liberty. The indignity offered to the people and their petitions, by the haughty lordlings of the convention, proclaims the chains of despotism already firmly riveted; like a herald it cries aloud, hush ye slaves, how dare you interrupt your mighty rulers, who alone have a divine right to establish constitutions and governments calculated to promote their own agrandizement and honor. Ah my friends, the days of a cruel Nero approach fast; the language of a monster, of a Caligula, could not be more imperious. I challenge the whole continent, the well born and their parasites, to show an instance of greater insolence than this, on the part of the British tyrant and his infernal junto, to the people of America, before our glorious revolution. My fellow citizens, this is an awful crisis; your situation is alarming indeed; yourselves and your petitions are despised and trampled under the feet of self-important nabobs; whose diabolical plots and secret machinations have been carried on since the revolution, with a view to destroy your liberties, and reduce you to a state of slavery and dependence; and alas! I fear they have found you off your guard, and taken you by surprise: these aspiring men have seized the government, and secured all power, as they suppose, to themselves, now openly browbeat you with their insolence, and assume majesty; and even treat you like menial servants, your representatives as so many conquered slaves, that, they intend to make pass under the [46]yoke, as soon as leisure from their gluttony and rioting on the industry of the poor, shall permit them to attend such a pleasing piece of sport. But I trust, these petty tyrants will soon find to their confussion, that their own imprudent zeal has defeated their designs. Providence has ordered, that they should begin to carry their arbitrary schemes too soon into execution, that, their boundless ambition should precipitate their destruction, and that the glory of God should be made perfect in the salvation of the poor. Blessed be his name, �He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, and exalted them of low degree. He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he hath sent empty away.�4 As a villain, who, secreted to rob and murder in the silent hour of night, issues forth from his lurking place before the people have retired to sleep, and thus frustrates his infernal design by impatience; so in like manner the lust of dominion has urged these despots on to the adoption of measures that will inevitably, and, I hope, immediately unhinge every part of their conspiracy against the rights of their fellow-men, and bring on themselves infamy and disgrace. Figure to yourselves, my brethren, a man with a plantation just sufficient to raise a competency for himself and his dear little children; but by reason of the immoderate revenue necessary to support the emperor, the illustrious well born Congress, the standing army, &c. &c. he necessarily fails in the payment of his taxes; then a hard-hearted federal officer seizes, and sells, his cows, his horses, and even the land itself must be disposed of to answer the demands of government: He pleads unfruitful seasons, his old age, and his numerous, and helpless family. But alas! these avail him nothing, his farm, his cattle, and his all are sold for less than half their value to his wealthy neighbour, already possessed of half the land in the county, to whom also himself and his children must become servants and slaves, or else perish with hunger and want. Do I exaggerate here? No truly. View the misery of the poor under the despotic governments of Europe and Asia, and then deny the truth of my position, if you can. It is a common saying among the poor of Indostan, that to lie is better than to stand, to sleep is better than to wake, but death is best of all; for it delivers them from the cruelty of their nabobs. Even in the freest country in Europe, a lady�s lap-dog is more esteemed than the child of a poor man. O God, what a monster is man! that a dog should be nourished and pampered up by him with dainties; whilst a being, possessed of knowledge, reason, judgement, and an immortal soul, bought with no less a price than the blood of our divine Redeemer, should be driven from his door, without admitting him even for a moment to assuage his hunger with the crumbs that might fall from his table. But the members of the Federal Convention were men who have been all tried in the field of action, say some; they have fought for American liberty: Then the more to their shame be it said; curse on the villain who protects virgin innocence only with a view that he may himself become the ravisher; so that if the assertion were true, it only turns to their disgrace; but as it happens it is not true, or at least only so in part: This was a scheme taken by the despots and their sycophants to biass the public mind in favor of the constitution; for the convention was composed of a variety of characters; ambitious men Jesuites, tories, lawyers, &c. formed the majority, whose similitude to each other, consisted only in their determination to lord it over their fellow citizens; like the rays that converging from every direction meet in a point, their sentiments and deliberations concentered in tyranny alone; they were unanimous in forming a government that should raise the fortunes and respectability of the well born few, and oppress the plebians."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,12/26/1787,"�Distress�d Columbia, must thou lie so low? Must all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils End in thine own disgrace?� My Fellow-Citizens, If America is to become a respectable nation, the people must retain their freedom in the fullest extent possible; this is the sine qua non of our respectability; on this alone must the strength, honor, and national character of this country depend. Indeed, any other system defeats the intention of the revolution; freedom was the ultimate object of the war with Britain, and must, from the nature of things, be the object as long as America remains an independent country. The Turkish empire was established by cruelty and dominion, by the swords of bigotted infidels, whose religion taught them to murder without remorse: probably then, that empire should have been extinct long ago, if the same system of despotism and cruelty had not been preserved; (although there are some authors who affirm that even in Turkey great and valuable privileges have always been enjoyed) but be that as it may, the case is widely different with us; nothing short of pure liberty is consistent with revolution principles; the temple of freedom that was raised in America, was intended by providence to be the asylum of the poor and the oppressed of every nation and every clime. If then we prostitute this hallowed edifice, to purposes for which providence never designed it, our ruin is inevitable. Our national independence will probably not survive the loss of our liberties a single day. As darkness brings the night, so despotism will obliterate the very name of the American empire. It is a principle almost universally confirmed by the joint evidences of reason and experience, that that nation which is most free, is always most victorious; people who enjoy their civil and religious liberty, according to the true sense and meaning of the phrase, are laborious and brave. As the nature of a free government is to protect the lives, liberties, and property of the people, that each may enjoy what he hath by honest industry acquired; so it will be the temper and nature of that people, voluntarily to fight in defence of that government; for its interests and preservation is the same as their own. Hence, under a free constitution which secures the rights and privileges of the people, we will find courage, fortitude, and an unshaken loyalty to that government: but on the contrary, where despotism and tyranny prevail, the people are indolent and pusillanimous, backward to toil [107]and fight in support of a government which their interest must lead them rather to see annihilated than preserved. If we take a view of ancient or modern history, we shall find that freedom and superiority have ever gone hand in hand. The history of England affords us many striking instances to illustrate this truth; the party that fought for their country, in civil broils, has always been victorious over the faction that endeavored to enslave it. But why need I advance examples to prove a point, that the bare mentioning of the American revolution seems to put beyond controversy. If the history of the Turkish empire does not afford an exception to this principle, that freedom and victory are inseparable, there can be none found that I know of, without the conquest of the island of Corsica, by the French, be admitted as one; which certainly ought not, for it rather shows that freemen contending for their liberties are invincible. Since it is obvious from what has been said, that the energy and national strength of America are concomitant with her freedom; it follows then that the adoption of the new constitution which necessarily destroys the latter, must of consequence destroy the former: This constitution, in the first instance, will lop off one half of our sacred rights and privileges, for which we bled and conquered; and the remainder are generally left insecure, and therefore must eventually be lost too; for the cursed lust of dominion can never be satisfied until it is in possession of all power, yea, it even then will be discontent, for it is insatiable. If America is to be great she must be free; freedom is her heart, her very life-blood; and the liberty of the press, like the great aorta, the prime artery, must convey it to the remotest parts of the extremities. That the adoption of this new constitution, in toto, will destroy the freedom of the press, and every other right and liberty that should adorn the freemen of America, has been proved in a clear and masterly manner by many patriotic writers, even before the dissent of the virtuous minority of the convention of Pennsylvania appeared;2 but this gives the matter a finishing stroke: he who denies the evidence of their positions is either a designing villain, or one who insults his own reason, and declares himself incapable of judging right from wrong, or freedom from slavery, and consequently unworthy of enjoying American liberty. The political alchymist, Dr. Rush, in his fulsome speech, that he has so assiduously published, patched, and re-published in all our newspapers,3 says, that our adoption of the new constitution will �produce paleness and distress at the court of St. James�s.� From such a fallacious assertion, one would imagine that the doctor must suppose the people of the United States are already as blind as he would wish to make them, if he thinks they will swallow this his bolus of deceit; such a declaration may probably work upon the prejudices of an American [108]reader, but can never convince his reason. The assertion is false, take it in what sense you will; whether the doctor meant that the adoption of this system of government will produce our misery or prosperity, he is equally wrong. That our establishing a despotic government possessed of every necessary power and qualification for annihilating the freedom of the people, and reducing them to the lowest state of slavery and wretchedness, should excite paleness and distress at the court of London is truly paradoxical; the sentiments of that nation must have undergone a great change; a greater change certainly than any man of common sense can credit. I know there are many good men of patriotic hearts and friends of American liberty in Britain, who will feel the most poignant grief when they hear of its adoption; but that these are of the court party, I can scarce believe: and I question much whether we should not doubt the sincerity of a positive and official declaration of that court, sympathizing with us in our sorrow. So that, upon the whole, I think it is pretty obvious, that the court of St. James�s will not be much distressed at our misery. And that the British government should be distressed on account of the prosperity that must result to this country from our adoption of this system of government is a sophistical falsehood, that a grain of reason is sufficient to detect: Britain will never be distressed by reason of our prosperity under this constitution; for the truth of the matter is, we cannot prosper under it, but on the contrary, we will sink into misery and contempt, and probably cease to be an independent nation: This is a consequence that every politician will necessarily and quickly draw, and that the British, or any other government, must comprehend in an instant: Neither energy, strength nor respectability can exist a moment in America after the adoption of this tyrannical government. There are several who have imagined that this government will for some time be a moderate aristocracy but end in a despotic monarchy;4but this is a mistake; for it must commence in despotism, if ever it has a beginning. A large standing army will be absolutely necessary to set it in motion; I say a large standing army, for a small military force would only excite opposition in its enemies, and encourage them to attempt its destruction, by an appeal to arms. The impolitic conduct of Britain at the commencement of the American war, is a lesson for despotic governments in future; a decisive blow must be struck at once, otherwise liberty may triumph. The advocates of the new constitution must be pretty well convinced by this time, that there are in every state a considerable number of people, perhaps one half of the whole, disaffected to it; now if nine states should really come into the measure, would it be prudent to compel the rest. I think not; although it is already whispered about, that if Virginia, or any of the southern states should not adopt it, that [109]force will certainly be applied; but this is Utopian altogether, nor can I conceive even if every state in the union should adopt it, how this faction can be crushed, and crushed it must be effectually, before this government is firmly established: I even doubt, whether all the military that the well born and their parasites can raise, will complete this piece of business to their satisfaction Has not America already shown to the world that no power on earth can overcome a phalanx of freemen defending their sacred liberties? Many patriotic writers wishing to compromise matters between the friends and enemies of the proposed government, have imagined that the difference might be amicably settled, if a declaration of rights were prefixed to the constitution, so as to become a part of it; and therefore have recommended this to the parties as a necessary measure to reconcile them again to each other: But these good men did not consider that a declaration of rights would effectually and completely annihilate the constitution; of this however, its advocates were well aware, and consequently could not consent to the amendment. No, no, the haughty lordlings and their sycophants must have no limits set to their power; they alone should rule; yes, and rule as they list too: why should any poor poltroon speak of rights; what are his rights? Why, to work as a slave for his well born master. Ah, my fellow-citizens, this is a trying moment! an awful time indeed! Is it possible that the freemen of America should lose their liberties so soon? I hope not; and I trust, that the Lord, who is the friend of the poor and oppressed, will defeat the purposes, and confound the counsels of their haughty enemies; so that �They shall take them captives, whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their oppressors.�5 Amen."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/26/1787,"To the People of Pennsylvania. �Man is the glory, jest, and riddle of the world.� Pope. Incredible transition! the people who seven years ago, deemed every earthly good, every other consideration as worthless, when placed in competition with Liberty, that Heaven-born blessing, that zest of all others; the people, who, actuated by the noble ardor of patriotism, rose superior to every weakness of humanity, and shone with such dazzling lustre amidst the greatest difficulties; who, emulous of eclipsing each other in the glorious assertion of the dignity of human nature, courted every danger, and were ever ready, when necessary, to lay down their lives at the altar of liberty: I say the people, who exhibited so lately a spectacle, that commanded the admiration, and drew the plaudits of the most distant nations, are now revealing the picture, are now lost to every noble principle, are about to sacrifice that inestimable jewel, liberty, to the genius of despotism. A golden phantom held out to them, by the crafty and aspiring despots among themselves, is alluring them into the fangs of arbitrary power; and so great is their infatuation, that it seems, as if nothing short of the reality of misery necessarily attendant on slavery, will rouse them from their false confidence, or convince them of the direful deception; but then alas! it will be too late, the chains of despotism will be fast rivetted, and all escape precluded.  For years past, the harpies of power have been industriously inculcating the idea, that all our difficulties proceed from the impotency of Congress, and have at length succeeded to give to this sentiment almost universal currency and belief: the devastations, losses, and burthens occasioned by the late war; the excessive importations of [99]foreign merchandize and luxuries which have drained the country of its specie, and involved it in debt, are all overlooked, and the inadequacy of the powers of the present confederation is erroneously supposed to be the only cause of our difficulties. Hence, persons of every description are revelling in the anticipation of the halcyon days consequent on the establishment of the new constitution. What gross deception and fatal delusion! For, although very considerable benefit might be derived from strengthening the hands of Congress, so as to enable them to regulate commerce and counteract the adverse restrictions of other nations, which would meet with the concurrence of all persons; yet this benefit is accompanied in the new constitution with the scourge of despotic power, that will render the citizens of America tenants at will of every species of property, of every enjoyment, and make them the meer drudges of government. The gilded bait conceals corrosives that will eat up their whole substance. Since the late able discussion.3 all are now sensible of great defects in the new constitution, are sensible that power is thereby granted without limitation or restriction; yet such is the impatience of people to reap the golden harvest of regulated commerce, that they will not take time to secure their liberty and happiness, nor even to secure the benefit of the expected wealth, but are weakly trusting their every concern to the discretionary disposal of their future rulers; are content to risque every abuse of power, because they are promised a good administration, because moderation and self denial are the characteristic features of men in possession of absolute sway. What egregious folly! What superlative ignorance of the nature of power does such conduct discover! History exhibits this melancholy truth, that slavery has been the lot of nearly the whole of mankind in all ages, and, that the very small portion who have enjoyed the blessings of liberty, have soon been reduced to the common level of slavery and misery. The cause of this general vassalage may be traced to a principle of human nature, which is more powerful and operative than all the others combined; it is that lust of dominion that is inherent in every mind, in a greater or less degree; this is so universal and ever active a passion, as to influence all our actions;4 the different situation and qualifications of men only modifies and varies the complexion and operation of it. For this darling pre-eminence and superiority, the merchant already possessed of a competency, adventures his all in pursuit of greater wealth; it is for this, that men of all descriptions, after having amassed fortunes still persevere in the toils of labour; in short, this is the great principle of exertion in the votaries of riches, learning, and fame. In a savage state, pre-eminence is the result of bodily strength and intrepidity, which compels submission from all such as have the [100]misfortune to be less able; therefore, the great end of civil government is to protect the weak from the oppression of the powerful, to put every man upon the level of equal liberty; but here again, the same lust of dominion by different means frustrate almost always this salutary intention. In a polished state of society, wealth, talents, address, and intrigue, are the qualities that attain superiority in the great sphere of government. The most striking illustration of the prevalence of this lust of dominion is, that the most strenuous assertors of liberty in all ages, after successfully triumphing over tyranny, have themselves become tyrants, when the unsuspicious confidence of an admiring people have entrusted them with unchecked power: rare are the instances of self-denial, or consistency of conduct in the votaries of liberty, when they have become possessed of the reins of authority; it has been the peculiar felicity of America, that her great deliverer did not prove a Cromwell.5 Compare the declarations of the most zealous asserters of religious liberty whilst under the lash of persecution, with their conduct when in power; you will find that even the benevolence and humility inculcated in the gospels prove no restraint upon this love of domination�The mutual contentions of the several sects of religion in England some ages since, are sufficient evidence of this truth. The annals of mankind demonstrate the precarious tenure of privileges and property dependent upon the will and pleasure of rulers; these illustrate the fatal danger of relying upon the moderation and self-denial of men exposed to the temptations that the Congress under the new constitution will be. The lust of power or domination is of that nature, as seeks to overcome every obstacle, and does not remit its exertions whilst any object of conquest remains, nothing short of the plenitude of dominion will satisfy this cursed demon: therefore liberty is only to be preserved by a due responsibility in the government, and by the constant attention of the people; whenever that responsibility has been lessened, or this attention remitted, in the same degree has arbitrary sway prevailed. The celebrated Montesquieu has warned mankind of the danger of an implicit reliance on rulers; he says, that �a perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, is absolutely requisite in all free states:�6 and again �that slavery is ever preceded by sleep.�7 I shall conclude with an extract from a speech delivered by lord George Digby, afterwards earl of Bristol, in the English parliament, on the triennial bill, anno 1641, viz. �It hath been a maxim among the wisest legislators, that whosoever means to settle good laws, must proceed in them with a sinister opinion of all mankind, and suppose that whosoever is not wicked, it is for want only of the opportunity. It is that opportunity of being ill, Mr. Speaker, that we must take away, if [101]ever we mean to be happy, which can never be done but by the frequency of parliaments. �No state can wisely be confident of any public minister�s continuing good, longer than the rod is held over him. �Let me appeal to all those that were present in this house at the agitation of the petition of right: and let them tell themselves truly of whose promotion to the management of public affairs do they think the generality would at that time have had better hopes than of Mr. Noy and Sir Thomas Wentworth; both having been at that time and in that business as I have heard, most keen and active patriots, and the latter of them, to the eternal aggravation of his infamous treachery to the commonwealth be it spoken, the first mover, and insister to have this clause added to the petition of right, viz. ��That for the comfort and safety of his subjects, his majesty would be pleased to declare his will and pleasure that all his ministers should serve him according to the laws and statutes of the realm.� �And yet Mr. Speaker to whom now can all the inundations upon our liberties, under pretence of law, and the late ship-wreck at once of all our property be attributed more than to Noy, and all those other mischiefs whereby this monarchy hath been brought almost to the brink of destruction, so much to any as to that grand apostate to the commonwealth, the now lieutenant of Ireland. Sir Thomas Wentworth? Let every man but consider those men as once they were.� British Liberties, page 184 and 185.8 Philadelphia, Dec. 22, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,12/29/1787,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Friends and Fellow-Citizens! The admiring world lately beheld the sun of liberty risen to meridian splendour in this western hemisphere, whose chearing rays began to dispel the glooms of even trans-atlantic despotism: the patriotic mind, enraptured with the glowing scene, fondly anticipated an universal and eternal day to the orb of freedom; but the horison is already darkened and the glooms of slavery threaten to fix their empire. How transitory are the blessings of this life! Scarcely have four years elapsed since these United States, rescued from the domination of foreign despots by the unexampled heroism and perseverance of its citizens, at such great expence of blood and treasure, when they are about to fall a prey to the machinations of a profligate junto at home, who seizing the favorable moment, when the temporary and extraordinary difficulties of the people have thrown them off their guard, and lulled that jealousy of power so essential to the preservation of freedom, have been too successful in the sacrilegious attempt; however I am confident that this formidable conspiracy will end in the confusion and infamy of its authors; that if necessary, the avenging sword of an abused people will humble these aspiring despots to the dust, and that their fate, like that of Charles the First of England, will deter such attempts in future, and prove the confirmation of the liberties of America until time shall be no more. One would imagine by the insolent conduct of these harpies of power, that they had already triumphed over the liberties of the people, that the chains were rivetted and tyranny established. They tell us all further opposition will be in vain, as this state has passed the rubicon. Do they imagine the freemen of Pennsylvania will be thus trepaned out of their liberties; that they will submit without a struggle? They must indeed be inebriated with the lust of dominion to indulge such chimerical ideas. Will the act of one sixth of the people,2 and this too founded on deception and surprise, bind the community? Is it thus that the altar of liberty, so recently crimsoned with the blood of our worthies, is to be prostrated and despotism reared on its ruins? Certainly not. The solemn mumery that has been acting in the name of the people of Pennsylvania will be treated with the deserved contempt; it has served indeed to expose the principles of the men concerned, and to draw a line of discrimination between the real and affected patriots. Impressed with an high opinion of the understanding and spirit of my fellow citizens, I have in no stage of this business entertained a doubt of its eventual defeat; the momentary delusion, arising from an unreserved confidence placed in some of the characters whose names sanctioned this scheme of power, did not discourage me: I foresaw that [179]this blind admiration would soon be succeeded by rational investigation, which, stripping the monster of its gilded covering, would discover its native deformity. Already the enlightened pen of patriotism, aided by an able public discussion, has dispelled the mist of deception, and the great body of the people are awakened to a due sense of their danger, and are determined to assert their liberty, if necessary by the sword,3 but this mean need not be recurred to, for who are their enemies? A junto composed of the lordly and high minded gentry, of the profligate and the needy office-hunters; of men principally who in the late war skulked from the common danger. Would such characters dare to face the majesty of a free people? No.�All the conflict would be between the offended justice and generosity of the people, whether these sacrilegious invaders of their dearest rights should suffer the merited punishment, or escape with an infamous contempt? However, as additional powers are necessary to Congress, the people will no doubt see the expediency of calling a convention for this purpose as soon as may be, by applying to their representatives in assembly, at their next session, to appoint a suitable day for the election of such Convention. Philadelphia, December 27, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/2/1788,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Fellow Citizens, Under the benign influence of liberty, this country, so recently a rugged wilderness and the abode of savages and wild beasts, has attained to a degree of improvement and greatness, in less than two ages, of which history furnishes no parallel: It is here that human nature may be viewed in all its glory; man assumes the station designed him by the creation; a happy equality and independency pervades the community; it is here the human mind, untrammeled by the restraints of arbitrary power, expands every faculty: as the field to fame and riches is open to all, it stimulates universal exertion, and exhibits a lively picture of emulation, industry and happiness. The unfortunate and oppressed of all nations, fly to this grand asylum, where liberty is ever protected, and industry crowned with success. But as it is by comparison only that men estimate the value of any good, they are not sensible of the worth of those blessings they enjoy, until they are deprived of them; hence from ignorance of the horrors of slavery, nations, that have been in possession of that rarest of blessings, liberty, have so easily parted with it: when groaning under the yoke of tyranny what perils would they not encounter, what consideration would they not give to regain the inestimable jewel they had lost; but the jealousy of despotism guards every avenue to freedom, and confirms its empire at the expence of the devoted people, whose property is made instrumental to their misery, for the rapacious hand of power seizes upon every thing; dispair presently succeeds, and every noble faculty of the mind being depressed, and all motive to industry and exertion being removed, the people are adapted to the nature of the government, and drag out a listless existence. If ever America should be enslaved it will be from this cause, that they are not sensible of their peculiar felicity, that they are not aware of the value of the heavenly boon, committed to their care and protection, and if the present conspiracy fails, as I have no doubt will be the case, it will be the triumph of reason and philosophy, as these United States have never felt the iron hand of power, or experienced the wretchedness of slavery. The conspirators against our liberties have presumed too much on the maxim that nations do not take the alarm, until they feel oppression: the enlightened citizens of America have on two memorable occasions convinced the tyrants of Europe that they are endued with the faculty of foresight, that they will jealously guard against the first introduction of tyranny, however speciously glossed over, or whatever appearance it may assume: It was not the mere amount of the duty on stamps, or tea that America opposed, they were [232]considered as signals of approaching despotism, as precedents whereon the superstructure of arbitrary sway was to be reared. Notwithstanding such illustrious evidence of the good sense and spirit of the people of these United States, and contrary to all former experience of mankind, which demonstrates that it is only by gradual and imperceptible degrees that nations have hitherto been enslaved, except in case of conquest by the sword; the authors of the present conspiracy are attempting to seize upon absolute power at one grasp, impatient of dominion they have adopted a decisive line of conduct, which, if successful, would obliterate every trace of liberty. I congratulate my fellow citizens that the infatuated confidence of their enemies has so blinded their ambition, that their defeat must be certain and easy, if imitating the refined policy of successful despots, they had attacked the citadel of liberty by sap, and gradually undermined its outworks, they would have stood a fairer chance of effecting their design; but in this enlightened age thus rashly to attempt to carry the fortress by storm, is folly indeed. They have even exposed some of their batteries prematurely, and thereby unfolded every latent view, for the unlimited power of taxation would alone have been amply sufficient for every purpose; by a proper application of this, the will and pleasure of the rulers would of course have become the supreme law of the land; therefore there was no use in portraying the ultimate object, by superadding the form to reality of supremacy in the following clause, viz. that which empowers the new congress to make all laws that may be necessary and proper for carrying into execution any of their powers, by virtue of which every possible law will be constitutional, as they are to be the sole judges of the propriety of such laws, that which ordains that their acts shall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the laws or constitution of any state to the contrary notwithstanding; that which gives Congress the absolute controul over the time and mode of its appointment and election, whereby, independent of any other means, they may establish hereditary despotism; that which authorizes them to keep on foot at all times a standing army; and that which subjects the militia to absolute command�and to accelerate the subjugation of the people, trial by jury in civil cases and the liberty of the press are abolished. So flagrant, so audacious a conspiracy against the liberties of a free people is without precedent. Mankind in the darkest ages have never been so insulted; even then, tyrants found it necessary to pay some respect to the habits and feelings of the people, and nothing but the name of a Washington could have occasioned a moment�s hesitation about the nature of the new plan, or saved its authors from the execration and vengeance of the people, which eventually will prove an aggravation of their treason; for America will resent the imposition [233]practised upon the unsuspicious zeal of her illustrious deliverer, and vindicate her character from the aspersions of these enemies of her happiness and fame. The advocates of this plan have artfully attempted to veil over the true nature and principles of it with the names of those respectable characters that by consummate cunning and address they have prevailed upon to sign it, and what ought to convince the people of the deception and excite their apprehensions, is that with every advantage which education, the science of government and of law, the knowledge of history and superior talents and endowments, furnish the authors and advocates of this plan with, they have from its publication exerted all their power and influence to prevent all discussion of the subject, and when this could not be prevented they have constantly avoided the ground of argument and recurred to declamation, sophistry and personal abuse, but principally relied upon the magic of names. Would this have been their conduct, if their cause had been a good one? No, they would have invited investigation and convinced the understandings of the people. But such policy indicates great ignorance of the good sense and spirit of the people, for if the sanction of every convention throughout the union was obtained by the means these men are practising; yet their triumph would be momentary, the favorite object would still elude their grasp; for a government founded on fraud and deception could not be maintained without an army sufficiently powerful to compel submission, which the well born of America could not speedily accomplish. However the complexion of several of the more considerable states does not promise even this point of success. The Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, New-York and New-Hampshire have by their wisdom in taking a longer time to deliberate, in all probability saved themselves from the disgrace of becoming the dupes of this gilded bait, as experience will evince that it need only be properly examined to be execrated and repulsed. The merchant, immersed in schemes of wealth, seldom extends his views beyond the immediate object of gain; he blindly pursues his seeming interest, and sees not the latent mischief; therefore it is, that he is the last to take the alarm when public liberty is threatened. This may account for the infatuation of some of our merchants, who, elated with the imaginary prospect of an improved commerce under the new government, overlook all danger: they do not consider that commerce is the hand-maid of liberty, a plant of free growth that withers under the hand of despotism, that every concern of individuals will be sacrificed to the gratification of the men in power, who will institute injurious monopolies and shackle commerce with every device of avarice; and that property of every species will be held at the will and pleasure of rulers. If the nature of the case did not give birth to these well-founded apprehensions, the principles and characters of the authors and advocates of the measure ought. View the monopolising spirit of the principal of them. See him converting a bank, instituted for common benefit, to his own and creatures emolument, and by the aid thereof, controuling the credit of the state, and dictating the measures of government.2 View the vassalage of our merchants, the thraldom of the city of Philadelphia, and the extinction of that spirit of independency in most of its citizens so essential to freedom. View this Collosus attempting to grasp the commerce of America and meeting with a sudden repulse, in the midst of his immense career, receiving a shock that threatens his very existence. View the desperate fortunes of many of his co-adjutors and dependants, particularly the bankrupt situation of the principal instrument under the great man in promoting the new government, whose superlative arrogance, ambition and repacity, would need the spoils of thousands to gratify; view his towering aspect, he would have no bowels of compassion for the oppressed, he would overlook all their sufferings.3 Recollect the strenuous and unremitted exertions of these men, for years past, to destroy our admirable constitution, whose object is to secure equal liberty and advantages to all, and the great obstacle in the way of their ambitious schemes, and then answer, whether these apprehensions are chimerical, whether such characters will be less ambitious, less avaritious, more moderate, when the privileges, property, and every concern of the people of the United States shall lie at their mercy, when they shall be in possession of absolute sway?

Junkin, John Carothers Jr., James Fleming, Thomas Carothers",,Carlisle Gazette,,1/2/1788,"The history of mankind is pregnant with frequent, bloody, and almost imperceptible transitions from freedom to slavery. Rome, after she had been long distracted by the fury of the patrician and plebeian parties, at length found herself reduced to the most abject slavery [652]under a Nero, a Caligula, etc. The successive convulsions, which happened at Rome, were the immediate consequence of the aspiring ambition of a few great men, and the very organization and construction of the government itself. The republic of Venice, by the progressive and almost imperceptible encroachments of the nobles, has at length degenerated into an odious and permanent aristocracy. This we are convinced, by indubitable demonstration, will be the final consequence of the proposed Federal Constitution; and because we prize the felicity and freedom of our posterity equally with our own, we esteem it our indispensable duty to oppose it with that determined resolution and spirit that becomes freemen. That fire for liberty which was kindled in every patriotic breast during the late glorious contention, though in a latent state, will be easily rekindled; and upon the contact of a very spark will devour by its direful explosion, not only the enemies of liberty, but both parties promiscuously. Discontent, indignation, and revenge already begins to be visible in every patriotic countenance; and civil discord already raises her sneaky head. And we are well convinced that nothing less than a total recantation and annihilation of the proposed aristocratic delusion will appease the insulted and enraged defenders of liberty. If the lazy and great wish to ride, they may lay it down as an indubitable position or axiom, that the people of America will make very refractory and restiff hackneys. Although the designing and artful Federalists have effected their scheme so far as to have the Constitution adopted in this state by surprise, notwithstanding the people are pretty generally convinced of their delusion, and little less than the lives of their betrayers will satiate their revenge. Not even the authority of the clergy, who seem generally to have been a set of men decidedly opposed to popular freedom, can give sanction to such a government. The people of America understand their rights better than, by adopting such a constitution, to rivet the fetters of slavery; or to sacrifice their liberty at the shrine of aristocracy or arbitrary government. We, the subscribers, are a society united for the express purpose of reciprocal or mutual improvement; we meet once a week, and political matters are frequently the subjects of litigation and debate. We have read and endeavored fully to comprehend the proposed Federal Constitution; and also the arguments for and against it; and after mature deliberation, we unanimously acquiesce with, and cordially thank you the minority in the late state Convention: First, for your patriotic and spirited endeavors to support the drooping cause of liberty and rights of your constituents. Secondly, for your integrity and firmness in stemming the torrent of popular clamor, insult, and flattery. Thirdly, for your unanswerable, solid, and well-founded arguments and reason [653]of dissent. Lastly, we rejoice to think that your names will shine illustriously in the page of history, and will be read with honor and grateful remembrance in the annals of fame; while the names of the majority, and their ignorant tools will be spurned and execrated by the succeeding generations as the pillars of slavery, tyranny, and despotism."
Newspaper,No,William Penn,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/2/1788,"To the Citizens of the United States. 3.12. I Fellow Citizens, At this important moment which is to decide on your future happiness or misery by the adoption or rejection of the new proposed form of government, a cool and dispassionate investigation of that system becomes indispensably necessary-I have waited for a considerable time, hoping that the subject would be taken up by some abler pen than mine-I have been disappointed in my expectation-a great many pieces have indeed appeared, which have thrown a considerable light on this interesting subject, but they have been mostly of the desultory kind, and no person (at least that I know of) has as yet attempted a methodical examination of the proposed constitution, or a comparative view of its principles with the principles of a government in general, and of a federal government in particular-Although I am greatly deficient in the necessary abilities, I have however undertaken the arduous task; and I propose, in this and the ensuing papers, to go through it in the best manner I am able, and without attempting to display any ornament or elegance of style, I shall endeavour to explain my ideas with clearness and simplicity-my sole object is to be understood, and to render (if possible) these observations as useful, as their subject is interesting. I shall in the first place lay down general principles, and proceed afterwards to their applications. I shall make very few quotations, from political writers, and take very few examples from the government of other countries whether ancient or modem-truth needs nothing but itself to enforce conviction on unprejudiced minds, and principles are a thousand times above precedents. I shall therefore begin with examining into the nature of government in general. Government in its general sense may be defined a human institution by which certain powers are delegated by the people to one or more citizens to preserve their national existence, and secure to each individual, the enjoyment of his natural rights: otherwise, in the words of the constitution of Massachusetts, It is a social compact by which the whole people convenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good. I Government was originally instituted for the benefit of mankind-The welfare of the community is the great end which, under every form, it is intended to obtain-but what is the best form of government has long been an object of dispute among the learned and speculative. It is not true that that government is best which is best administered-it is a sophism invented by tyranny to quiet the inquisitive mind; a good administration is at best but a temporary palliative to a bad government, but it does not alter its nature, any more than a bad man by doing one good action in the course of his life, ceases to be a bad man. 2 The best government is certainly that which is the least liable to be ill administered, in which the rulers have the most power to do good and the least to do evil. In other words it is that in which the natural rights of mankind are the most inviolably secured. And of consequence as liberty is the most essential of those rights, which man holds by inheritance from all-bountiful nature, that which takes from him the least share of that liberty ought to be the best-for the same principle holds in the political as in the mechanical science, and that machine in either must be allowed to be the most perfect, which with the least strength performs the greatest execution. But here a long agitated question will occur: What is liberty? What is that supreme good which every one feels, and so very few can define?-I would call it the unlimited power of doing good, and without very critically examining into this definition, I know not what internal voice tells me that I am not mistaken. But again, What is good?-When that is fully known and understood, men will no longer differ about forms of government; it is the tree of knowledge which we have as yet only tasted; it is that we have for thousands of years, with various successes, been eagerly seeking after; it is the ultimate end of the painful researches of the human mind, and the object of these disquisitions. Without going too deep into metaphysical investigations, that are no part of our present design, let us go back to the leading principle already established, that the best government is that which secures to the citizens the greatest share of their natural rights: their full extent unfortunately is not yet known to us; it is by slow, and often interrupted, steps that we have discovered those we now enjoy. That discovery is owing partly to our own sad experience, and partly to the philanthropic researches of those chosen few to whom the Almighty has in his mercy bestowed a larger portion of the ethereal fire than usually falls to the lot of the common race of men. Those men, whom we call philosophers or lovers of wisdom, have generally been persecuted while they lived, and have had altars erected to them after their death. Because prejudice, supported by private interest. has always stood in the way of useful truths, which however have in the end seldom failed to prevail. And wherever a sufficient number of those truths has been established and generally diffused, liberty and happiness have become the portion of every nation so enlightened-liberty is the fair offspring of 3. 12 . 8 3. 12 . 10 knowledge, as tyranny is the grim-child of ignorance. In this respect America is of all other nations the most favored of Heaven-The book of the constitutions of the different states,3 reflects such a mass of light as would have dazzled the greatest philosophers of antiquity. After the holy scriptures, it is certainly of all books that which contains the greatest store of eternal truths. I never open that sacred volume without feeling a kind of awful reverence, mixed with gratitude to the Almighty giver of all good gifts, who has been pleased to enlighten the minds of the legislators of this favored nation. The truths which those great men have thus declared and established, are not (000 be thanked) solely consigned to books made of perishable materials; they are deeply engraved in the hearts of every American. This nation may boast of enjoying the greatest collective store of political knowledge of any people on earth. Maxims of the utmost importance to the happiness of mankind, are familiar to our meanest citizens, which many eminent Philosophers in other parts of the world, have perhaps never had an idea of hence it must be inferred, that if we are ever brought into slavery, we shall never be allowed the easy plea of ignorance: the nations that now envy us, will despise our meanness, and see our miseries without pity. Let us therefore try this new federal constitution that is now offered to us by the light of our own knowledge-Let us recur to those original principles upon which our present constitutions have been established. These guides never can mislead us; they are a sure touchstone to try any form of government by. If we find the federal plan conformable to those principles , let us by all means adopt it, and thereby secure perpetual happiness to ourselves and our posterity – If, on the contrary, we find that it is built on a different foundation, we must not hesitate a moment, but with a manly firmness, worthy of ourselves, unanimously reject it. William Penn."
Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,1/2/1788,"By a gentleman of veracity and information, who arrived in this city yesterday from New York, we are assured, that there is not the smallest probability of the new constitution being adopted in that State. He says, that the Address and Dissent of the minority of the Convention of Pennsylvania has done great execution there,2 but the last numbers of Publius have done still more; as that writer’s attempts to prove the expediency of supporting a standing army in time of peace have been so futile, that even the friends of the new plan are offended with them.3 His barefaced assertions, that our existence as a nation depends upon our keeping up a large military, to defend us on the north from the British, on the west from the Indians, on the south from the Spaniards, and on the Atlantic side from the invasions of a maritime enemy, have alarmed the people exceedingly. The common talk is, Well, what do you think of being surrounded with a standing army?"
Newspaper,No,William Penn,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/3/1788,"To the Citizens of the United States. Fellow Citizens, I shall now proceed to lay down the principles that I think necessary to the formation of a free government. and without which, I sincerely believe, no true liberty can exist. I shall not here take notice of the scholastic division of government into three kinds, to wit, monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, nor consider separately the nature and effects of each of these different species. At present I shall confine my enquiries entirely to a democracy, or government, of the people, which I am confident is the only one under which liberty can be obtained or preserved. The two other forms of government are so essentially different from it, that it is impossible they should have been intended to obtain the same, and which can never be done by following opposite roads. The unity of truth is as fixed and immutable a principle as that of the Divinity from whence it springs, and whose chief attribute it is. If so, no two opposite principles in government, any more than in any other science. can be equally founded upon it. Whether it was given to man to reach the source of the great fountain of truth, from which all true principles are derived, as rivers flow from the sea, it is not in my power to determine. We ought at least, with cautious and diffident steps, to approach it as nearly as we can, and treasure up and secure to ourselves and our posterity, the advantage of those partial truths, which the human mind is allowed to discover, waiting with confidence in HIM who constantly watches over his favorite creature man, and made him to be happy; for the blessed time when we shall perhaps discover the grand principle, which, when once found, it will not be in our power any more to tread the paths of error. Then, and not till then, may we expect to see the days foretold by the greatest philosopher of antiquity, when laws and government (their true principles being known to all the world) will be the same through all mankind Non erit lex alia Romae, alia Athenis, alia, nunc, alia posthac, sed et omni tempore, et apud omnes gentes, una eadem qua lex obtinebit. Cic. Fragm. de Repub. [III, 22]. I believe that it is universally agreed upon in this enlightened country, that all power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them, they ought to be governed by themselves only, or by their immediate representatives. I shall not spend any time in explaining a principle so well and so generally understood, but I shall proceed immediately to that which I conceive to be the next in order. The next principle, without which it must be clear that no free government can ever subsist, is the DIVISION OF POWER among those who are charged with the execution of it. It has always been the favorite maxim of princes, to divide the people, in order to govern them; it is now time that the people should avail themselves of the same maxim, and divide power among their rulers, in order to prevent their abusing it-The application of this great political truth, has long been unknown to the world, and yet it is grounded upon a very plain natural principle,-If, says Montesquieu, the same man, or body of men, is possessed both of the legislative and executive power, there is NO LIBERTY, because it may be feared that the same monarch, or the same senate, will enact tyrannical laws, in order to execute them in a tyrannical manner-nothing can be clearer, and the natural disposition of man, to ambition and power, makes it probable that such would be the consequence-suppose for instance, that the same body, which has the power of raising money by taxes, is also entrusted with the application of that money, they will very probably raise large sums, and apply them to their own private uses; if they are empowered to create offices, and appoint the officers, they will take that opportunity of providing for themselves, and their friends, and if they have the power of inflicting penalties for offences, and of trying the offenders, there will be no bounds to their tyranny. Liberty therefore can only subsist, where the powers of government are properly divided, and where the different jurisdictions are inviolably kept distinct and separate.* The first and most natural division of the powers of government are into the legislative and executive branches. These two should never be suffered to have the least share of each others jurisdiction, or to intermeddle with it in any manner. For which ever of the two divides its power with the other, will certainly be subordinate to it, and if they both have a share of each others authority, they will be in fact but one body; their interest as well as their powers will be the same, and they will combine together against the people. It is therefore a political error of the greatest magnitude, to allow the executive power a negative, or in fact any kind of control over the proceedings of the legislature. 6 The people of Great Britain have been so sensible of this truth, that since the days of William III. no king of England has dared to exercise the negative over the acts of the two houses of parliament, to which he is clearly entitled by his prerogative. This doctrine is not novel in America, it seems on the contrary to be every where well understood and admitted beyond controversy; in the bills of rights or constitutions of New-Hampshire. Massachusetts. Maryland. Virginia. North-Carolina and Georgia. it is expressly declared, That the legislative. executive and judicial departments. shall be forever separate and distinct from each other.7 In Pennsylvania and Delaware. they are effectually separated without any particular declaration of the principle. In the other states indeed, the executive branch possesses more or less of the executive [legislative?] power-And here it must appear singular that the state of Massachusetts, where the doctrine of a separate jurisdiction is most positively established, and in whose bill of rights these remarkable words are to be found: The executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them, to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men. (§30)8 Yet in that commonwealth and New-Hampshire, the executive branch, which consists of a single magistrate. has more controul over the legislature than in any other state; for there, if the governor refuse's his assent to a bill, it cannot be passed into a law, unless two-thirds of the house afterwards concur. In New-York the same power is given to a Council of Revision, consisting of the Governor, the Chancellor and Judges of the Supreme Court, or any three of them, of which the Governor is to be one. In Rhode-Island and Connecticut, whose governments were established before the revolution, the Governor has a single vote as a member of the upper house, and New-Jersey has adopted this part of their constitution. In Georgia the laws are to be revised by the Governor and Council, but they can do no more than give their opinion upon them. In Maryland the bills are to be signed by the governor before they can be enacted, and in South-Carolina they are to be sealed with the great seal, which is in the governor's custody. But in the first of these states, the constitution prescribes, that the governor shall sign the bills, and in the latter, a joint committee of both houses of legislature is to wait upon chief magistrate to receive and return the great seal, which implies that he is bound to deliver it to them, for the special purpose of affixing it to the laws of the state. Pennsylvania has proceeded upon a much more rational ground, their legislature having a particular seal of their own, and their laws requiring only to be signed by the speaker. If in Maryland or South-Carolina a difference should ever arise between the legislature and the governor, and the latter should refuse to sign the laws, or to deliver the great seal, the most fatal consequences might ensue. 3·12.17 3. 12 . 18 Here then we see the great leading principle of the absolute division of the legislative from the executive jurisdiction, admitted in almost every one of the American states as a fundamental maxim in the politics of a free country. The theory of this general doctrine is every where established, though a few states have somewhat swerved from it in the practice. From whence we must conclude, that even the knowledge and full conviction of a new political truth will not always immediately conquer inveterate habits and prejudices. The idea of the negative, which the constitution of England gives to the monarch over the proceedings of the other branches of parliament, although it has so long become obsolete, has had an effect upon timid minds, and upon the minds of those who could not distinguish between the form and spirit of the British constitution. They would not grant to the executive branch an absolute negative over the legislature, but yet they tried every method to introduce something similar to it. They reprobated the doctrine in the most express words, and yet they could not bear to part entirely with it. It is curious to observe how many different ways they have endeavored to conciliate truth with prejudice. Of those states who have allowed the executive branch to intermeddle with the proceedings of the legislature, no two (New-Hampshire and Massachusetts excepted) have done it exactly in the same manner. They have tried every possible medium, but having lost sight of the original principle which they had already established, and which alone could have been their safest guide, they groped about in the dark, and could not find any solid ground on which to establish a general rule. Like Noah's dove, being once out of the ark of truth, they could not find elsewhere a place to rest their feet. These facts will no doubt afford an interesting page in the history of the contradictions of the human mind. Unfortunately, they do not stand single, and this is not the only instance that we find in the constitutions of the different states, of a general principle being expressly declared as a part of the natural rights of the citizens, and afterwards being as expressly contradicted in the practice. Thus we find it declared in every one of our bills of rights, that there shall be a perfect liberty of conscience, and that no sect shall ever be entitled to a preference over the others. Yet in Massachusetts and Maryland, all the officers of government, and in Pennsylvania the members of the legislature, are to be of the Christian religion; in New-Jersey, North-Carolina, and Georgia, the protestant, and in Delaware, the trinitarian sects, have an exclusive right to public employments; and in South-Carolina the constitution goes so far as to declare the creed of the established church. Virginia and New-York are the only states where there is a perfect liberty of conscience. I cannot say any thing as to Connecticut and Rhode-Island, as their constitutions are silent on the subject, and I have not been informed of their practice. Whether these religious restrictions are right or wrong it is not my intention. nor is it my object to examine in the course of these disquisitions-I only meant to shew. that in laying down a political system it is safer to rely on principles than upon precedents, because the former are fixed and immutable, while the latter vary with men, places, times and circumstances.

Fellow Citizens, You have the peculiar felicity of living under the most perfect system of local government in the world; prize then this invaluable blessing as it deserves: Suffer it not to be wrested from you, and the scourge of despotic power substituted in its place, under the specious pretence of vesting the general government of the United States with necessary power; that this would be the inevitable con�sequence of the establishment of the new constitution, the least consideration of its nature and tendency is sufficient to convince every unprejudiced mind. If you were sufficiently impressed with your present favored situation, I should have no doubt of a proper dicision of the question in discussion. The highest illustration of the excellence of the constitution of this commonwealth, is, that from its first establishment, the ambitious and profligate have been united in a constant conspiracy to destroy it; so sensible are they that it is their great enemy, that it is the great palladium of equal liberty, and the property of the people from the rapacious hand of power: The annals of mankind do not furnish a more glorious instance of the triumph of patriotism over the lust of ambition aided by most of the wealth of the state. The few generally prevail over the many by uniformity of council, unremitted and persevering exertion, and superior information and address; but in Pennsylvania the reverse has happened; here the well�born have been baffled in all their efforts to prostrate the altar of liberty for the purpose of substituting their own insolent sway that would degrade the freemen of this state into servile dependence upon the lordly and great: However, it is not the nature of ambition to be discouraged; it is ever ready to improve the first opportunity to rear its baneful head and with irritated fury to wreak its vengeance on the votaries of liberty. The present conspiracy is a continental exertion of the well born of America to obtain that darling domination, which they have not been able to accomplish in their respective states. Of what complexion were the deputies of this state in the general convention? Six out of eight were the inveterate enemies of our inestimable constitution, and the principals of that faction that for ten years past have kept the people in continual alarm for their liberties.� Who are the advocates of the new constitution in this state? They consist of the same faction, with the addition of a few deluded well�meaning men, but whose number is daily lessening. These conspirators have come forward at a most favorable conjuncture, when the state of public affairs has lulled all jealousy of power: Emboldened by the sanction of the august name of a Washington, that they have prostituted to their purpose, they have presumed to overleap the usual gradations to absolute power, and have attempted to seize at once upon the supremacy of dominion. The new instrument of government does indeed make a fallacious parade of some remaining privileges, and insults the understandings of the people with the semblance of liberty in some of its artful and deceptive clauses: which form but a flimsy veil over the reality of tyranny, so weakly endeavored to be concealed from the eye of freedom. For, of what avail are the few inadequate stipulations in favor of the rights of the people, when they may be effectually counteracted and destroyed by virtue of other clauses; when these enable the rulers to renounce all dependence on their constituents, and render the latter tenants at will of every concern? The new constitution is in fact a carte blanche, a surrender at discretion to the will and pleasure of our rulers: as this has been demonstrated to be the case, by the investigation and discussion that have taken place, I trust the same good sense and spirit which have hitherto enabled the people to triumph over the wiles of ambition, will be again exerted for their salvation. The accounts from various parts of the country correspond with my warmest hopes, and justify my early predictions of the eventual defeat of this scheme of power and office making. The genius of liberty has sounded the alarm, and the dormant spirit of her votaries is reviving with enthusiastic ardor; the like unanimity which formerly distinguished them in their conflict with foreign despots, promises to crown their virtuous opposition on the present occasion, with signal success. The structure of despotism that has been reared in this state, upon deception and surprise, will vanish like the baseless fabric of a dream and leave not a trace behind. The parasites and tools of power in Northampton county ought to take warning from the fate of the Carlisle junto, lest like them, they experience the resentment of an injured people. I would advise them not to repeat the imposition of a set of fallacious resolutions as the sense of that county, when in fact, it was the act of a despicable few, with Alexander Paterson3 at their head, whose atchievements at Wyoming, as the meaner instrument of unfeeling avarice, have rendered infamously notorious; but yet, like the election of a Mr. Sedgwick for the little town of Stockbridge,� which has been adduced as evidence of the unanimity of the western counties of Massachusetts state in favor of the new constitution, when the fact is far otherwise, this act of a few individuals will be sounded forth over the continent as a testimony of the zealous attachment of the county of Northampton to the new constitution. By such wretched and momentary deceptions do these harpies of power endeavor to give the complexion of strength to their cause. To prevent the detection of such impositions, to prevent the reflection of the rays of light from state to state, which, producing general illumination, would dissipate the mist of deception, and thereby prove fatal to the new constitution, all intercourse between the patriots of America is as far as possible cut off; whilst on the other hand, the conspirators have the most exact information, a common concert is every where evident, they move in unison. There is so much mystery in the conduct of these men, such systematic deception, and fraud characterises all their measures, such extraordinary solicitude shewn by them to precipitate and surprise the people into a blind and implicit adoption of this government, that it ought to excite the most alarming apprehensions in the minds of all those who think their privileges, property and welfare worth securing. It is a fact that can be established, that during almost the whole of the time that the late convention of this state were assembled, the newspapers published in New�York, by Mr. Greenleaf, which contains the essays written there against the new government, such as the patriotic ones of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &c. sent as usual by the printer of that place, to the printers of this city, miscarried in their conveyance, which prevented the republication in this state of many of these pieces, and since that period great irregularity prevails; and I stand informed that the printers in New�York complain that the free and independent newspapers of this city do not come to hand; whilst on the contrary, we find the devoted vehicles of despotism pass uninterrupted. I would ask what is the meaning of the new arrangement at the Post�Office, which abridges the circulation of newspapers at this momentous crisis, when our every concern is dependant upon a proper decision of the subject in discussion�No trivial excuse will he admitted; the Centinel will, as from the first approach of despotism, warn his countrymen of the insidious and base stratagems that are practising to hoodwink them out of their liberties. The more I consider the manoevres that are practising, the more am I alarmed�foreseeing that the juggle cannot long be concealed, and that the spirit of the people will not brook the imposition, they have guarded as they suppose against any danger arising from the opposition of the people, and rendered their struggles for liberty impotent and ridiculous. What otherwise is the meaning of disarming the militia, for the purpose as it is said, of repairing their musquets at such a particular period?� Does not the timing of the measure determine the intention? I was ever jealous of the select militia, consisting of infantry and troops of horse, instituted in this city and in some of the counties, without the sanction of law, and officered principally by the devoted instruments of the well born, although the illustrious patriotism of one of them, has not corresponded with the intention of appointing him. Are not these corps provided to suppress the first efforts of freedom, and to check the spirit of the people until a regular and sufficiently powerful military force shall be embodied to rivet the chains of slavery on a deluded nation. What confirms these apprehensions is the declaration of a certain Major, an active instrument in this business, and the echo of the principal conspirators, who has said, he should deem the cutting off of five thousand men, as a small sacrifice, a cheap purchase for the establishment of the new constitution. Philadelphia, January 5, 1788."
Newspaper,No,One of the People,,Carlisle Gazette,An Old Man,1/9/1788,"AN OLD MAN, who pretends to be an impartial spectator, has taken upon him to furnish the public with a state of the facts, respecting what he calls �the riot on Wednesday the 26th of December last; as also of the burning the effigies of two of the most distinguished characters in the state.�(a) The vein of misrepresentation and falsehood that runs through this production renders its legitimacy very dubious. From its complexion and features it appears to be the brat of some attorney, who durst not father it himself; therefore procured the old sage to act as sponsor. However, as his respectableness has pledged himself for the truth of what is there represented, I shall consider him as the parent, and treat him accordingly. After having pledged himself for the truth of what he represents, he says, �About 5 o�clock on Wednesday afternoon, public notice being given by ringing the bell, etc.� But I would ask his gravity, if a town meeting was called to consult the people, whether they approved of the measure or not? Without this precaution, their public notice was to no purpose. It is unknown to the borough charter, and therefore the intended rejoicers were an unhallowed riotous mob. This impartial spectator has neglected to take notice of a subscription paper that was handed about the same day, binding the subscribers to illuminate their windows, with a menace, that such windows as would not be illuminated should be broken. This was one great cause which induced the people to oppose the rejoicing; and an order of time ought to have been narrated before the ringing of the bell, etc. if the spectator had acted an impartial part; but perhaps the old man was not trusted with the secret; for tho a very good spy, he may be a bad secretary. A man cannot be expected to possess talents suitable to every sphere of life. It is necessary to observe as we go along, that when it was remonstrated to the intended rejoicers, by a number of respectable inhabitants in the most peaceable manner, that their conduct was contrary to the minds of three-fourths of the inhabitants, and must therefore produce bad consequences if they persisted; their reply was, �They would fire the cannon in spite of any who would oppose them; and if they would not clear the way, they would blow them up in the air.� Such imperious language was too grating for the ears of freemen, and produced a short conflict which ended in the total rout of the new Federalists. The old sage further says, �that three gentlemen were appointed to make the necessary arrangements�; in this business they employed a certain John Rinn, and promised him five shillings for his service, but ran away without paying him; to revenge which he collected such of the rabble as the intended rejoicers had gathered together to assist them in hauling the cannon from Mr. Forster�s tavern to the courthouse (but deserted them when they were defeated), and with their assistance burnt the sledge and cannon carriage, contrary to the express prohibition of such of the inhabitants who opposed the rejoicing as were then present. This old man says, �The persons met for the purpose of the celebration were altogether unprepared for such an assault, being even without walking canes.� True, but they had much more formidable weapons, viz., muskets and fixed bayonets and bludgeons, so that all the preparation they wanted was spirit and courage (Major James A. Wilson excepted) for they had weapons, and numbers more than sufficient. He says again, �that loud huzzas were repeated, with damnation to the 46 members, etc.� Here his gravity has pledged himself for a palpable falsehood; for no such words were used as �damnation to the 46 members.� He again adds, �that the friends of government intended on Thursday at 12 o�clock to carry into execution their resolution of rejoicing.� Why the old man cannot be serious! What spirit possessed him, when he called them friends to government? Pray what government do they befriend? They are determined enemies to the government of Pennsylvania, to the Confederation of the United States, and to every government that ever existed in the world (a despotism excepted). The government which they are so enthusiastically fond of is as yet an ideal phantom, a chimera, a mere theory detested and execrated by every true friend to government. He again tells us, �he went to the courthouse, found them armed, chiefly with guns and bayonets, that they discovered every pacific disposition, but at the same time, the most determined resolution to repel at the risk of their lives, any attack which might be made on them.� What a palpable contradiction is this, �they were armed with guns and bayonets� (he ought to have added, they were loaded with powder and musket ball, as has been proven on oath) �determined to repel all who should oppose them at the risk of their lives, and at the same time to discover every pacific disposition.� I appeal to common sense, if they could possibly have discovered a more hostile disposition; however their disposition appeared more pacific upon hearing the militia drum beat. They immediately left the ground, after firing three discharges of cannon; whereas their original declaration was, that if the devil should come from hell to oppose them, they would fire thirteen. Our old man again says, �although the mob made their appearance in several places and used threatening language which was treated with every possible contempt, and no violence offered to them.� Was it not violence to draw a sword, and present a loaded gun and fixed bayonet at an unarmed man, for no other reason, than treating them with a little irony, which it was difficult for any person of a moderate share of vivacity to forbear on this occasion; for the whole transaction had every appearance of a funeral ceremony awkwardly performed, but not the least resemblance of rejoicing. He further tells us, �there are prosecutions about to be commenced in the name of the state, against the persons whom he is pleased to call rioters.� Tis very well to be prepared, but would advise, that the prosecutions be deferred, until the new Federal Constitution is adopted, where they may have a trial at a federal court, without the detestable interference of a jury. He says again, �that every lover of good order must lament the wound, the dignity of the state has received, in burning etc. the effigy of the first magistrate of the commonwealth.� This is the first time I heard of this transaction, I presume it owes its origin to the inventive genius of the old man; for my part I took His Excellency Doctor Franklin to be the first magistrate of the commonwealth; and I never so much as heard a reproachful word spoke of him. But perhaps he meant the Chief Justice, to whom no indignity was offered in his judicial character, but his conduct in the late Convention has given the State a much greater wound, and justly merits the resentment of the People. The old man observes, �it is remarkable that some of the most active people in the riot of Wednesday and the mob of Thursday have come to this country, within these two years, men perfectly unknown and whose characters were too obscure to attract the notice of the inhabitants of this place.� Some of these characters, however, are so obvious as to be noticed with an envious eye, even by the old man himself, and several others of his party, but does the old man think newcomers are to be deprived of their rights as men? But in this his spirit is exactly similar to that of their darling Constitution, which has laid newcomers under many legal disabilities and given all the discourgement that it durst safely do, by empowering Congress to lay a tax of ten dollars on each immigrant. The old man talks of some who opposed the rejoicing, that had but lately stripped off the garb of British soldiers; here he is mistaken again, but I suppose he means the wheelbarrow garb which Rinn, their artillery man, had so lately been stripped of.1 He again exclaims, �proceedings of this kind are really alarming, and directly tend to the dissolution of all government.� Now of all others, the new Federalists ought to be silent about the dissolution of governments, for they professedly avow the dissolution of all governments, and is endeavoring to establish an unheard of monster on their ruins. He tells us further �that being an old man, he was invited to spend the evening with the Federalists (or rather incendiaries) at Mr. Joseph Postlethwait�s tavern.� What! has our impartial spectator degenerated into a palpable partisan, by his own confession at the banquet of wine? However he might have saved himself the trouble of the declaration, as any person who reads his narrative would have easily discerned his cloven foot without the help of spectacles; but it seems he was invited, indeed, it would have been the basest ingratitude of the new Federalists, if they had not invited their faithful spy, who had watched the motions of their opposers with such unwearied assiduity, that day and the preceding evening. I would recommend thus much to the old gentleman (if it is not profanity to call him so) should his vanity prompt him to father another bastard of this kind, to beware of inserting such palpable falsehoods, for mankind has not as yet refined so much upon good breeding as to pass them by unnoticed, out of deference to his antiquated genius. I shall therefore dismiss his gravity, with an old proverb, �old people are twice children.�"
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/10/1788,"Common sense said, that, in case America became an independent nation, neutrality would be a safer convoy than a man of war: Probably Mr. Paine thought so, when he wrote; but if he did he thought wrong: For the position ought to be reversed.�A man of war is a safer convoy than neutrality; or at least, without a naval convoy there is no safety in neutrality. If America is to be a commercial neutral power, she ought to have some naval strength to intitle her to the appellation. We all know that the armed neutrality of the northern European powers injured the trade of Britain more, during the late war, than the combined fleets of her open enemies. If a war should now commence between Britain and France or any of the nations who have possessions in America; can America remain a neutral power, or join in an armed neutrality for the protection of her commerce? No. Neutral she may be, and neutral she must be, and nothing else; and as for her being called a power it is a mere solecism, as long as she has no navy: Her trade may be destroyed [339]with impunity; her seamen taken to man the fleets of her enemies, without the possibility of redress; and her government insulted and her cities laid in ashes by her enemies ships riding triumphant in her rivers and harbours, without being able to help herself, or retaliate. But however necessary a fleet may be for the protection of our seamen, commerce, and national honor, it is pretty plain, that as long as the proposed government would exist, (if ever it should be established) we must do without one; That government must at least for some years be administred by a standing army. Nothing short of despotism can reduce the disaffected part of the people to submit to it, who are the friends to liberty and the rights of human nature. Those who say that its enemies are a few insignificant individuals, talk something like the British ministry at the commencement of the war, who represented the American discontents, as a parcel of cowardly paltroons, whom they would soon bring to obedience, by a handful of military; but a short time convinced them of their mistake. As the spirit of the new constitution admits of a standing army, and the opposition absolutely must be crushed by strength, every nerve of power must be strained, and every way and means of collecting money devised, for raising an efficient army for this purpose, in the first instance. This is a system of procedure that the despots must pursue, if they have any hopes of success. Either moderation or delay would effectually defeat them. I question whether all the hard money, that the well born can procure at this juncture, will be sufficient to support their government and army for six months; without expending a single shilling on building a federal navy. The greater part of that junto are extremely poor; and have their hopes of agrandizement on the new government; now if a part of the people refuse to pay taxes to that government, as they certainly will, how will they provide for the national debt; how will these poor gentlemen make their fortunes; how will they pay their standing army, to whom they owe their existence; a few interogatives of this sort must shew clearly, that a single ship of war will never be built while this great government is in operation. It is generally said, that the present distresses of America are in consequence of the want of the states delegating sufficient powers to congress: This is right in part, for the powers of congress were certainly too limitted to promote the general good of the union; but little power as that body had, they have not managed it well; indeed if they had had any more and the number of members so small, we would have had a tyrannical aristocracy established long ago; and the country involved in more misery. That body never attempted to build a navy; but, on the contrary, to complete our disgrace, sold the only ship of war we had, the Alliance frigate, for a mere song:1 They have found money [340]however, to pay their well born ambassadors at the different European courts, and squandered away money on guilded swords, presents to Baron � �,2 &c. &c. &c. and they have even had credit to negociate loans lately;3 but not a farthing could be spared to employ our poor mechanics to build a few frigates, by which a thousand honest families might have been saved from starving, and prevented from emigrating from the country, and our commerce and national respectability preserved. This is a specimen of the plan of our new system of government. When the present peddling and limited congress have taken such arbitrary steps, so diametrically opposite to the interest of the public good, what may we not expect from the friends of the new constitution? The poor working-man is not to be thought of, except his work will add to the character and dignity of the lordling nobility."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/12/1788,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Fellow Citizens. What illustrious evidence and striking demonstration does the present momentous discussion afford of the inestimable value of the liberty of the press? No doubt now remains, but that it will prove the rock of our political salvation. Despotism, with its innumerable host of evils, by gliding through the mist of deception, had gained some of the principal works, had made a lodgement in the very citadel of liberty before it was discovered, and was near carrying the fortress by surprise: at this imminent alarming crisis the centries from the watch-towers sounded the alarm, and aroused the dormant votaries of liberty to a due sense of their danger; who, with an alacrity and spirit suited to the exigence, answered to the call, repulsed the enemy, dislodged it from most of its acquisitions, and nothing is now wanting to a total rout and compleat defeat, but a general discharge from the artillery of freedom. As the shades of night fly the approach of the radiant sun, so does [361]despotism before the majesty of enlightened truth; wherever free discussion is allowed, this is invariably the consequence. Since the press has been unshackled in Pennsylvania; what an astonishing transition appears in the sentiments of the people! Infatuation is at an end, execration and indignation have succeeded to blind admiration and mistaken enthusiasm. The rampant insolence of the conspirators is prostrated, black dispair has taken possession of many of them, their countenances proclaim their defeat, and express serious apprehension for their personal safety from the rising resentment of injured freemen. James, the Caledonian, lieutenant general of the myrmidons of power, under Robert, the cofferer, who, with his aid du-camp, Gouvero, the cunning man, has taken the field in Virginia;1 I say James, in this exigence, summonses a grand council of his partizans in this city, and represents, in the most pathetic moving language, the deplorable situation of affairs, stimulates them to make a vigorous effort to recover the ground they have lost and establish their empire; that for this purpose, a generous contribution must be made by all those who expect to taste the sweets of power, or share in the fruits of dominion, in order to form a fund adequate to the great design, that may put them in possession of the darling object: then recommends that a committee be appointed of those who are gifted with Machiavelian talents, of those who excel in ingenuity, artifice, sophistry and the refinements of falsehood, who can assume the pleasing appearance of truth and bewilder the people in all the mazes of error; and as the task will be arduous, and requires various abilities and talents, the business ought to be distributed, and different parts assigned to the members of the committee, as they may be respectively qualified; some by ingenious sophisms to explain away and counteract those essays of patriotism that have struck such general conviction; some to manufacture extracts of letters and notes from correspondents, to give the complexion of strength to their cause, by representing the unanimity of all corners of America in favor of the new constitution; and others to write reams of letters to their tools in every direction, furnishing them with the materials of propagating error and deception; in short that this committee ought to make the press groan and the whole country reverberate with their productions. Thus to overpower truth and liberty by the din of empty sound and the delusion of falsehood. The conspirators, deceived by their first success, grounded on the unreserved confidence of the people, do not consider that with the detection of their views, all chance of success is over; that suspicion once awakened, is not so soon to be lulled, but with eagle-eye will penetrate all their wiles, and detect their every scheme, however deeply laid, or speciously glossed. The labours of their committee will be [362]unavailing, the point of deception is passed, the rays of enlightened patriotism have diffused general illumination. However, this new effort will serve to shew the perseverance of ambition and the necessity of constant vigilance in the people for the preservation of their liberty. Already we recognize the ingenuity and industry of this committee; the papers teem with paragraphs, correspondents, &c. that exhibit a picture which bears no resemblance to the original; if we view this mirror for the representation of the sentiments of the people, a perfect harmony seems to prevail, every body in every place are charmed with the new Constitution, consider it as a gift from heaven, as their only salvation, &c. &c. &c. and I am informed expresses are employing to waft the delusion to the remotest corners; such a scene of bustle, lying, and activity, was never exhibited since the days of Adam. The contributions to the grand fund are so great, that it is whispered a magazine of all the apparatus of war is to be immediately provided, and if all other means fail, force is to be recurred to, which they hope will successfully terminate the disagreeable discussion of the rights of mankind, of equal liberty, &c. and thus establish a due subordination to the well born few."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/16/1788,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Fellow-Citizens, The arguments upon which the advocates of the new constitution the most dwell, are the distresses of the community, the evils of anarchy, and the horrible consequences that would ensue from the dissolution of the union of the states, and the institution of separate [387]confederacies or republics: The unanimity of the federal convention, and the sanction of great names, can be no further urged as an argument after the exposition made by the attorney-general of Maryland,2 who was a member of that convention; he has opened such a scene of discord and accommodation of republicanism to despotism as(a) excite the most serious apprehensions in every patriotic mind. The first argument has been noticed in the preceding essays; wherein it is shewn that this is not the criterion whereby to determine the merits of the new constitution; that notwithstanding the reality of the distresses of the people, the new constitution may not only be inadequate as a remedy, but destructive of liberty, and the completion of misery: The remaining two arguments will be discussed in this number; their futility elucidated; and thus the medium of deception being dissipated, the public attention, with undiverted, undiminished force, will be directed to the proper object, will be confined to the consideration of the nature and construction of the plan of government itself, the question will then be, Whether this plan be calculated for our welfare, or misery; whether it is the temple of liberty, or the structure of despotism? and as the former, or the latter, shall appear to be the case, to adopt, or reject it accordingly, otherwise to banish the demon of domination by suitable amendments and qualifications. The evils of anarchy have been pourtrayed with all(b) the imagery of language, in the glowing colours of eloquence; the affrighted mind is thence led to clasp the new constitution as the instrument of deliverance, as the only avenue to safety and happiness: To avoid the possible and transitory evils of one extreme, it is seduced into the certain and permanent misery necessarily attendant on the other. A state of anarchy from its very nature, can never be of long continuance; the greater its violence, the shorter the duration; order and security are immediately sought by the distracted people beneath the shelter of equal laws, and the salutary restraints of regular government; and if this be not attainable, absolute power is assumed by the one, or the few, who shall be the most enterprising and successful. If anarchy, therefore, were the inevitable consequence of rejecting the new constitution, it would be infinitely better to incur it; for even then there would be at least the chance of a good government rising out of licentiousness; but to rush at once into despotism, because there is a bare possibility of anarchy ensuing from the rejection, or from what is yet more visionary, the small delay that would be occasioned by a revision and correction of the proposed system of government, is so superlatively weak, so fatally blind, that it is astonishing any person of common understanding should suffer such an imposition to have the least influence on his judgement;3 still more astonishing, that so flimsy and deceptive a doctrine should make converts among the enlightened freemen of America, who have so long enjoyed the blessings of liberty; [388]but when I view among such converts, men otherwise pre-eminent, it raises a blush for the weakness of humanity, that these her brightest ornaments should be so dim-sighted to what is self-evident to most men, that such imbecility of judgement should appear where so much perfection was looked for; this ought to teach us to depend more on our own judgement and the nature of the case, than upon the opinions of the greatest and best of men, who, from constitutional infirmities, or particular situations may sometimes view an object through a delusive medium; but the opinions of great men are more frequently the dictates of ambition, or private interest.4 The source of the apprehensions of this so much dreaded anarchy would upon investigation be found to arise from the artful suggestions of designing men, and not from a rational possibility(c) grounded on the actual state of affairs; the least reflection is sufficient to detect the fallacy to shew that there is no one circumstance to justify the production(d) of such an event: On the contrary, a short time will evince to the utter dismay and confusion of the conspirators, that a perseverance in cramming down their scheme of power upon the freemen of this state, will inevitably produce an anarchy destructive of their darling domination, and may kindle a flame prejudicial to their safety; they should be cautious not to trespass too far on the forbearance of freemen, when wresting their dearest concerns; but prudently retreat from the gathering storm. The other spectre that has been raised to terrify and alarm the people out of the exercise of their judgement on this great occasion, is the dread of our splitting into separate confederacies or republics, that might become rival powers and consequently liable to mutual wars from the usual motives of contention. This is an event still more improbable than the foregoing; it is a presumption unwarrantable,(e) either by the situation of affairs, or the sentiments of the people; no disposition leading to it exists; the advocates of the new constitution seem to view such a separation with horror, and its opponents are strenuously contending for a confederation that shall embrace all America under its comprehensive and salutary protection. This hobgoblin appears to have sprung from the deranged brain of Publius,5 a New-York writer, who, mistaking sound for argument, has with Herculean labour accumulated myriads of unmeaning sentences, and mechanically endeavored to force conviction by a torrent of misplaced words; he might have spared his readers the fatigue of wading through his long-winded disquisitions on the direful effects of the contentions of inimical states, as totally inapplicable to the subject he was professedly treating; this writer has devoted much time, and wasted more paper in combating chimeras of his own creation: However, for the sake of [389]argument, I will admit, that the necessary consequence of rejecting, or delaying the establishment of the new constitution, would be the dissolution of the union, and the institution of even rival and inimical republics; yet ought such an apprehension, if well founded, to drive us into the fangs of despotism: Infinitely preferable would be occasional wars to such an event; the former, although a severe scourge, is transient in its continuance, and in its operation partial, but a small proportion of the community are exposed to its greatest horrors, and yet fewer experience its greatest evils; the latter is permanent and universal misery, without remission or exemption: as passing clouds obscure for a time the splendour of the sun, so do wars interrupt the welfare of mankind; but despotism is a settled gloom that totally extinguishes happiness, not a ray of comfort can penetrate to cheer the dejected mind; the goad of power with unabating rigor insists upon the utmost exaction, like a merciless task master, is continually inflicting the task,(f) and is never satiated with the feast of unfeeling domination, or the most abject servility. The celebrated Lord Kains(g) whose disquisitions on human nature evidence extraordinary strength of judgement and depth of investigation, says that a continual civil war, which is the most destructive and horrible scene of human discord, is preferable to the uniformity of wretchedness and misery attendant upon despotism;6�of all possible evils, as I observed in my first number,7 this is the worst and the most to be dreaded. I congratulate my fellow-citizens that a good government, the greatest earthly blessing, may be so easily obtained, that our circumstances are so favorable that nothing but the folly of the conspirators can produce anarchy or civil war, which would presently terminate in their destruction and the permanent harmony of the state alone, interrupted by their ambitious machinations. In a former number8 I stated a charge of a very heinous nature, and highly prejudicial to the public welfare, and at this great crisis peculiarly alarming and threatening to liberty; I mean the suppression of the circulation of the newspapers from state to state by the of�c�rs of the P�t-O�ce, who in violation of their duty and integrity have prostituted their of�ces to forward the nefarious design of enslaving their countrymen, by thus cutting off all communication by the usual vehicle between the patriots of America;�I find that notwithstanding that public appeal, they persevere in this villainous and daring practice. The newspapers of the other states that contain any useful information, are still withheld from the printers of this state, and I see by the annunciation of the Editor of Mr. Greenleaf�s patriotic New-York paper, that the printers of that place are still treated in like manner; [390]this informs his readers that but two southern papers have come to hand, and that they contain no information, which he affects to ascribe to the negligence of the p�t boy, not caring to quarrel with the p�t m�t�r g�l.9 Philadelphia, January 12, 1788"
Newspaper,No,Hermenius,,Carlisle Gazette,,1/16/1788,"The Address to the Minority of the State Convention of Pennsylvania, Explained.1 The next day after the address to the minority of the state Convention of Pennsylvania appeared in the Carlisle Gazette, I happened to be in company with a number of respectable and intelligent gentlemen, at least they are generally esteemed so. The subject of their discourse was the address. One asserted that �it was the most bombastical and nonsensical composition he had ever read.� Another affirmed �it was the sublime of nonsense.� Another, �that the person who had composed it was undoubtedly a poor, smattering pedant.� Another declared, �that though he was opposed to the new Federal Constitution, yet he detested that address as a foolish, inconsistent jargon.� However, I was so far from agreeing with these gentlemen in exclaiming against the address, that I esteemed it an excellent composure of the kind; to vindicate this opinion of its merit, the following short remarks are presented to the public, designed principally to explain the most difficult terms and sentences in that performance, that it may not be rashly condemned or misunderstood. By an address in this place, must not be understood an application made by the party addressing to the party addressed, desiring to have something done for them; nor an indication of anything to the party addressed, which ought in a particular manner to be taken into their consideration; though this is the common acceptation of the word. But by this address [655page icon]is meant, a medley composition made up of remarks and assertions upon different and unconnected subjects. The term being explained, the address itself is next to be considered. In the first place, observe that history is assumed as the foundation and standard of the arguments used in the first part of this address; you may take notice also that by history being pregnant is not meant that it is great with young breeding or fruitful, which are the common senses of the word; but only that history informs or makes known what has been. We are informed in the address, �that the successive convulsions that happened at Rome were the immediate consequence� (that is, a consequence that proceeds from its cause, without the intervention of secondary causes or means) �of the aspiring ambition of a few great men,� that is, of the minority of great men, or men in public offices. I say the minority, because history is the standard in this matter; and it informs us that there were many great men in the Roman commonwealth; therefore, these few great men were the minority, who occasioned the successive convulsions of Rome. Again, these �convulsions were the immediate consequence of the very organization and construction of the government itself�; therefore, since there was means, there must have been a continued and uninterrupted convulsion in the Roman state, from the first day that the Roman government was organized and constructed till it was totally erased. Away then with all the fabulous descriptions of the glory, peace, happiness, liberty, and grandeur of the Roman state, that are handed down to us by the historians of all ages since the Roman state first existed; these historians have been ignorant fools and ill-designing blockheads to impose such gross falsehoods upon the world! Falsehoods so glaring, that thirty men in Cumberland County, many centuries after, have detected? The address informs us also that �Venice by the encroachments of her nobles has degenerated into an odious and permanent aristocracy.� But America has no nobles to dread in this respect. Now in the first place, the minority of great men at Rome occasioned their convulsions. Secondly, the organization and construction of the Roman government was not the cause of these convulsions; for then there would have been an uninterrupted convulsion in the Roman state; but history informs us otherwise. Thirdly, the nobles of Venice brought about an odious and permanent aristocracy; therefore, if the new Federal Constitution be similar to the Roman constitution, there will be no danger of convulsions being the immediate consequence of adopting it. And if the convulsions that happened at Rome were the immediate consequence of the aspiring ambition of the few great men, or minority, certainly, from a similarity of causes, similar consequences will happen [to] the Americans, if [656page icon]they should follow their minority; especially, as we shall show afterwards, that they are very probably actuated by the same principles as the minority at Rome were. Again nothing can be proved by the comparison of Venice to America, because there are no nobles in America, and so the causes being dissimilar, the consequences cannot be proved to be similar. We may, indeed, suppose that all the Americans are nobles; but then it would be unreasonable to suppose that they would bring an odious and permanent aristocracy over themselves; therefore, the indubitable demonstration must fall to the ground. The phrases, �fire of liberty� and �the contact of a very spark� are so metaphorically plain and easy to be understood, that I need not explain them, but only to show that the spark is to come into contact with the fire of liberty, and then, �by its direful explosion, it will devour not only the enemies of liberty, but both parties� (that is, both its enemies and friends) �promiscuously.� This is the glorious liberty, tending to the destruction of both its friends and enemies promiscuously, which is so much endangered by the new Federal Constitution! Oppose therefore, O Americans, like freemen! Next, let us observe, that discontent, indignation, and revenge are the principles mentioned in the address, that are visible in every patriotic countenance. Patriotic principles indeed! exactly suited to the defenders of that liberty, or fire of liberty, that will devour both its enemies and friends! Hail happy patriots! Nero, Caligula, Clodius, and Cataline! It was by these patriotic principles you were actuated, when you committed all your outrages, and it was in defense of that liberty, that devours both friends and enemies promiscuously! Eternal disgrace be on Demosthenes, Cicero, Cato, and others who suppressed these patriotic principles, and managed matters of state with justice, benevolence, and clemency! No wonder the addressers have said, �that little less than the lives of their betrayers will satiate their revenge; that nothing but an annihilation of the Federal Constitution will appease the enraged defenders of liberty.� No wonder, indeed, when actuated by the patriotic principles of discontent, indignation, rage, and revenge, in defense of a liberty, that will devour both friends and enemies. �Civil discord already raises her sneaky head.� The public, I hope, will pardon this romantic phrase. The next sentence that needs a little explanation is where the addressers reject the authority of the clergy, with respect to the Federal Constitution, because, �they seem generally to have been a set of men decidedly opposed to popular freedom.� This is to be understood that they are opposers of that freedom and liberty that will devour both its friends and enemies. For with regard to that liberty that is inconsistent with, and tends to promote the mutual interest, advantage, and support of the citizens, [657page icon]all America can testify, that the greater part of the clergy in America have exerted themselves in the support and defense of it. But as this is a species of liberty diametrically opposed to the [one line unreadable] friends and enemies promiscuously, it is not strange that the authority of the clergy is rejected in this case. The addressers very modestly proclaim to the public, that �they are a society united for the express purpose of mutual improvement.� The public are much obliged to them for this information, as it is of great importance to know it. Lastly, by taking notice of the remarks already made in explaining this address, we may easily discern the reasons why the addressers so highly applauded the minority of the late state Convention, and so severely execrate the majority. The minority are esteemed patriots by the addressers; that is, according to their idea of patriotism, men actuated by discontent, indignation, and revenge; and stand in the defense of a liberty, that will devour both its friends and enemies promiscuously; but the majority are for another kind of liberty, and act from different principles. Hoping the public will understand the address better by these remarks, I beg leave to subscribe myself, HERMENIUS."
Newspaper,No,Philanthropos,,Pennsylvania Gazette,,1/16/1788,"To the People of the United States. When we observe how much the several gentlemen of the late Convention, who declined to sign the federal constitution, differ in their ground of opposition, we must see how improbable it is, that another convention would unite in the same degree in any plan. Col. Mason and Mr. Gerry complain of the want of a bill of rights; Governor Randolph does not even mention it as desirable, much less as necessary. Col. Mason objects to the powers of Congress to raise an army; Governor Randolph and Mr. Gerry make no objections on this point, but the former seems to think a militia an inconvenient and uncertain dependence, which is contrary to our opinions in Pennsylvania. Mr. Randolph gives up the objection against the power of Congress to regulate trade by a majority; Mr. Mason complains of this, and says the objection is insuperable; Mr. Gerry does not say a word against it. Mr. Randolph wishes the President ineligible after a given number of years; Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry do not make this one of their objections. Mr. [392page icon]Randolph objects to some ambiguities; Mr. Mason does not. Col. Mason objects to the slave trade on the principles of policy merely; Mr. Gerry and Mr. Randolph make no such objections. Mr. Mason objects to the power of the President to pardon for treason; Mr. Gerry makes no such objection, and Mr. Randolph wishes, only, that the offender may be convicted before the President shall have power to pardon! This appears to be a legal solecism. Mr. Randolph objects to the power of Congress to determine their wages (the privilege of every legislature in the union;) but Mr. Gerry and Col. Mason do not object to this power. Mr. Randolph objects to the President’s power of appointing the judges; Mr. Gerry and Col. Mason do not. Mr. Gerry says the people have no security for the right of election; Col. Mason and Mr. Randolph do not make this objection. Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason think the representation not duly provided for; Mr. Randolph expresses no such idea. Mr. Mason objects to the want of security for the common law, to the power of the senate to alter money bills, to originate applications of money, to regulate the officers salaries, to the want of a privy Council, to the Vice-President, to the want of a clause concerning the press, and to the want of power in the states to lay imposts on exports; not one of which are stated as objections by Mr. Randolph or Mr. Gerry. Mr. Randolph objects to the want of a proper court of impeachment for senators (tho’ the state courts of impeachment can always take cognizance of them;) Mr. Gerry and Col. Mason do not hold this exceptionable. Col. Mason objects to the states, or Congress, being restrained from passing ex post facto laws; Mr. Randolph and Mr. Gerry do not. The minority of the Pennsylvania convention, on the other hand, differ from all these gentlemen. They say, the defects of the old confederation were not discovered till after the peace; while Mr. Randolph says, the short period between the ratification of the old constitution and the peace was distinguished by melancholy testimonies of its defects and faults. The Minority object, because some of the persons appointed by Pennsylvania have disapproved of our state constitution, which differs from those of eleven states in the union in the want of a division of the legislature, and in having nineteen persons to execute the office of governor, whose number will be increased by the addition of one more for every new county. The Minority object to the latitude taken by the convention; we find no such objection made by Mr. Randolph, Mr. Gerry or Col. Mason. Mr. Gerry says, in his letter, it was necessary; and Mr. Mason insisted strongly in the house, that the convention could not do their business, unless they considered and recommended every thing that concerned the interests of the United States, tho’ the strict letter of their powers was supposed by some not to extend so far. The Minority say, religious liberty is not duly secured; which is omitted as an objection by all of the [393page icon]three gentlemen above named. The right of the people to fish, fowl and hunt, the freedom of speech, provision against disarming the people, a declaration of the subordination of the military to the civil power, annual elections of the representatives, and the organization and call of the militia, are considered by the Minority of our convention, as on an exceptionable footing; but none of these are even mentioned by Governor Randolph, Mr. Mason or Mr. Gerry. The Minority desire a declaration, that such powers as are not expresly given shall be considered as retained; Mr. Randolph thinks this unnecessary, for that the states retain every thing they do not grant. Mr. Gerry is silent on this head. The Minority desire a constitutional Council for the President; Mr. Gerry and Mr. Randolph do not. The Minority except against powers to erect a court of equity being vested in the fœderal government; to which neither of the above gentlemen express any dislike. The minority desire a bill of rights, and object to the smallness of the representation; which Mr. Randolph does not. They object to the term of duration of the legislature; which none of the above gentlemen find fault with. Nor does the account of particulars end here. The objections severally made by the three honorable gentlemen and the Pennsylvania Minority are so different, and even discordant in their essential principles, that all hope of greater unanimity of opinion, either in another convention, or in the people, must be given up by those who know the human heart and mind, with their infinitely varying feelings and ideas."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/22/1788,"A correspondent says, that the present situation of public affairs is truly alarming. The minority of the state Convention of Pennsylvania have declared in their protest, that the Continental Convention have no power to annihilate the old Articles of Confederation without the consent of every one of the thirteen states in the Union; that two members of the late Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania were forcibly dragged to the House for the purpose of making a quorum to call a convention, whereby the proceedings of such an Assembly are by no means binding upon the people; and that the constitution of the State of Pennsylvania cannot be set aside although nine states should agree to the ratification of the new Constitution. In these opinions they are supported not only by their constituents but by a very considerable part of the whole body of the people of Pennsylvania, who, it is expected, will soon confederate under these sentiments. It would be the part therefore of wisdom in some of the states who have not yet adopted the new Constitution, to pause a while before they proceed to the ratification of it. A civil war with all its dreadful train of evils will probably be the consequence of such a proceeding. Whereas, if we have patience, we may at more convenient opportunity determine upon some alteration in government which will be peaceably adopted by the people."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,1/23/1788,"�This is true liberty; when freeborn men, Having to advise the public, may speak free; Which he who can, and will, deserves high praise; Who neither can, nor will, may hold his peace� What can be juster in a state than this?�2 Hail, immortal genius!�hail, thou friend of freedom, and of thy fellow-men, whose patriotic pen first wrote this divine sentiment, �Let it be impressed upon your minds, let it be instilled into your children, that the liberty of the press is the palladium of all civil, political and religious rights of freemen.�3 This is the scourge of tyrants, oppressors, villains, and blood-suckers; the bulwark of freedom, that causes the haughtiest lordling to tremble; an inestimable jewel, that places the [459]poorest citizen on a level with the richest demagogue. In America the freedom of the press is peculiarly interesting: to a people scattered over such a vast continent, what means of information or redress have they, when a conspiracy has been formed against their sacred rights and privileges? None but the press. This is the herald that sounds the alarm, and rouses freemen to guard their liberty. From this scourge, the parricide, the knave of power and his cringing sycophants have every thing to fear; it hurls fury on the guilty heads of such base characters, and drags them to the public altar�And through the medium of the press, the good and the patriotic citizen receives the thanks of his grateful countrymen. The sons of freedom who framed the constitution of Pennsylvania, expresly declared this to be one of the unalienable rights of the people, and therefore it ought not to be restrained.4 That some evils attend an unrestrained press, is obvious; but these are infinitely overbalanced by its advantages. The very salvation of America. I trust, will be wrought out by it; and the conspirators be taken by their own snares, which they so artfully set to seize the liberties of their fellow citizens, to their extreme mortification and disgrace. In my first number, I took notice of some attempts, made by some of the well born or their parasites, to destroy the freedom of the press. A scheme was then proposed, that every writer, for or against the constitution, should leave his name with the printer, to be published if required. This plan was first set on foot in Boston, and adopted by some of the printers there;5 in consequence of which, a gentleman under the signature of A Pennsylvania Mechanic, recommends a similar conduct to the printers of Philadelphia�And a few days after, another, under the signature of Galba6, carries the system something higher; for he must have the villains only who wrote against the new government to leave their names for publication, while the patriotic gentlemen who wrote in favour of it, might walk at large. Either through my reply, the terrors of a guilty conscience, or probably both, we heard no more of these press-fettering gentlemen until Monday last, when a writer in the Independent Gazetteer, under the signature of One of the whigs of 1776.7 comes forth with an improvement upon the original plan. As he says �he has been bred a mechanic,� I conceive he is the identical Pennsylvania Mechanic, who, we formerly observed, must be a blacksmith, employed in the service of the well born to construct chains for confining to perpetual slavery the rest of his fellow-citizens. As his method of obtaining the names of the patriotic writers is tolerably clever, it deserves our particular notice. He says that he has left his name with the printer, and hopes the opposite writers will have no objections to do the same, to the end that he may have a private interview with them, and probably they may then make a [460]convert of him. This is a pretty decent kind of a trap of the blacksmith�s construction; but let him recollect the old proverb, There is no catching old birds with chaff; and then, I think, he will soon find that his interviews and conversions are rather visionary. Tyrannical men are generally cunning, and hence they use deceitful arguments, with all the appearance of plausible equality. The author of a piece, say they, ought to give his name, for no man should write what he is ashamed to own. There is an appearance of candour in this argument, which renders it dangerous; but if we consider the thing more attentively, we shall find, that such a system would be subversive of truth and free enquiry, and eventually annihilate the freedom of the press. When a political writer gives his name with his piece, he then shews where the opposite party may aim their shafts of malice, falshood, and scurrility, with certainty and success. Will a man, for his own sake�or if he has friends, family and endearing connections in life, still more for their sake; venture to expose his interest, his property, and perhaps his life, to the mercy of a revengeful, and probably a powerful party? He certainly will not, if he has common sense; and yet if he gives his name, this would necessarily be the consequence�All investigation of the subject would cease; the whole attention would be drawn off to another object; reason and argument must give place to personal invective and scurrility. When a person writes upon a national subject, he appeals to the public, who have nothing to do with the man himself, but with his sentiments: If his arguments and illustrations are well founded, they ought by all means to be published, as they tend to promote the general good; but if they are of a false or dangerous nature, let them be refuted. The friends of the new constitution have used every method and device, that their power, their cunning, or their influence could have access to, in order to restrain the liberty of the press respecting that despotic scheme of government; but to their confusion be it remembered, that there were printers in Philadelphia beyond their influence or corruption: No city in the Union has afforded such illustrious instances of independence and patriotism among printers. While such a noble spirit exists among these men, there is little danger of the new government ever being established. The despots and their parasites are well aware, that if they could restrain the freedom of the press, all would be their own; hence they have pursued the object with unremitting zeal, and have in some measure succeeded. They have, I am told, by threats and by withdrawing subscriptions, stopt the publication of the debates of the Convention in the Pennsylvania Herald, and otherwise injured that paper so far, that the printer must cease publishing.8 If such conduct as this be not sufficient to rouse the [461]people of America to a sense of their duty, they must become the scorn of the whole world�a mere bye-word of contempt. The advocates of this government say, that if nine states come into it, they will proceed to organize and put it in operation. They hug themselves up in the idea, that its enemies will cease their opposition and submit peaceably. How they came to make such a silly conclusion, is to me matter of surprise, as I never have observed the smallest change of sentiment among the patriotic gentlemen with whom I have conversed. From some of the writings of its friends, it seems probable, that this idea sprang from the circumstance of the Declaration of Independence. That measure was carried by a bare majority in some of the states, yet the minority gave way and joined cordially in it.�If there were any similarity between the circumstances of the Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the proposed Constitution, this argument would have some weight; but the premises are widely different, and consequently the inference inconclusive. The whole body of the people were determined to defend their liberties, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, against the tyranny of the British government; so that there was a union of sentiment in respect of the great object, the only difference was in the means of obtaining it; in this case, then, common sense must have pointed out the expediency of the minority accommodating their private sentiments to those of the majority. But the matter now in debate has no relation to that: the men opposed to the new constitution have the same cause to defend, that the people of America had during the period of a seven years war. Who is he so base, that will peaceably submit to a government that will eventually destroy his sacred rights and privileges? The liberty of conscience, the liberty of the press, the liberty of trial by jury, &c. must lie at the mercy of a few despots�an infernal junto, that are for changing our free republican government into a tyrannical and absolute monarchy. These are what roused the sons of America to oppose Britain, and from the nature of things, they must have a similar effect now."
Newspaper,No,The Scourge,,Carlisle Gazette,,1/23/1788,"JUDGES.�3, Chap.�21, v.�And Ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly, verse 22, and the dirt came out�My father chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions. First Kings. 19th Chap. 11th V. The various and repeated defeats which that party who arrogates to themselves the appellation of federalists has received from the friends of liberty in Carlisle has almost tortured their souls to distraction; many schemes of revenge has been devised which have proved unsuccessful�Immediately after their last attempt to rejoice was baffled, they betook themselves to law for revenge; as this was their native region (some of the principal partizans being attornies) they assured themselves of an easy victory, and solaced their ravenous souls with an ample and speedy glut of revenge; threats, menaces and awful denounciations was now issued out; nothing less than gaols, dungeons, [686]chains and fetters, were to be the portion of their adversaries, but their bravadoes were all visionary, their dastardly souls shrunk back into their own native cowardice, and their sanguinary hopes of vengeance was again disappointed. They then betook themselves to scribbling; here again they promised themselves the advantage, having the learned professions on their side, and by the help of their invention they fabricated a system of falshood and misrepresentations, and procured an old man whom they before employed as a spy to father them, which they published in the Carlisle Gazette; this provoked one of the people to draw forth the dagger of truth and thrust it into their bellies, which had the very effect he expected, and which naturally results from such causes, viz. the dirt came out. I don�t undertake the disagreeable task of wading through such heaps of putrid matter from any design to point forth their nauseous qualities to the public; to suppose they needed this, would be an insult upon their understanding, but I am a pationate friend to liberty which makes me delight in tormenting tyrants; I must therefore give the dagger another thrust, for there is more dirt yet. The authors of the piece signed, another of the people, conscious that reason and truth detested their cause like the rest of their new federal brethren, betake themselves to personal slander, defamation and detraction, in order to vent their spleen and emit their disappointed malice: after a most virulent declamation by way of introduction they exclaim that �their piece is not the work of an attorney,� in this I grant they have justly corrected one of the people, perhaps it is not the work of one attorney, I will believe it employed the heads of all the attorneys then in town, and all the auxiliaries they could procure to compose it; and it certainly does honour to their literary acquisitions. They may without presumption vie with a Solon, a Lycurgus, a Montesquieu or an Adams; they add �nor of needy obscure and starving adventurers whose precarious freedom depends on the nod of their numerous creditors;� it is evident this alludes to the new-incomers; large quantities of dirt of the same kind is disgorged in other places�they say, that �they are men equally void of credit, character or understanding;� and again, that �the old man would scarcely wish to barter an unembarrassed situation for poverty.� By all these dirty and malicious hints, it is evident that the old man and his party, envies the rising consequence of the new-incomers, notwithstanding they affect to deny it; for it is manifest that such of the new-incomers as is here pointed at, is in much better credit than many of their malicious adversaries, whose credit would not permit them to appear in Philadelphia this fall (Some of them has not gone down these nine, twelve and eighteen months, and some of their greatest nabobs these two years; we would [687]despise mentioning such circumstances, were it not to contrast these unembarrassed characters with those whom they are pleased to represent as needy, starving adventurers, &c.) least they should have a disagreeable interview with some of their �numerous creditors.� Who rose from a state of insignificancy and contempt to an appearance of affluence, at the expence of the public, and retains that appearance at the nod of �their numerous creditors.� I wish the public to examine into the truth of these facts, and then say who has reason to boast of an unembarrassed situation. They further add, �nor of a man who lives in violation of every divine precept and moral duty;� perhaps the authors of the old man�s adopted brat may be very pious men for ought I know, but if they are, they have certainly sworn to conceal it from the rest of mankind, but men differ in opinion about religious as well as civil matters, perhaps they account it divine precepts and moral duties, to print falshoods, threaten the lives of their neighbours, go to church once or twice of a Sunday to hear a solemn lecture on politics, blended with geography and astronomy, and interspersed with a few religious hints, and spend the remainder of the day in sacrificing to Bacchus; but it is evident this pious parade is not so much intended to embellish their own character as it is to defame that of another man�s, but as his character is established in Pennsylvania infinitely above the reach of their malicious insinuations, and as Cumberland county hath already given demonstration to the world that they esteem him a better man than any of their fraternity; I shall therefore leave the public indignation to be their scourge; and only observe, that it is evident the dagger has made a large orrifice when such large quantities of dirt comes out. Yet notwithstanding this great fluxion there is more dirt yet. The next passage that represents itself is of the same diabolical nature, they say, �nor of one who basely deserted a constitution which he approved by an uplifted hand in a town meeting, and who under the smile of complacency and benevolence conceals a black and most treacherous heart, and under the specious mantle of religion covers a most depraved mind, &c.� It is really astonishing the distracted frenzy that disappointed rage will drive men to. One man they stigmatize as a violator of every divine precept, &c. because he does not make a specious profession of religion�another they brand with detestable hypocrisy because he makes a profession of religion, and practices the duties thereof too, with much more uprightness, at least to human appearance (and we can judge no further) than any of his calumniators can pretend to; but the more good qualities he possesses the more obnoxious he is to their envenomed malevolence; they hate him because he is a man of honesty and integrity, and dare think for himself, [688]and avow his principles; would he prostitute his understanding to act the deceitful Parisite; the cringing tool, or fawning minion to our pretended quality. He would with the greatest alacrity be admitted �into the councils of the great,� but his magnanimous soul disdains such servile disimulation. They talk of a well dressed man wrestling with a chimney sweep; this is the comparison they draw between themselves and the people. Candid public: these are the men who endeavour by fraud and force, to cram down your throats a constitution which would immediately create them your rulers; they here present you with a small specimen of what treatment you may expect when their favourite constitution becomes �the supreme law of the land.� The most contemptuous and degrading epithets, is given to all such as are not of their faction; no better names than �rabble, mob, chimney sweeps, ragamuffins, vile, contemptible, senseless, ignorant, suited only by nature to a state of insignificance and contempt, is conferred on such citizens as oppose the ambitious views of this imperious junto�Rouse then my fellow citizens before it be too late; act with a spirit becoming freemen; convince the world and your adversaries to, who wish to become your tyrants�That you are not insensible of the invaluable blessings of liberty�That you esteem life and property, but secondary objects; when your liberty comes to be attacked. Teach these domineering despots who wish to rejoice, because they have a prospect of rioting on your spoils; that you perceive their designs, that you can both read and understand their constitution, & spurn it with contempt. They make a flourish about deserting [John] Rinn, and pray who deserted him. It is a certain fact that he was released from his chains at the request and intercession of our new federalists; that one of their champanions brought his pardon from Philadelphia,�That they hired him for five shillings to assist them, his good friends and benefactors, in carrying on their rejoicing; that they deserted him without paying him his wages, and that he, unmindful of recent favours, gratified his revenge by burning their hackney sled, and the cannon carriage. May it not then be retorted on them with the strictest propriety, �for shame! for shame! Do not act so ungratefully by your worthy friend, for whom you had so lately discovered such a kindness by procuring for him his dear bought liberty, his valiant and faithfull services in your cause, (for which you never paid him), deserve a better return; pray then do not disown your guide and Captain of Artillery. [I understand the passage in their first piece �that some who opposed the rejoicing, had but lately stripped of the garb of British soldiers,� is pointed to a certain gentleman who belonged to a Volunteer Company in Ireland. (Men who bravely espoused the cause of liberty in their own country; nor will [689]they desert it here). The gentleman alluded to, challenges the Poother Anatomy who circulated the insidious falshood of a British soldier, to step forth and prove the assertion, otherwise he will be looked on with contempt, and treated accordingly. If his Pootership declines this reasonable demand, he may expect the public will consider him what he really is, a blazing meteor, or mere sky-rocket; but as the public are already in full possession of his [� � �] faculty, and as he has formerly given a specimen of his vindictive, slanderous disposition, I shall dismiss him at present with wishing nothing worse to befal him, than he procured lately to a man of principles much superior to himself]; this would be adding the crime of ingratitude to that of lying, defaming and cheating the hireling of his wages.� It is denied by them that the rejoicers had muskets, bayonets and bludgeons at the time of their rout, I know not what they had at the time of their rout, perhaps they threw them away that they might not incumber them in their flight; but that they had them immediately before their rout is a fact given in testimony, where no party riden lawyers were admitted as inquisitors, nor was the truth partly heard, and partly stifled, but the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth was required and stated with the utmost precision; neither was self-accusation extorted from the simple and ignorant, by terror and menace, so that any person who may be solicitous to ascertain a true state of facts, may have information from other depositions besides those in the �upright magistrates� inquisition; upright indeed! rather the dupe and creature of a domineering faction. They affirm �the drum of the mob had not beat until the federalists left the ground,� the drum of the mob was their own drum, but if they mean the people�s drum it is a palpable falsehood; it can be proven by more than fifty witnesses, that the people�s drum beat around two squares before they (the federalists) left the ground.�They seem to be mightily chagrined at calling the intended rejoicers a mob, but why so much offended, they were only acting in unison with their new federal brethren in the city, whose conduct they [have?] [most?] cordially approved [and?] chearfully recognized the authority of the mob in Philadelphia, who broke open private houses, and dragged two of the members through the streets to the State-House, and then guarded the Assembly while they were passing the resolutions for calling the state convention.2 The midnight mob headed by Jemey the Caledonian [James Wilson], who attacked the lodgings of the western members of Assembly and Council, on the night of the elections for convention men, was an upright, orderly association, and highly servicable to the federal junto. The mob who insulted the western members, when advocating the rights of the people in convention, was of great [690]utility, as they served to keep the members who were advocates for the proposed constitution, &c. in countenance when reason and argument had deserted them3�In a word were it not for the mob the new constitution would not yet have been adopted in Pennsylvania; and our Carlisle rejoicers would have wanted this cause �to be pleased,� and to assemble in a mobocratical manner, to express that pleasure. They further say �one of the captains had not slept off his night�s drunkenness;� what more dirt yet, will the fluxion never cease. It is notoriously known that the person here alluded to, maintains a character the very reverse of what they represent; and that his opposition to the rejoicing, proceeded from that love of freedom which stimulated him, to expose himself to perils and dangers, during the late struggle for American independence; when their old man, and other ringleaders of these pretended federalists, basely sculked behind the curtain. They say, �the other was unfit to appear as he had provoked a federalist, to bung his eyes on Wednesday evening;� I expected shame would have deterred them from mentioning falsehood, as the federalist carryed the bung [for?] one of his eyes to the sham rejoicing [that?] day; and although the order appeared publickly, no such thing was to be [� � �] but every thing combines to prove �the dirt came out.� The passage in one of the people, which says, �that the rejoicers had weapons and numbers more than sufficient,� seems to give the dagger a violent thrust, and consequently draws forth a great eruption of dirt; they endeavour to represent it as an inconsistency with the passage, which says, �the rejoicing was contrary to the minds of three fourths of the inhabitants;� but I would wish to know where the inconsistency lies; might not three fourths of the inhabitants be against the rejoicing, and yet not one eighth of them be on the spot to oppose it; very few of the inhabitants knew any thing of the rejoicing, (the spunging club at the glimmering attorney�s excepted), until it was ripe for execution; so that only a few who catched the report by chance, were on the ground to oppose it. They say, �that some of the new comers are respectable characters, and reprobate the conduct of their apostate countrymen.� Yes! such of them as are under petticoat government which is certainly a very respectable situation; I think those who submit to it, may be pretty easy what constitution is the �supreme law of the land.� They say �the threat in the concluding paragraph is the most despicable; they knew or might have known the authors by applying to the printers.� What! is it granted that the old man was not the author, then it seems, one of the people was right in his conjecture, that the piece was a bastard, and the old man only the adopting father, or rather grand-father.�Gentlemen, apply your own proverb, �lyers should have good memories,� applying to the printers for the [691]authors names we detest. We know it is the practice of our despotic opponents; but we contend for a free press, and abhor every thing that has the least tendency to shackle it. Neither do we employ pimps and spies to catch what intelligence they can, by obtruding themselves upon companies, where their presence is as disagreeable and surfeiting as the fluxion of dirt which is emitted by the authors of another of the people. Thus I have so far dissected this putrid carcase, were I to take notice of all the dirt which it contains, I must transcribe the whole; but this is a task by far too laborious, disagreeable and nauseous.�Other persons pointed at will therefore excuse me, if I omit saying any thing in their behalf; it greatly accelerates our business in this affair, that we have the good-will, faith, and credit of the country on our side. We are struggling for their rights and liberties, as well as our own; which entitles us at least to their approbation, and (to the mortification of our adversaries), we have it in the most [line unreadable] course with the following new song, entitled, The FEDERAL JOY, to the tune of Alexander, hated thinking. I. AWAKE my muse in copious numbers, Sing the federal joy compleat, The loud huzzas the cannon thunders Announce their triumphs to be great. II. Behold they march with curls flying, Weary steps, and powdered heads, Soften�d hands, with eyes espying Crowds of whigs assembled. III. But see they halt, & now are forming Regular as veteran bands, Breathing defiance, scoffing, scorning, The low opposers of their plans. IV. But now a crew for constitution, Harshly then began to treat them, Despising federal institution, Nor aw�d by powder or pomatum. V. From words to blows, those vile aggressors, Rudely drove our harmless band, Despoil�d the work of their hair-dressers, Daring assumed the chief command. VI. Now helter skelter in disorder, Flew our heroes to their homes, Happy their legs were in good order, To save from geting broken bones. VII. Lawyers, doctors and store-keepers, Forsook their general in his need. And from their windows began peeping Viewing their valliant hero bleed. VIII. But like veterans in the morning, Appear�d in arms bright array, Revenge, Revenge, they cry�d when forming We ne�er again will run away. IX. Full thirteen rounds for federal honor Shall thunder loud, tho� hell oppose; Display our new terrific banner, To intimidate our scurvy foes. X. Undauntedly three rounds they fir�d, When lo a drum, most dreadful sound Awak�d new fears, courage retir�d, Paleness in every face was found. XI. Again their shanks were put in motion, With rapid strides they homewards stretches, Or to avoid another portion, Or s - - t a second pair of breeches. XII. And now the pannic being over, When not afraid of club or rope, Descends to law for to recover Money for to purchase soap. XIII. But not a souse for all their swearing, Tho� shirt and breeches both were foul�d; Liberties sons are presevering, Nor will by fed�rals be controul�d. XIV. And if those harpies seek preferment Thro� their countries streaming blood, They�ll dig graves for their interment, Or smother in the purple flood."
Letter,No,John Jordan,John Nicholson,,,1/26/1788,"I received the petitions you sent me. I delivered the packets to the persons they were directed to. The petitions is signing very fast. [693]The new Constitution has a great many cordial enemies in this place. We sent down a state of facts respecting the affray that happened here on the 26th�27th of December last to be published in the Philadelphia papers but have received no certain intelligence whether it was done or not.2 Our opponents who intended to rejoice, but was prevented, stated the facts in their way which we heard was published in Philadelphia.3 In one of the enclosed newspapers, viz., that of the 9th January, you will see an answer to them signed One of the People.4 In the paper of 16th, you�ll see their reply signed Another of the People.5 In the 23, our answer concluded with a song, signed The Scourge.6 We wish to have them published in the city [Philadelphia] as it will show the public the spirit of opposition that takes place here against the Constitution. I could wish you would be so good as [to] send up a few papers with them when printed. The subscription paper for printing, which I have sent you thinking perhaps you would get a few subscribers in the city.7 I think it would be a pity that it should not be published. The author is the same who wrote our pieces in the papers. It will cost a good deal to have it printed and our friends here is not of the richest sort. I really think the piece might be of use, however, exercise your own judgment, but please to write me immediately whether you think proper to apply for subscribers or not. I would have sent the manuscript but it could not be spared. The Address to the Minority was voted a considerable time ago and was originally intended to be published in the Carlisle Gazette but the late commotions breaking out about that time prevented it, and we have since agreed to have it rather published in the city.8 I am requested to solicit you to have it published in as many papers as you conveniently can. We have it in contemplation to appoint a committee here to correspond with the committee in Philadelphia and other places. We wish to have intelligence from time to time what measures you think most advisable to break this formidable conspiracy. We are determined here to do everything in our power to retain that liberty without which life is not worth the enjoying. Our adversaries leave no method untried to break our spirit. They, in a particular manner, have endeavored to wreak their vengeance on me, but I regard them not. I understand they have sent an anonymous letter to Council setting forth that I headed a mob at the courthouse.9 This is such a malicious falsehood as I thought none that retained the least regard to veracity or shame would have dared to assert. During the whole affray I was sitting in my own house drinking a dish of tea when being solicited to go and try if I could not do something to stop the quarrel. I went, but found the people quiet, peaceable, and without interfering, less or more, I returned home again. Notwithstanding I never considered the citizens who opposed the rejoicing [694]a mob, but rather the rejoicers, as you will see by the enclosed newspapers and as depositions now in my hands prove. I could wish you would particularly send up some papers with the address by some careful person direct for the [� � �] to W[illia]m Blair, Sr., W[illia]m Brown, or myself.

Newspaper,No,John Wilkes,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/26/1788,"One may venture to affirm, that all honest and disinterested Americans, of what party soever, if they understood one another, are of the same opinion in points of government and that the great body of the people who had been imposed upon by terms, which they did not comprehend, are all real federalists, are all desirous of living under a free federal government, established on solid republican principles. And were the case truly and faithfully laid before those mistaken persons, who from honest motives, are still friends to the proposed constitution, (and who are falsely called federalists) they would know that when they make a profession of friendship towards it, they renounce their legal claim to liberty and property, and unwarily submit to what they really abhor—a despotic government."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/26/1788,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Fellow-Citizens, Conscious guilt has taken the alarm, thrown out the signal of distress, and even appealed to the generosity of patriotism. The authors and abettors of the new constitution shudder at the term conspirators being applied to them, as it designates their true character, and seems prophetic of the catastrophe: they read their fate in the epithet.2 In dispair they are weakly endeavouring to screen their criminality by interposing the shield of the virtues of a Washington, in representing [447]his concurrence in the proposed system of government, as evidence of the purity of their intentions; but this impotent attempt to degrade the brightest ornament of his country to a base level with themselves, will be considered as an aggravation of their treason, and an insult on the good sense of the people, who have too much discernment not to make a just discrimination between the honest mistaken zeal of the patriot, and the flagitious machinations of an ambitious junto, and will resent the imposition that Machiavelian arts and consummate cunning have practised upon our illustrious chief. The term conspirators was not, as has been alledged, rashly or inconsiderately adopted; it is the language of dispassionate and deliberate reason, influenced by the purest patriotism: the consideration of the nature and construction of the new constitution naturally suggests the epithet; its justness is strikingly illustrated by the conduct of the patrons of this plan of government, but if any doubt had remained whether this epithet is merited, it is now removed by the very uneasiness it occasions; this is a confirmation of its propriety. Innocence would have nothing to dread from such a stigma, but would triumph over the shafts of malice. The conduct of men is the best clue to their principles. The system of deception that has been practised; the constant solicitude shewn to prevent information diffusing its salutary light, are evidence of a conspiracy beyond the arts of sophistry to palliate, or the ingenuity of falsehood to invalidate: the means practised to establish the new constitution are demonstrative of the principles and designs of its authors and abettors. At the time, says Mr. Martin (deputy from the state of Maryland in the general convention) when the public prints were announcing our perfect unanimity, discord prevailed to such a degree, that the minority were upon the point of appealing to the public against the machinations of ambition.3 By such a base imposition, repeated in every newspaper and reverberated from one end of the union to the other, was the people lulled into a false confidence, into an implicit reliance upon the wisdom and patriotism of the convention; and when ambition, by her deceptive wiles, had succeeded to usher forth the new system of government with apparent unanimity of sentiment, the public delusion was compleat. The most extravagant fictions were palmed upon the people, the seal of divinity was even ascribed to the new constitution;4 a felicity more than human was to ensue from its establishment�overlooking the real cause of our difficulties and burthens, which have their proper remedy, the people were taught that the new constitution would prove a mine of wealth and prosperity equal to every want, or the most sanguine desire; that it would effect what can only be produced by the exertion of industry and the practice of economy. The conspirators, aware of the danger of delay, that allowing time for a rational investigation would prove fatal to their designs, precipitated the establishment of the new constitution with all possible celerity; in Massachusetts the deputies of that convention, who are to give the final fiat in behalf of that great state to a measure upon which their dearest concerns depend, were elected by express in the first moments of blind enthusiasm;5 similar conduct has prevailed in the other states as far as circumstances permitted. If the foregoing circumstances did not prove a conspiracy, there are others that must strike conviction in the most unsuspicious. Attempts to prevent discussion by shackling the press ought ever to be a signal of alarm to freemen, and considered as an annunciation of meditated tyranny; this is a truth that the uniform experience of mankind has established beyond the possibility of doubt. Bring the conduct of the authors and abettors of the new constitution to this test, let this be the criterion of their criminality, and every patriotic mind must unite in branding them with the stigma of conspirators against the public liberties.�No stage of this business but what has been marked with every exertion of influence and device of ambition to suppress information and intimidate public discussion; the virtue and firmness of some of the printers, rose superior to the menaces of violence, and the lucre of private interest; when every means failed to shackle the press, the free and independent papers were attempted to be demolished by withdrawing all the subscriptions to them within the sphere of the influence of the conspirators; fortunately for the cause of liberty and truth, these daring high handed attempts have failed except in one instance, where from a peculiarity of circumstances, ambition has triumphed. Under the flimsey pretence of vindicating the character of a contemptible drudge of party rendered ridiculous by his superlative folly in the late convention, of which the statement given in the Pennsylvania Herald, was confessedly a faithful representation,6 this newspaper has been silenced(a) by some hundreds of its subscribers (who it seems are generally among the devoted tools of party, or those who are obliged from their thraldom to yield implicit assent to the mandates of the junto) withdrawing their support from it; by this stroke the conspirators have suppressed the publication of the most valuable debates of the late convention, which would have been given in course by the Editor of that paper, whose stipend now ceasing, he cannot afford without compensation the time and attention necessary to this business.7 Every patriotic person who had an opportunity of hearing that illustrious advocate of liberty and his country, Mr. Findley,8 must sensibly regret that his powerful arguments are not to extend beyond [449]the confined walls of the State-House, where they could have so limitted an effect; that the United States could not have been his auditory through the medium of the press. I anticipate the answer of the conspirators; they will tell you that this could not be their motive for silencing this paper, as the whole of the debates were taken down in short hand by another person and published,9 but the public are not to be so easily duped, they will not receive a spurious as an equivalent for a genuine production; equal solicitude was expressed for the publication of the former as for the suppression of the latter�the public will judge of the motives. That investigation into the nature and construction of the new constitution, which the conspirators have so long and zealously struggled against, has, notwithstanding their partial success, so far taken place as to ascertain the enormity of their criminality. That system which was pompously displayed as the perfection of government, proves upon examination to be the most odious system of tyranny that was ever projected, a many headed hydra of despotism, whose complicated and various evils would be infinitely more oppressive and afflictive than the scourge of any single tyrant: the objects of dominion would be tortured to gratify the calls of ambition and cravings of power, of rival despots contending for the sceptre of superiority; the devoted people would experience a distraction of misery. No wonder then that such a discovery should excite uneasy apprehensions in the minds of the conspirators, for such an attempt against the public liberties is unprecedented in history, it is a crime of the blackest dye, as it strikes at the happiness of millions and the dignity of human nature, as it was intended to deprive the inhabitants of so large a portion of the globe of the choicest blessing of life and the oppressed of all nations of an asylum. The explicit language of the Centinel during the empire of delusion was not congenial to the feelings of the people, but truth when it has free scope is all powerful, it enforces conviction in the most prejudiced mind; he foresaw the consequence of an exertion of the good sense and understanding of the people, and predicted the defeat of the measure he ventured to attack, when it was deemed sacred by most men and the certain ruin of any who should dare to lisp a word against it: he has persevered th[r]ough every discouraging appearance, and has now the satisfaction to find his countrymen are aware of their danger and are taking measures for their security. Since writing the foregoing, I am informed that the Printer of the Pennsylvania Herald is not quite decided whether he will drop his paper; he wishes, and perhaps will be enabled, to persevere;10�however, [450] the conspirators have effected their purpose; the editor is dismissed and the debates of the convention thereby suppressed."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,1/30/1788,"To the People of Pennsylvania. Fellow-Citizens, The conspirators are putting your good sense, patriotism and spirit to the severest test. So bold a game of deception, so decisive a stroke for despotic power, was never before attempted among enlightened freemen. Can there be apathy so indifferent as not to be rouzed into indignation, or prejudice so blind, as not to yield to the glaring evidence of a flagitious conspiracy against the public liberties! The audacious and high-handed measures practised to suppress information, and intimidate discussion, would in any other circumstances than the present, have kindled a flame fatal to such daring invaders of our dearest privileges. The conspirators having been severely galled and checked in their career by the artillery of freedom, have made more vigorous and successful efforts to silence her batteries, while falsehood with all her delusions is making new and greater exertions in favor of ambition. On the one hand, every avenue to information is as far as possible cut off, the usual communication between the states through the medium of the press, is in a great measure destroyed by a new arrangement at the Post-Office, scarcely a newspaper is suffered to pass(a) by this conveyance,2 and the arguments of a Findley, a Whitehill and a Smilie, that bright constellation of patriots are suppressed, and a spurious publication substituted;3 and on the other hand the select committee are assiduously employed in manufacturing deception in all its ensnaring colours, and having an adequate fund at their command, they are deluging the country with their productions.4 The only newspaper that circulates extensively out of the city is kept running over with deceptive inventions.5 Doctor Puff6 the paragraphist, has scarcely slept since his appointment, having received orders to work double tides; beneath his creative pen thousands of correspondents rise into view, who all harmonize in their sentiments and information about the new-constitution; but the chief reliance is on James the Caledonian,7 who can to appearance distroy all distinction between liberty and despotism, and make the latter pass for the former, who can bewilder truth in all the mazes of sophistry, and render the plainest propositions problematical�He cameleon-like can vary his appearance at pleasure, and assume any character for the purposes of deception. In the guise of a Conciliator, in the Independent Gazetteer, he professes great candour and moderation, admits some of the principal objections to the new constitution to be well founded, and insidiously proposes a method to remove them, which is to consider the first Congress under the new constitution as a convention, competent to supply all defects in the system of government.8 This is really a discovery that does honor to [506]his invention. What! a legislative declaration or law a basis upon which to rest our dearest liberties. Does he suppose the people have so little penetration as not to see through so flimsey a delusion, that such a security would amount to no more than the will and pleasure of their rulers, who might repeal this fundamental sanction whenever ambition stimulated?�in the feigned character of a freeman, he combats the weighty arguments of the minority of the late convention, by a meer play upon words, carefully avoiding the real merits of the question;9 and we moreover trace him in a variety of miscellaneous productions in every shape and form, he occasionally assists Doctor Puff in the fabrication of extracts of letters, paragraphs, correspondents, &c. &c. So gifted and with such a claim of merit from his extraordinary and unwearied exertions in the cause of despotism, who so suitable or deserving of the office of Chief Justice of the United States. How congenial would such a post be to the principles and disposition of James! Here he would be both Judge and jury, sovereign arbiter in law and equity. In this capacity he may satiate his vengeance on patriotism for the opposition given to his projects of dominion: Here he may gratify his superlative arrogance and contempt of mankind, by trampelling upon his fellow creatures with impunity; here he may give the finishing stroke to liberty, and silence the offensive complaints of violated justice and innocence, by adding the sanction of his office to the rapacity of power and the wantonness of oppression; there will be no intervening jury to shield the innocent, or procure redress to the injured. Fellow-citizens, although the conspirators and their abettors are not sufficiently numerous to endanger our liberties by an open and forcible attack on them, yet when the characters of which they are composed and the methods they are practising, are considered, it ought to occasion the most serious alarm, and stimulate to an immediate, vigorous and united exertion of the patriotic part of the community for the security of their rights and privileges. Societies ought to be instituted in every county and a reciprocity of sentiments and information maintained between such societies, whereby the patriots throughout Pennsylvania, being mutually enlightened and invigorated, would form an invincible bulwark to liberty, and by unity of council and exertion might the better procure and secure to themselves and to unborn ages the blessings of a good federal government. Nothing but such a system of conduct can frustrate the machinations of an ambitious junto, who, versed in Machiavelian arts, can varnish over with the semblance of freedom the most despotic instrument of government ever projected, who cannot only veil over their own ambitious purposes, but raise an outcry against the real patriots for interested views when they are advocating the cause of liberty and of [507]their country by opposing a scheme of arbitrary power and office-making; who can give the appearance of economy to the introduction of a numerous and permanent standing army and the institution of lucrative, needless offices to provide for the swarms of gaping, almost famished expectants, who have been campaigning it for ten years without success against our inestimable state constitution, as a reward for their persevering toils, but particularly for their zeal on the present occasion, and also as a phalanx to tyranny; and who notwithstanding the testimony of uniform experience evinces the necessity of restrictions on those entrusted with power, and a due dependence of the deputy on the constituent being maintained to ensure the public welfare; who notwithstanding the fate that liberty has ever met from the remissness of the people and the persevering nature of ambition who ever on the watch, grasps at every avenue to supremacy. I say, notwithstanding such evidence before them of the folly of mankind so often duped by similar arts, the conspirators have had the address to inculcate the opinion that forms of government are no security for the public liberties, that the administration is every thing,10 that although there would be no responsibility under the new constitution, no restriction on the powers of the government, whose will and pleasure would be literally the law of the land, yet that we should be perfectly safe and happy, that as our rulers would be made of the same corrupt materials as ourselves, they certainly could not abuse the trust reposed in them, but would be the most self-denying order of beings ever created; with your purses at their absolute disposal, and your liberties at their discretion, they would be proof against the charms of money and the allurements of power; however, if such Utopian ideas should prove chimerical and the people should find the yoke too heavy, they might at pleasure alleviate or even throw it off. In short, the conspirators have displayed so much ingenuity on this occasion, that if it had not been for the patriotism and firmness of some of the printers, which gave an opportunity to enlightened truth to come forward, and by her invincible powers to detect the sophistry, and expose the fallacy of such impositions, liberty must have been overcome by the wiles of ambition, and this land of freemen have become the miserable abode of slaves. (a) For the truth of this charge I appeal to the Printers. Philadelphia, January 26, 1788."

Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/5/1788,"To THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. Fellow-Citizens, I am happy to find the comment that I have made upon the nature and tendency of the new constitution, and my suspicions of the principles and designs of its authors, are fully confirmed by the evidence of the Honorable LUTHER MARTIN, Esquire, late deputy in the general convention. He has laid open the conclave, exposed the dark scene within, developed the mystery of the proceedings, and illustrated the machinations of ambition. His public spirit has drawn upon him the rage of the conspirators, for daring to remove the veil of secrecy, and announcing to the public the meditated, gilded mischief: all their powers are exerting for his destruction; the mint of calumny is assiduously engaged in coining scandal to blacken his character, and thereby to invalidate his testimony; but this illustrious patriot will rise superior to all their low arts, and be the better confirmed in the good opinion and esteem of his fellow-citizens, upon whose gratitude he has an additional claim by standing forth their champion at a crisis when most men would have shrunk from such a duty. Mr. Martin has appealed to general Washington for the truth of what he has advanced, and undaunted by the threats of his and his country�s enemies, is nobly persevering in the cause of liberty and mankind. I would earnestly recommend it to all well meaning persons to read his communication, as the most satisfactory and certain method of forming a just opinion on the present momentous question, particularly the three or four last continuances, as they go more upon the general principles and tendency of the new constitution. I have in former numbers alluded to some passages in this publication; I shall in this number quote some few others, referring to the work itself for a more lengthy detail. The following paragraphs5 are extracted from the continuances republished in the Independent Gazetteer of the 25th January, and the Pennsylvania Packet of the 1st February instant, viz. �By the eighth section of this article, Congress is to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.�When we met in convention after our adjournment, to receive the report of the committee of detail, the members of that committee were requested to inform us what powers were meant to be vested in Congress by the word duties in this section, since the word imposts extended to duties on goods imported, and by another part of the system no duties on exports were to be laid.�In answer to this inquiry we were informed, that it was meant to give the general government the power of laying stamp duties on paper, parchment and vellum. We then proposed to have the power inserted in express words, lest disputes hereafter might arise on the subject, and that the meaning might be understood by all who were to be affected by it; but to this it was objected, because it was said that the word stamp would probably sound odiously in the ears of many of the inhabitants, and be a cause of objection. By the power of imposing stamp duties the Congress will have a right to declare that no wills, deeds, or other instruments of writing, shall be good and valid, without being stamped-that without being reduced to writing and being stamped, no bargain, sale, transfer of property, or contract of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be binding; and also that no exemplifications of records, depositions, or probates of any kind shall be received in evidence, unless they have the same solemnity�They may likewise oblige all proceedings of a judicial nature to be stamped to give them effect�those stamp duties may be imposed to any amount they please, and under the pretence of securing the collection of these duties, and to prevent the laws which imposed them from being evaded, the Congress may bring the decision of all questions relating to the conveyance, disposition and rights of property and every question relating to contracts between man and man into the courts of the general government.�Their inferior courts in the first instance and the superior court by appeal. By the power to lay and collect imposts, they may impose duties on any or every article of commerce imported into these states to what amount they please. By the power to lay excises, a power very odious in its nature, since it authorises officers to go into your houses, your kitchens, your cellars, and to examine into your private concerns; the Congress may impose duties on every article of use or consumption, on the food that we eat�on the liquors we drink�on the cloaths we wear�on the glass which enlighten our houses�or the hearths necessary for our warmth and comfort. By the power to lay and collect taxes, they may proceed to direct taxation on every individual either by a capitation tax on their heads, or an assessment on their property. By this part of the section, therefore, the government has a power to lay what duties they please on goods imported�to lay what duties they please afterwards on whatever we use or consume�to impose stamp duties to what amount they please, and in whatever cases they please�afterwards to impose on the people direct taxes, by capitation tax, or by assessment, to what amount they choose, and thus to sluice them at every vein as long as they have a drop of blood, without any controul, limitation or restraint�while all the officers for collecting these taxes, stamp duties, imposts and excises, are to be appointed by the general government, under its direction, not accountable to the states; nor is there even a security that they shall be citizens of the respective states, in which they are to exercise their offices; at the same time the construction of every law imposing any and all these taxes and duties, and directing the collection of them, and every question arising thereon, and on the conduct of the officers appointed to execute these laws, and to collect these taxes and duties so various in their kinds, are taken away from the courts of justice of the different states, and confined to the courts of the general government, there to be heard and determined by judges holding their offices under the appointment, not of the states, but of the general government. �Many of the members, and myself in the number, thought that the states were much better judges of the circumstances of their citizens, and what sum of money could be collected from them by direct taxation, and of the manner in which it could be raised, with the greatest ease and convenience to their citizens, than the general government could be; and that the general government ought not in any case to have the power of laying direct taxes, but in that of the delinquency of a state. Agreeable to this sentiment, I brought in a proposition on which a vote of the convention was taken. The proposition was as follows: And wherever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue should be raised by direct taxation, having apportioned the same by the above rule, requi-sitions shall be made of the respective states to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas within a time in the said requisition to be specified, and in case of any of the states failing to comply with such requisition, then and thew only, to have power to devise and pass acts directing the mode and authorising the collection of the same. Had this proposition been acceded to, the dangerous and oppressive power in the general government of imposing direct taxes on the inhabitants, which it now enjoys in all cases, would have been only vested in it in case of the non-compliance of a state, as a punishment for its delinquency, and would have ceased that moment that the state complied with the requisition�But the proposition was rejected by a majority, consistent with their aim and desire of encreasing the power of the general government as far as possible, and destroying the powers and influence of the states�And though there is a provision that all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform, that is, to be laid to the same amount on the same articles in each state, yet this will not prevent Congress from having it in their power to cause them to fall very unequal and much heavier on some states than on others, because these duties may be laid on articles but little or not at all used in some states, and of absolute necessity for the use and consumption of others, in which case the first would pay little or no part of the revenue arising therefrom, while the whole or nearly the whole of it would be paid by the last, to wit, the states which use and consume the articles on which the imposts and excises are laid.� Another extract, viz. �But even this provision apparently for the security of the state governments, inadequate as it is, is entirely left at the mercy of the general government, for by the fourth section of the first article, it is expressly provided, that the congress shall have a power to make and alter all regu-lations concerning the time and manner of holding elections for senators; a provision expressly looking forward to, and I have no doubt designed for the utter extinction and abolition of all state governments; nor will this I believe be doubted by any person, when I inform you that some of the warm advocates and patrons of the system in convention, strenuously opposed the choice of the senators by the state legislatures, insisting that the state governments ought not to be introduced in any manner so as to be component parts of, or instruments for carrying into execution the general government�Nay, so far were the friends of the system from pretending that they meant it or considered it as a federal system, that on the question being proposed, �that a union of the states, merely federal, ought to be the sole object of the exercise of the powers vested in the convention;� it was negatived by a majority of the members, and it was resolved, `that a national government ought to be formed; afterwards the word �national� was struck out by them, because they thought the word might tend to alarm�and although now, they who advocate the system, pretend to call themselves federalists; in convention the distinction was just the reverse�those who opposed the system, were there considered and stiled the federal party, those who advocated it, the antifederal. �Viewing it as a national not a federal government, as calculated and designed not to protect and preserve, but to abolish and annihilate the state governments, it was opposed for the following reasons:�It was said that this continent was much too extensive for one national government, which should have sufficient power and energy to pervade and hold in obedience and subjection all its parts, consistent with the enjoyment and preservation of liberty�That the genius and habits of the people of Amer-ica were opposed to such a government�That during their connexion with Great-Britain they had been accustomed to have all their concerns transacted within a narrow circle, their colonial districts�They had been accustomed to have their seats of government near them, to which they might have access, without much inconvenience when their business should require it�That at this time we find if a county is rather large, the people complain of the inconvenience, and clamour for a division of their county, or for a removal of the place where their courts are held, so as to render it more central and convenient�That in those states, the territory of which is extensive, as soon as the population encreases remote from the seat of government, the inhabitants are urgent for a removal of the seat of their government, or to be erected into a new state�As a proof of this, the inhabitants of the western parts of Virginia and North Carolina, of Vermont and the province of Main, were instances, even the inhabitants of the western parts of Pennsylvania, who it was said already seriously look forward to the time when they shall either be erected into a new state, or have their seat of government removed to the Susquehanna. If the inhabitants of the different states consider it as a grievance to attend a county court or the seat of their own government, when a little inconvenient, can it be supposed they would ever submit to have a national government established, the seat of which, would be more than a thousand miles removed from some of them? It was insisted that governments of a republican nature, are those best calculated to preserve the freedom and happiness of the citizen�That governments of this kind, are only calculated for a territory but small in its extent�That the only method by which an extensive continent like America could be connected and united together consistent with the principles of freedom, must be by having a number of strong and energetic state governments for securing and protecting the rights of the individuals forming those governments, and for regulating all their concerns; and a strong energetic federal government over those states for the protection and preservation, and for regulating the common concerns of the states.�It was further insisted, that even if it was possible to effect a total abolition of the state governments at this time, and to establish one general government over the people of America, it could not long subsist, but in a little time would again be broken into a variety of governments of a smaller extent, similar in some manner to the present situation of this continent; the principal difference in all probability would be that the governments, so established, being effected by some violent convulsion, might not be formed on principles so favorable to liberty as those of our present state governments�That this ought to be an important consideration to such of the states who had excellent governments, which was the case with Maryland and most others, whatever it might be to persons who disapproving of their particular state government, would be willing to hazard every thing to overturn and destroy it.�These reasons, Sir, influenced me to vote against two branches in the legislature, and against every part of the system which was repugnant to the principles of a federal government�Nor was there a single argument urged, or reason assigned, which to my mind was satisfactory, to prove that a good government on federal principles was unattainable, the whole of their arguments only proving, what none of us controverted, that our federal government as originally formed was defective and wanted amendment�However, a majority of the convention hastily and inconsiderately, without condescending to make a fair trial, in their great wisdom, decided that a kind of government which a Montesquieu and a Price have declared the best calculated of any to preserve internal liberty, and to enjoy external strength and security, and the only one by which a large continent can be connected and united consistent with the principles of liberty was totally impracticable, and they acted accordingly.� After such information, what are we to think of the declarations of Mr. Wilson, who assured our state convention, that it was neither the intention of the authors of the new constitution, nor its tendency to establish a consolidated or national government, founded upon the destruction of the state governments, that such could not have been the design of the general convention he said was certain, because the testimony of experience, the opinions of the most celebrated writers, and the nature of the case demonstrated in the clearest manner, that so extensive a territory as these United States includes, could not be governed by any other mode than a confederacy of republics consistent with the principles of freedom, and that their own conviction was, that nothing short of the supremacy of despotism could connect and bind together this country under ONE GOVERNMENT?7 Has any one a doubt now remaining of the guilt of the conspirators! The 0-rs of the P-t 0-ce, fearful of the consequences of their conduct, are taking measures to invalidate the charge made against them. As this is a matter of the highest importance to the public, it will be necessary to state the charge and the evidence. In two of my former numbers, I asserted that the patriotic newspapers of this city and that of New-York miscarried in their passage, whilst the vehicles of despotism, meaning those newspapers in favor of the new constitution, passed as usual; and it was particularly asserted that the patriotic essays of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &c. published at New-York, were withheld during the greatest part of the time that our state convention sat; and in a late number, I further asserted that since the late arrangement at the P-t 0-ce, scarcely a newspaper was suffered to pass by the usual conveyance, and for the truth of this last charge I appealed to the printers; however I understand this last is not denied or controverted. When the dependence of the printers on the P-t 0-ce is considered, the injury they may sustain by incurring the displeasure of these of-rs, and when to this is added that of the complexion of the printers in respect to the new constitution, that most of them are zealous in promoting its advancement, it can scarcely be expected that they would volunteer it against the P-t 0-rs, or refuse their names to a certificate exculpating the of-rs; accordingly we find that most of the printers have signed a certificate that the newspapers arrived as usual prior to the first of January, when the new arrangement took place; however, the printer of the Freeman�s Journal when applied to, had the spirit to refuse his name to the establishment of a falsehood, and upon being called upon to specify the missing papers, particularly during the sitting of the state convention, he pointed out and offered to give a list of a considerable number, instancing no less than seven successive Greenleaf�s patriotic New-York papers, besides others occasionally with-held from him; Colonel Oswald was out of town when his family was applied to, or I have no doubt he would have observed a similar conduct. But there is a fact that will invalidate any certificate that can be procured on this occasion, and is alone demonstrative of the suppression of the patriotic newspapers. The opponents to the new constitution in this state were anxious to avail themselves of the well-written essays of the New-York patriots, such as Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &c. and with that view were attentive to have them republished here as soon as they came to hand, and especially during the sitting of our state convention, when they would have been the most useful to the cause of liberty by operating on the members of that convention; a recurrence to the free papers of this city at that period, well shew a great chasm in these republications, owing to the miscarriage of Greenleaf�s New-York papers; agreeable to my assertions it will appear, that for the greatest part of the time that our state convention sat, scarcely any of the numbers of Brutus, Cincinnatus, Cato, &c. were republished in this city; the fifth number of Cincinnatus that contained very material information about the finances of the union, which strikes at some of the principal arguments in favor of the new constitution, which was published at New-York the 29th November, was not republished here until the 15th December following, two or three days after the convention rose, and so of most of the other numbers of this and the other signatures; so great was the desire of the opponents here to republish them, that the fourth number of Cincinnatus was republished so lately as in Mr. Bailey�s last paper, which with other missing numbers were procured by private hands from New-York, and in two or three instances, irregular numbers were repub-lished. The new arrangement at the P-t 0-ce, novel in its nature, and peculiarly injurious by the suppression of information at this great crisis of public affairs, is a circumstance highly presumptive of the truth of the other charge."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,2/6/1788,"Thus we, by madness blinded and o�ercome, Lodge the dire monster in the sacred dome.2 My Fellow-Citizens, Before martial law is declared to be the supreme law of the land, and your character of free citizens be changed to that of the subjects of a military king, which are necessary consequences of the adoption of the proposed constitution, let me admonish you in the name of sacred liberty, to make a solemn pause. Permit a freeman to address you, and to solicit your attention to a cause wherein yourselves and your posterity are concerned. The sun never shone upon a more important one: It is the cause of freedom-of a whole continent-of yourselves and of your fellow men. Men who have so gloriously asserted the rights of human nature, and overcome tyranny, one ought reasonably to suppose could not have their spirits so much broken as peaceably to submit to it a few years afterwards. By the declaration of peace, wherein Britain acknowledged the independence and sovereignty of the United States, the people of America became citizens of the freest country under heaven. But under the proposed plan of government the least fragment of liberty cannot exist. The writers against the proposed constitution are denominated, by the aristocratics, incendiaries, and enemies to America, men whose writings tend to involve this devoted country in anarchy, and in all the horrors of a civil war. Now, in reply to this charge; let me ask the friends of this government, Is that man an incendiary who advocates the unalienable rights of the people? Is he an enemy to America who endeavors to protect the oppressed from the oppressor; who opposes a conspiracy against the liberties of his country, concerted by a few tyrants, whose views are to lord it over the rest of their fellow citizens, to trample the poorer part of the people under their feet, that they may be rendered their servants and slaves? If such a writer is an incendiary, and an enemy to America, then I glory in the character. A conspiracy against the freedom of America, both deep and dangerous, has been formed by an infernal junto of demagogues. Our thirteen free commonwealths are to be consolidated into one despotic monarchy. Is not this a position obvious? Its evidence is intuitive; and the address and dissent of the minority of the convention of Pennsylvania3 add such strength to its illustration, that no man of common sense can refuse his assent. But why need I attempt to prove a point, that that honest man and firm patriot, Mr. Martin, says the monarchy men of the federal convention declared was their intention.4 Who can deny but the president general will be a king to all intents and purposes, and one of the most dangerous kind too; a king elected to command a standing army? Thus our laws are to be administered by this tyrant; for the whole, or at least the most important part of the executive department is put in his hands. A quorum of 65 representatives, and of 26 senators, with a king at their head, are to possess powers, that extend to the lives, the liberties, and property of every citizen of America. This novel system of government, were it possible to establish it, would be a compound of monarchy and aristocracy, the most accursed that ever the world witnessed. About 50 (these being a quorum) of the well born, and a military king, with a standing army devoted to his will, are to have an uncontrouled power over our lives, our liberties, and property, in all cases whatsoever. Is he an incendiary who abhors the thought of such a government, who declares it his opinion, that none but a sycophant or a slave could submit to it? I think not; and there is no power under heaven that could cause me to change my opinion; which has the joint evidences of reason and experience for its foundation. There is not a tincture of democracy in the proposed constitution, except the nominal elections of the president general and the illustrious Congress be supposed to have some colour of that nature; but this is a mere deception, invented to gull the people into its adoption. Its framers were well aware that some appearance of election ought to be observed, especially in regard to the first Congress; for without such an appearance there was not the smallest probability of their having it organized and set in operation. But let the wheels of this government be once cleverly set in motion, and I�ll answer for it, that the people shall not be much troubled with future elections, especially in choosing their king, the standing army will do that business for them. The thoughts of a military officer possessing such powers, as the proposed constitution vests in the president general, are sufficient to excite in the mind of a freeman the most alarming apprehensions; and ought to rouse him to oppose it at all events. Every freeman of America ought to hold up this idea to himself, that he has no superior but God and the laws. But this tyrant will be so much his superior, that he can at any time he thinks proper, order him out in the militia to exercise, and to march when and where he pleases. His officers can wantonly inflict the most disgraceful punishment on a peaceable citizen, under pretence of disobedience, or the smallest neglect of militia duty. Among the substantial objections to the great powers of the president, that of his negative upon the laws, is one of the most inconsiderable, indeed it is more a sound than any thing else; For, if he be a bold enterprising fellow, there is little fear of his ever having to exercise it. The two branches of the legislature, will be at his service; no law contrary to his sentiments, however salutary in its operation, dare be mentioned by them. As a body, [59]and as individuals, they will be his sycophants and flatterers. But, if on the contrary he should not be a man of spirit, a thing very improbable, as none but an ambitious man, well versed in the ways of men, could have the address to be raised to that elevated station; if, however, I say, he should not be a man of an enterprising spirit, in that case he will be a minion of the aristocratics, doing according to their will and pleasure, and confirming every law they may think proper to make, without any regard to their public utility. Every idea of such unlimited powers being lodged in so small a number of the well born, elevated so far above the rest of their fellow citizens, and supported by a king with a standing army at his disposal, ought to cause the blood of a free citizen to boil with indignation: the very mentioning of it shocks my whole frame. I abhor the thought from my soul: And I flatter myself that the people of this continent will not suffer such a government to be placed over them. Indeed it astonishes me, that the conspirators who framed it, had not the most dreadful apprehensions of their personal safety, from the just resentment of the freemen of an insulted country. To such lengths have these bold conspirators carried their scheme of despotism, that your most sacred rights and privileges are surrendered at discretion. When government thinks proper, under the pretence of writing a libel, &c. it may imprison, inflict the most cruel and unusual punishment, seize property, carry on prosecutions, &c. and the unfortunate citizen has no magna charta, no bill of rights, to protect him; nay, the prosecution may be carried on in such a manner that even a jury will not be allowed him. Where is that base slave who would not appeal to the ultima ratio, before he submits to this government? If the despots persist in pushing it on, let them answer the consequences; they may fall a sacrifice to their own obstinacy; for liberty will triumph over every obstacle, even were a standing army opposed to it. To preserve the peace of the country, every patriot should exert himself at this awful crisis, and use his influence to have another federal convention called as soon as possible; either to amend the old articles of confederation, or to frame a constitution on revolution principles, that may secure the freedom of America to the remotest time.5 If the State of Massachusetts should reject the proposed constitution, of which there is a strong probability, what a contemptible figure must its advocates make, who, after it made its appearance from the dark conclave, affirmed that there was but five men opposed to it in the United States.6 The convention of that state was chosen in the moment of blind enthusiasm, and yet we find it so much divided that the issue is doubtful. The sentiments of the people are changing every day, and were that convention to be elected now, I doubt not but four fifths would be against it. In the back counties of Pennsylvania, where the well born have no influence, the opposition is said to have become so powerful that a person would be in danger of losing his life, if he ventured to speak a word in its favor. The conspirators saw clearly, that such a system of government could never be established over freemen, except they were taken by surprize; and hence they hurried matters forward with that view; in short, the people were made to believe, that they were all dead men, if they did not adopt it immediately. Even still they are endeavoring to hold up the idea of anarchy being the consequence of rejection: But he must have very weak intellects indeed, and little acquainted with the spirit of freemen, to whom it is not obvious that adoption will produce anarchy and ruin. No evil can result from calling another general convention, but much good would be the consequence. The distresses of America are not of that nature to be healed all of a sudden; some of them indeed have arisen from the defects in the general government; but there are others of a different kind, that must be removed by time, and by the prudence of the people at large. Ye patriots! ye lovers of peace, of liberty, and of your fellow men! Ye are called upon at this solemn juncture, to stand forth and save your country; before the breach is too wide, and while the parties may still be reconciled to each other; before anarchy stalks through the land; and before the sword of civil discord is unsheathed. For the sake of every thing that is great and good, and as you shall answer for it at the great tribunal, use your influence to procure another general convention with all possible speed, as the only way left to preserve the union of America, and to save your fellow citizens from misery and destruction."
Newspaper,No,An Old Whig,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/6/1788,"Mr. PRINTER, It is the fate of political controversies to begin with argument and end with abuse: And hence we find, in many instances, that a subject which for a time, has engaged the most earnest attention of the people, is at length quitted with horror and disgust. The question, however, concerning the total adoption of the plan of government, proposed by the late federal convention, is too important for good men to suffer themselves to be diverted from giving it a full consideration by the bouncing of squibs or the whizzing of political firebrands. I therefore persuade myself that a few candid observations on this subject will yet be heard with attention. The real question is this;�Whether the people of this country ought to adopt the proposed constitution in its present form, without limitation or alteration, or whether we ought to insist upon amendments being made previous to its adoption. Most men seem to agree that amendments ought to be made in the proposed plan in some stage of the business; and all seem agreed that an [53]efficient form of continental government ought to be established. Shall we then first adopt the constitution and afterwards amend it; or shall we first amend it and afterwards adopt it? Let us for a moment consider the propriety of adopting it first, and trusting to its being afterwards amended. These necessary amendments, after the constitution is adopted, can only be made in one or two ways;�either by our future rulers in the continental legislature by their own act-or in the way provided for in the fifth article, by a convention to be called for proposing amendments, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, or whenever the legislatures of two-thirds of the states shall make application for that purpose, such amendments afterwards to be valid if ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, if Congress should think proper to call them. This latter mode is so intricate, that an attempt to investigate it is like endeavouring to trace the windings of a labyrinth, and I have therefore observed that people willingly turn aside from the subject, as confused and disgusting. Some former observations on this article I found were very little attended to: However I will attempt once more to find a clue to its mazes, after I shall first have considered that more inviting ground of expectation to which most of those who assume the name of federalists turn their eyes with so much confidence. First then, the general expectation seems to be that our future rulers will rectify all that is amiss. If a bill of rights is wanting, they will frame a bill of rights. If too much power is vested in them, they will not abuse it; nay, they will divest themselves of it. The very first thing they will do, will be to establish the liberties of the people by good and wholesome ordinances, on so solid a foundation as to baffle all future encroachments from themselves or their sucessors. Much good no doubt might be done in this way; if Congress should possess the most virtuous inclinations, yet there are some things which it will not be in their power to rectify. For instance; the appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, which is given to the supreme court of the continent, and which annihilates the trial by jury in all civil causes, the Congress can only modify:�They cannot extinguish this power, so destructive to the principles of real liberty. It would not by any means be extravagant to say, that a new continental convention ought to be called, if it were only for the sake of preserving that sacred palladium�the inestimable right of trial by jury.�But even if we were to delude ourselves so far as to believe that it would be entirely in the power of the future legislature to set every thing right, to build up our liberties against all invasions, and to protect us from every political calamity, still we ought not to repose all our liberty and all our happiness in the virtue of our future rulers. I speak not with reference to any particular set of men. I pretend not to know who will be our rulers one year hence. In the state of Pennsylvania I have seen the administration of our constitution in the hands of its bitterest enemies, during near one half of its existence; and I [54]shall not be at all surprized to find that if the new continental government shall be set a-going, that the jockies who at present have vaulted into the saddle; should be the first to be thrown into the dirt and trampled upon; nor, on the other hand, that some of those who are foremost in contending for a permanent security to the rights of the people, should be in the first rank of oppressors. These things have frequently happened; and the only safe way of reasoning on political subjects is, to consider men, abstractly as men, with like passions and infirmities throughout the world, in every age, and every country; and to believe that the same guards and checks against arbitrary power, which were necessary two thousand years ago, are equally necessary at present, and will be so two thousand years hence. Idolatry is the parent of errors in politics as well as religion;�and an implicit confidence in our rulers now, will be abused as much as implicit confidence in priests ever was in the days of superstition. I know well that instances of political moderation may be found, and a tyrant has before now descended from the plenitude of power, satiated with dominion, or worn out with care; but there is not one instance on record in all history of a number of men voluntarily abandoning the powers of an aristocracy. Look at the Decemviri, look at the thirty tyrants of Athens, look at all the lordly aristocracies that ever existed, and shew me one instance-such an instance cannot be shewn. Nay farther, a single monarch has many times used his power with moderation; but a number of men combined in an aristocracy, never knew what moderation meant. They are all struggling to be most powerful, all aiming to enrich themselves and provide for their friends, and all of them plundering the people. And shall we foolishly, after so many thousand examples, trust to the virtue and moderation of our future rulers, to divest themselves of those powers which may be abused to our prejudice, and are no way useful to our protection? Not to insist upon Swift�s ludicrous tale of Jack�s hanging himself at the instigation of Humphry Hocus, on the promise of being cut down before he should be dead, and when he had hanged himself, of being left to kick his heels in the air, the moral of which, by the bye, is strictly founded in human nature;2�let us attend to a more serious fable.��A man, says �sop, coming into a wood, begged the trees to grant him the favor of a handle to his axe. The whole forest consented; upon which he provided himself with a strong handle; which he had no sooner done, than he began to fell the trees without number, then the trees, though too late, repented of their weakness, and an universal groan was heard throughout the forest. At length, when the man came to cut down the tree which had furnished him with the handle, the trunk fell to the ground uttering these words: Fool that I was! I have been the cause of my own destruction.�3 If we perish in America, we shall have no better comfort than the same mortifying reflection, that we have been the cause of our own destruction. I have said that many of the liberties which, by the proposed constitution, are to be surrendered up into the hands of our rulers, will be of no [55]use towards the protection of the people; and a little reflection will convince us, that it is certainly the case. If, indeed, government were really strengthened by such surrender, if the body of the people were made more secure, or more happy by the means, we ought to make the sacrifice. An individual ought to submit to be tossed about, imprisoned and treated injuriously, if the good of his country should require it; and every individual in the community ought to strip himself of some convenience for the sake of the public good. I know it is an error not uncommon to believe, that a government is the more powerful in proportion as it is more tyrannical; but this is not the case: so far from it, that it has always been found, that free countries have been able to exert powers far superior to those in which a more absolute government prevailed. For instance, a senate which is master of its own elections, without any or with very little dependence on the people, would not be able to exert as much force as a senate which is freely elected by the people; because the chearful support which would be yielded in the latter case, would far exceed that which could be exacted by the mere force of authority. Again; how could the stripping people of the right of trial by jury conduce to the strength of the state? Do we find the government in England at all weakened by the people retaining the right of trial by jury? Far from it. Yet these things which merely tend to oppress the people, without conducing at all to the strength of the state, are the last which aristocratic rulers would consent to restore to the people; because they encrease the personal power and importance of the rulers. Judges, unincumbered by juries, have been ever found much better friends to government than to the people. Such judges will always be more desireable than juries to a self-created senate, upon the same principle that a large standing army, and the entire command of the militia and of the purse, is ever desireable to those who wish to enslave the people, and upon the same principle that a bill of rights is their aversion. In like manner, if we should trace the several branches of the proposed constitution, which are obnoxious to the liberties of the people, we shall find them to consist of such articles as are rather fitted to encrease the powers of the rulers, than the strength of the nation. Union is the great source of strength to a nation, not vassalage. To an aristocractic government vassalage is the great object even at the expence of union among the people. We ought not, therefore, by any means to rely upon the virtue of our future rulers for a reformation of those things which at present are amiss in the proposed constitution. The president and senate will ever be grasping at more and more power until they are completely masters of the people, and the president at last master of all. Let us then turn to the article in the proposed constitution, which provides for the making alterations at some future period; and let us figure to ourselves the time when two-thirds of both houses of Congress shall think [56]it necessary to call a convention, or two-thirds of the legislatures of the individual states shall apply for the calling of a convention, and when a continental convention shall agree upon amendments, and when the legislatures of three-fourths of the states, or three-fourths of the conventions to be called in the several states, if Congress shall prefer that mode of proceeding, shall ratify such amendments; and again, after all these strainings, and filtrings, and refinings, of the hopes and expectations of the people through the channels of power, when the amendments so asked for, proposed, digested, twistificated, altered, and at last ratified, will be of any essential importance. For my part I would full as soon sit down and take my chance of winning an important privilege to the people, by the casting the dice �till I could throw sixes an hundred times in succession.�There is no doubt but the thing has been purposely contrived to make alterations extremely difficult; and so it certainly ought to be if the proposed constitution were a good one. I do not therefore so much blame the late federal convention for making their constitution very difficult of alteration, as I insist upon it as an argument in favor of making our amendments beforehand. A machine which cannot be taken to pieces after it is once set a-going, ought to be very well finished at first. Yet this is not all the difficulty. Inveterate power is at all times very hard to be controuled. Habits, connexions, dependence, and a thousand circumstances in course of time, rivet the chains of slavery �till we grow either callous to their galling, or too feeble to shake them off, or too listless to resist. Ask the beaten Turk to resume his liberty, or the tired horse to resume his pristine freedom.�As well might you ask the galled sons of America, a few years hence, to assert the native rights of men, if the proposed constitution be once fixed upon us. It will be extremely difficult to change it for the better even in the beginning; but in a little time it will become utterly impossible. A little prudence, a little patience, and a little serious reflection, would lead us to concur in calling a new convention, to revise the constitution proposed to us. That convention, I have no doubt, if fully, freely, and deliberately chosen, would concur in some essential amendments; and we might yet be a united and a happy people."

Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,2/16/1788,"An address of Thanks from a number of the Inhabitants of the borough of Carlisle, to the minority of the late State Convention, in general, and the representatives of Cumberland County, in particular. Gentlemen: WE return you our hearty thanks for the magnanimous and spirited opposition which you made in the late state Convention, to that instrument of oppression, injustice, and tyranny, which was then the subject of your deliberations, viz., the proposed Constitution for the United States. We assure you, that your conduct meets with our most cordial approbation, and fully answers the expectation we formed of you when we voted you to represent us. Altho we did not tie up your hands, by dictating to you how to behave or what side to take, nor did we preclude you from investigating its properties or discussing its principles in the most ample manner, according to the dictates of your own enlightened understanding, by extorting from you, previous to your election, or afterwards, any promises or engagements to vote for or [662page icon]against the proposed plan; this would have been treating you like machines or tools, and for such a purpose as this parrots and magpies trained to prattle would have answered the purpose much better than freemen. Nevertheless, gentlemen, the measures you have taken have fully justified the confidence we reposed in you, and comes up to our most sanguine wishes. We, gentlemen, with you, deprecate the impending ruin, and deplore the unhappy fate of our dear country and innocent posterity, should this engine of slavery ever be established. We sincerely grieve to see the people of this state plunge themselves into the jaws of destruction, and sacrifice their dearest interests to gratify the ambition of a few selfish despots. Yet we sorrow not as those who have no hope. We are happy to find that a formidable opposition is made to it in some of our sister states. We rejoice in the expectation of your cogent arguments and spirited protest being disseminated through America, and rousing multitudes from their supine lethargy, and opening the eyes of others who are blinded with prejudice, and misled by artful men; we comfort ourselves with the hope that your example will animate such citizens of our own state, whose generous souls recoil at the idea of slavery, and who have not yet degenerated so far from their original principles as to be content to live in fetters, to oppose it. We hope it is not yet too late, although the chains are making they are not yet riveted on, and their Constitution is not yet �the supreme law of the land,� and we flatter ourselves it never will. When liberty was the grand question, America combated an infinitely more formidable power than the partisans of the proposed Constitution; when her rights and privileges were invaded by one of the most puissant monarchs on earth, she bravely resisted the attack, and laughed at the shaking of their spear�she despised their menaces, and returned their threats with redoubled vengeance on their own heads. Will her brave freeborn yeomen, then, tamely submit to be circumvented or cajoled out of their freedom and invaluable rights by a few petty domestic tyrants? No, we are persuaded they never will. It is, gentlemen, with the most agreeable surprise that we behold a very few country farmers and mechanics nonplus the great rabbis and doctors of the schools, who no doubt summoned in all the rhetoric, logic, and sophistry they were capable of on this occasion. We rejoice to see scholastic learning and erudition fly before simple reason, plain truth, and common sense. But though you defeated them in argument, they exceeded you in numbers; however, should the worst happen (which Heaven avert) this will be your consolation, that in the time of danger you exerted every effort to prevent the calamity; [663page icon]you exonerated your consciences by a faithful discharge of your duty. Your names will descend to posterity with admiration and esteem, when those of your opponents will be loaded with infamy and execration. It will be said, These were the Demosthenes�s, the Bruti, the Cato�s of America, when your antagonists will be classed with the vilest tyrants that ever disgraced human nature. This will be a sufficient compensation for all the outrage and insult you have received from the senseless, ignorant rabble in Philadelphia, and the harsh rude treatment given you by such of the aristocratical junto as were members of the Convention; so that your reward is sure, suppose this Constitution should even be adopted universally, which we are persuaded will never be. The late glorious Revolution is too recent in the memory of American freemen, to suffer this. It may occasion a small conflict, but the cause of liberty is worth contending for, and we firmly believe there are yet numbers who will account it their highest honor to unite with you in the glorious struggle. That the same spirit which actuated you from the first appearance of this baneful instrument may predominate in the breast of every brave American is, gentlemen, the most ardent desire of your inflexible adherents. Signed by order of the meeting, William Brown, in the chair. George Logue, Clerk.2"
Newspaper,No,Hampden,,Pittsburgh Gazette,,2/16/1788,"The Constitution proposed for the government of the United States is of such importance to the present age, as fully to justify an honest and free discussion thereof. Yet the magnitude of the subject certainly requires that such as offer their sentiments respecting it to the public should themselves have a competent knowledge of its principles. It may be freely granted, that from a mistaken zeal in favor of that political liberty which was so recently purchased at so costly a rate, even good men may give it unreasonable opposition, but such men cannot reasonably be charged with sordid personal interest as their motive; because it is great and sudden changes which produces opportunities of preferment; but that class of men, who either [664page icon]prompted by their own ambition or desperate fortunes, are expecting employments under the proposed plan, or those weak and ardent men who always expect to be gainers by revolutions, and who are never contented, but always hastening from one difficulty to another; may be expected to ascribe every excellence to the proposed system and to urge a thousand reasons for our real or supposed distresses, to induce our adopting thereof. Such characters may also be expected to promise us such extravagantly flattering advantages to arise from it, as if it was accompanied with such miraculous divine energy as divided the Red Sea and spake with thunder on Mount Sinai.2 Sober-minded citizens, however, will not be intimidated with bugbears, nor will they expect magical wonders. They know well that it is only our industry and frugality that can pay our debts and make us respectable; that the utmost which the best regulated governments can do is only to protect and encourage our industry, and in some moderate degree, to correct luxury. All the friends to our country have wished that the powers of regulating commerce and levying imposts should be vested in the general government. Pennsylvania and most of the other states agreed by law to surrender these powers several years since, when Congress required it; the opposition of one state rendered a federal convention necessary. All in this state who oppose the proposed system are willing to invest the general government with all the power that ever Congress asked for or declared to be necessary. Many sensible patriots, from their earnest desire of giving sufficient federal powers, and their honest unsuspecting confidence in the Federal Convention, were well pleased with the proposed system at the first examination thereof, who have since entirely changed their opinion of it, having by a more strict scrutiny penetrated the mystery with which much of it is enwrapped, and understood the extent of the powers to be given up, as well as the highly dangerous combination of the legislative and executive departments. I make no doubt but this is the case with such of the inhabitants of the town of Pittsburgh, who, on the 9th of November last, published sentiments highly favorable to the proposed system.3 As that is the only publication which hath, to my knowledge, originated in this western country upon the subject, I hope my taking some notice of a few expressions therein contained will not give offense to so respectable a town meeting. The expressions to which I confine my remarks, run thus��We are of opinion that it is the result of much political wisdom, good sense, and candor in those who framed it.� I shall address my attention chiefly to the character of candor, as it relates either to the Convention itself or to the system which they have proposed. Things are come to that crisis which justify a free examination and it [665page icon]is happy that to examine freely is not yet declared to be treason, or that the liberty of the press is not already restrained. Was it the result of candor? Let us first examine facts. The State of Virginia set the example and eleven other states followed the example in appointing delegates to hold a federal convention, and Congress recommended the measure. The delegates were strictly limited by the law of their appointment solely to the revising the existing Confederation and reporting the result to Congress.4 In the meantime the people at large had great hopes and few jealousies, because the Convention had powers to brace, but not to destroy the Confederation; they had authority to recommend more extensive federal powers to the general government, but not dissolve the constitutions of the several states, and give ultimately the whole internal sovereign power to Congress, was as far from being included in their appointment, as it was from the expectation and wishes of the people. If they had strengthened the Confederation, and increased the federal powers; if they had clothed Congress with every general power belonging to the United States, would they not have done their duty? Would they not have fulfilled their trust according to the law of their appointment? Would they then not have merited the character of candor? But if it doth not appear that they have discharged any part of the sacred trust reposed in them, but that they, on the contrary, as far as in them lay, destroyed the very object of their appointment; whatever may be said of them otherwise, I hope the character of candor will be given up. But to be more particular; that honorable body, after entering into a bond of secrecy which, however plausible and artful the reasons might be which brought that measure about, was certainly not necessary at least after their business was brought into form; because the secret transactions of government, such as making treaties, conducting war, and the like, was not the object of their deliberations. When four months was spent in mysterious secrecy, a system of a very novel and unexpected nature was transmitted to Congress, who though vehemently urged (by a number of such as were members both of the Convention and of Congress) to signify their approbation of the system, entirely refused to do it, and [��] [��] transmit it to the states without any [recomm]endation. With respect to such members of the Federal Convention, who were also members of the Pennsylvania Assembly, they, upon the designed last day of the sitting of that House, moved and urged the calling a convention for adopting the Constitution before the people could be acquainted with it, and they finally compelled a vote of the House by the aid of a mob, and imposed upon the people a declaration that it had been transmitted to them by Congress, whereas the truth is, it was not so transmitted until a number of days after the House had gone through the business and rose. It ought to be noticed that, as members of the Assembly, those very men were solemnly sworn to preserve the [state] constitution inviolate, though, under the bond of that sacred oath, they were using the utmost violence to destroy it. I ask the advocates of this conduct (if there are any) if this merits the character of candor? If it doth, the term must certainly have changed its meaning. But call it what you will, the impartial page of future history will doubtless record the whole transaction taken together as an uncommon instance of insidious usurpation, fraught with a solemn lesson to future ages and rising nations. But I shall proceed to examine how far candor is the genuine characteristic of the system, which was the result of such conduct. The first clause of the Constitution assures us that the legislative powers shall be vested in a Congress, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives; and in the second clause of the second Article, it is declared that the President, by and with the consent of the Senate, is to make treaties. Here the supreme executive magistrate is officially connected with the highest branch of the legislature; and in Article sixth, clause second, we find that all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. When we consider the extent of treaties; that in fixing the tariff of trade, the imposts and port duties generally are or may be fixed; and by a large construction, which interested rulers are never at a loss to give to any constitutional power. Treaties may be extended to almost every legislative object of the general government. Who is it that doth not know that by treaties in Europe the succession and constitution of many sovereign states hath been regulated. The Partition Treaty, and the War of the Grand Alliance, respecting the government of Spain, are well remembered; nor is it long since three neighboring powers established a nobleman of that nation upon the throne and regulated and altered the fundamental laws of that country, as well as divided the territory thereof, and all this was done by treaty. And from this power of making treaties, the House of Representatives, which hath the best chance of possessing virtue and public confidence is entirely excluded. Indeed, I see nothing to hinder the President and Senate, at a convenient crisis, to declare themselves hereditary and supreme, and the lower house altogether useless, and to abolish what shadow of the state constitutions remain by this power alone; and as the President and Senate have all that influence which arises from the creating and appointing of all offices and officers, who can doubt but at a proper occasion they will succeed in such an attempt? and who can doubt but that men will arise who will attempt it? Will the doing so be a more flagrant breach of trust, or a greater degree of violence and perfidy, than hath already been practiced, in order to introduce the proposed plan? Do these inconsistent arrangements and contradictory declarations of power merit the character of candor? Of the same kind, and full as inconsistent and dangerous, is the first clause of the second Article compared with the second clause of the second section, we first find the President fully and absolutely vested with the executive power, and presently we find the most important and most influential portion of the executive power, viz., the appointment of all officers vested in the Senate; with whom the President only acts as a nominating member. It is on this account that I have said above that the greatest degree of virtue may be expected in the House of Representatives, for if any considerable part of the executive power be joined with the legislature, it will as surely corrupt that branch with which it is combined, as poison will the human body; therefore, though the small House of Representatives will consist of the natural aristocracy of the country, as well as the Senate, yet not being dangerously combined with the executive branch, it hath not such certain influential inducements to corruption. Doth this contradiction justify the character of candor? To the character of being inconsistent, I shall add that of being mysterious and hard to be understood, or at least very liable of being misunderstood. What reader will say that the other persons, three-fifths of which are to be taken with a view to taxation and representation, or the clause respecting the raising of a revenue from, or prohibiting the importation of persons in the first and ninth sections, is expressed with candid clearness? If slaves, or emigrant servants only are designed, why are they not so expressed? Candor certainly required a manner of expression suitable to the people�s uptakings. I find that most readers believe that the House of Representatives are certainly to consist of one to 30,000 whereas the truth is they are to consist of one to 50,000 and may be reduced to one to [?]00,000 if our future rulers see fit. The number of 30,000 was inserted out of compliment to General Washington, near the close of their sitting, who, being confined to his chair, had no vote nor share in the arguments, but was so much displeased with the smallness of the representation that he requested an alteration. They complimented him with a nominal change in the ratio, but not with an increased representation.5 But passing other instances which repeated and attentive reading will discover, I would ask what is meant by the guarantee of a [668page icon]republican form of government to each of the states? Why not guarantee to them their own forms of government or free forms of government? It is but too well-known that under aristocratical republics, there is often less personal freedom and political importance enjoyed by the people at large than under despotic forms, witness, Poland, Venice, and other aristocracies. In the official letter from the Convention to Congress, they say that the proposed plan is the result of that mutual deference and concession, which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.6 It is well-known that all the states have by their own constitution reserved unalienably unto their citizens, the right of trial by jury, in civil as well as in criminal cases; and the liberty of the press, as well as restrictions against standing armies in times of peace, etc. Surely then, these rights to the arbitrary will of our future rulers could not arise from the political situation of the different states. Candor would have dictated a more honest reason. No doubt remains with me, but an aristocracy was the design, at least of those who prevailed so far as to vitiate a plan, the outlines of which I believe were at first well arranged and is yet capable of being made a good government, and I trust in the virtue of the United States that the dark and dangerous paths thereof will be properly altered and then adopted. But it will be asked, no doubt, who is this that dares so boldly to arraign the conduct and censure the production of a Convention composed of so chosen a band of patriots? To this I answer, that I am a freeman, and it is the character of freemen to examine and judge for themselves; they know that implicit faith respecting politics is the handmaid to slavery, and that the greatness of those names who frame a government cannot sanctify its faults, nor prevent the evils that result from its imperfections. Delicacy forbids that scrutiny into particular characters, which the boasting advocates of the new system seem to invite; and indeed the adding so much weight on the gilding of great names betrays a want of more substantial aid. However, I cheerfully grant that the names of Franklin and Washington would do honor to any deliberative body; their patriotism is unquestionable; but had those great men been the framers of the system, we ought not for this to give up our right of judging, but the case is quite otherwise. We know that General Washington, being President, was obliged to sign officially, whatsoever the majority resolved upon, let it be ever so contrary to his own sentiments; and though the general proceedings of that body are still a secret, we yet certainly know that he expressed a considerable degree of disapprobation of the system, by breaking through the established rules, in order to have it amended, in the important instance before mentioned. With respect to Dr. Frankin, it is now also [669page icon]well-known that he was all along in the minority; that after long labor the patriots of the minority procured some alterations to the better; that Doctor Franklin never approved of it in the Federal Convention, but even to the last expressed his apprehension that it would end in despotism, though he and several others joined it out of submission to the majority, and as the best they could obtain to lay before the people. Messrs. [George] Mason, [Elbridge] Gerry, and [Edmund] Randolph, who refused absolutely to sign the system, were also patriots who souls had been tried, and many such characters retired hopeless before the question was taken. With respect to the majority, I do not doubt the testimony of a dignified supporter of the system that they were all, or nearly all, eminent lawyers; but I do doubt the patriotism and political virtue of several of the most eminently active of them, but it is not with the men, but with the plan to which they gave birth, we have to contend, and to contend with such a degree of moderation and firmness as will best promote political security shall be the endeavor of HAMPDEN."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,2/20/1788,"My Fellow-Citizens, If stupid irony, falsehood, scurrility, and abusive language, be sufficient to silence a writer in the cause of freedom, my sentiments must have been suppressed long ago; but that old saying, that nothing cuts like the truth, has encouraged me to address you once more. Probably this essay may be more obnoxious to the friends of the proposed plan of government than any of my former publications; and if so, the above saying is farther confirmed. A freeman must have a little soul indeed, whose attention can be diverted from its proper object, by the schemes practised by the friends of unlimited dominion. His own happiness, as being connected with the happiness of his fellow-men, ought to be his chiefest good. The divine founder of our religion and his beatified followers had no aim but this, and they pursued it with a zeal consistent with its excellence. If the proposed plan be a good one upon the whole, why should its friends endeavour to prevent investigating its merits or defects? Why should they hurry it on us before we have even read it? Does not this look suspicious like? Is it not a proof that it is the works of darkness, and cannot bear the light? Why should they summon a Convention in Pennsylvania, before the tenth part of the people had time to judge for themselves, or to know whether it was a free or a tyrannical system of government? Why [159]employ bullies to drag some members of the Assembly per force to the House to make a quorum, in order to call a Convention?2 The answers of these interrogatives are obvious, and the conclusions deduced from them will in time have their proper effect. The principles of its framers are now clearly understood; the proceedings of the dark conclave have undergone an ordeal in Maryland, that exhibits the monarchy-men in convention as a set of the basest conspirators that ever disgraced a free country.3 At the time that these men were plotting the ruin of their country, and forming a system of national cruelty unequalled in the annals of time, the unsuspecting freemen of America were blessing them, were praying for them in their private families, and in their public churches, and looking up to them for relief; they even called the federal convention an august body, the most excellent assembly of men that ever appeared in the world. The President-general, who is to be our king after this government is established, is vested with powers exceeding those of the most despotic monarch we know of in modern times. What a handsome return have these men made to the people of America for their confidence! Through the misconduct of these bold conspirators we have lost the most glorious opportunity that any country ever had to establish a free system of government. America under one purely democratical, would be rendered the happiest and most powerful nation in the universe; but under the proposed one, composed of an elective king and a standing army, officered by his sycophants, the starvelings of the Cincinnati, and an aristocratical Congress of the well-born, an iota of happiness, freedom or national strength cannot exist. What a pitiful figure will these ungrateful men make in history; who, for the hopes of obtaining some lucrative employment, or of receiving a little more homage from the rest of their fellow creatures, framed a system of oppression that must involve in its consequences the misery of their own offspring? There is but one rational way remaining to prevent themselves from being eye witnesses of a dreadful scene, and that is for them to cease immediately every operation that respects the establishing of this plan of government; and then all parties will join heartily in calling another federal convention, and the peace of the country will be preserved. One of the members of the virtuous minority of the convention of Massachusetts openly declared in that assembly, that pushing on this accursed system would produce a civil war:4 the freemen of New-England, the best soldiers on the continent, have had their eyes opened, and begin to see through the conspiracy; that sacred palladium of liberty, the freedom of the press, has dispelled the cloud, and cleared their understandings. In that state, through the influence of the tyrants of Boston, very little information has reached the people;5 the press, generally speaking, was devoted to the well-born and their tools; yet out of near 400 members, of which that convention consisted, only a majority of 19 could be procured, notwithstanding [160]every possible method of overawing, threatening and bribing was practised.6 I conceive that carrying it by so small a majority, is little better than a rejection; in fact it may prove worse, for the breach is only widened so much the more by it, and truly it was wide enough before. The freemen of Massachusetts will never cowardly surrender their sacred rights and liberties into the hands of one man, or any body of men whatever. They know what freedom is, and they will support it at the risque of their lives and fortunes. Their courage, fortitude, and atchievments in the late war have rendered their character, as friends to liberty, immortal. The amendments proposed by the president will be another source of mischief; the people cannot be so ignorant as to be deceived by so pitiful a man�uvre. Here is a positive acknowledgement made by one of its advocates, who hopes to be appointed the little king if not the big one, that it is objectionable; and his amendments are introduced as a blind; the weighty ones are untouched: not a whimper of the extraordinary powers of the President-general, the standing army, the liberty of the press, &c.7 No, no! if these glorious parts be lopped off, what would become of the monarchy-men? And respecting internal taxation,8 is not his amendment a disgrace to himself, and an insult to the understanding of the people? Mr. Hancock knows, or ought to know at least, that the liberties of the citizens of America are not to be trifled with: his schemes are too flimsey not to be seen through. The allegiance of freemen to government will ever be a consequence of protection; the Congress of America withdrew their allegiance from the king of Great-Britain when he changed his protection into acts of cruelty; and on the same account the citizens of these United States will not chearfully bear allegiance to the new government; which, instead of protecting them in their sacred rights and privileges, will be a system of tyranny and oppression. The unlimited powers of the new Congress in respect to taxation, are abundantly sufficient to alarm the people. While the state assemblies retained the right of internal taxation, the country farmers could not be burdened beyond their abilities; these men being the true representatives of the people, would never attempt to levy an oppressive tax; their own feelings and interests being congenial with those of their constituents, their consent must be withheld when a measure was proposed subversive of public good. That the new Congress will not be the immediate representatives of the people, that their number is too small, their powers too great, their accountability to the people not properly secured, and above all the executive dangerously placed in the hands of one man, who is really a king, have been fully illustrated by many able writers, and ably proved in the conventions of this state and Massachusetts by worthy patriots whose names will be revered as long as time shall remain. Upon the whole, my fellow citizens, if the great characters, who are said to advocate this system of government, [161]wish to act consistently, the greatest proof they can give of their love for their country, is to join the rest of their fellow citizens in endeavouring to call another federal convention."
Newspaper,No,Deliberator,,Freeman's Journal,A Freeman,2/20/1788,"Mr. Bailey. A writer in the Pennsylvania Packet, under the signature of A Freeman, I has lately entered the lists as another champion for the proposed constitution; particularly he has endeavoured to shew that our apprehensions of this plan of government being a consolidation of the United States into one government, and not a confederacy of sovereign independent states, is entirely groundless; and it must be acknowledged, that he has advocated this cause with as much shew of reason, perhaps, as the subject will admit. The words states, several states, and united states are, he observes, frequently mentioned in the constitution-and this is an argument that their separate sovereignty and independence cannot be in danger! He has enumerated a variety of matters which, he says, Congress cannot do, and which the states, in their individual capacity, must or may do, and thence infers their sovereignty and independence. In some of these, however, I apprehend he is a little mistaken. (1.) Congress cannot train the militia. -This is not strictly true; for by the 1st Article they are empowered to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining them; and tho' the respective states are said to have the authority of training the militia, it must be according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. In this business, therefore, they will be no other than subalterns under Congress, to execute their orders; which, if they shall neglect to do, Congress will have constitutional powers to provide for, by any other means they shall think proper. They shall have power to declare what description of persons shall compose the militia; to appoint the stated times and places for exercising them; to compel personal attendance, whether when called forth into actual service, or on other occasions, under what penalties they shall think proper, without regard to scruples of conscience, or any other consideration; their executive officer may march, and countermarch them from one extremity of the state to the other-and all this without so much as consulting the legislature of the particular states to which they belong! Where then is that boasted security against the annihilation of the state governments, arising from the powerful military support they will have from their militia? (2.) Congress cannot enact laws for the inspection of the produce of the country. -Neither is this strictly true. The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying this power (among others vested in them by the constitution) into execution, most certainly extends to the enacting of inspection laws. The particular states may indeed propose such laws to them; but it is expressly declared, in the 1st article, that all such laws shall be subject to the revision and controul of the Congress. (3.) The several states can ... prohibit or impose duties on the importation of slaves into their own ports-Nay, not even this can they do, without the consent of Congress, as is expressly declared in the close of the 1st article. The duty which Congress may, and it is probable will lay on the importation of slaves, will form a branch of their revenue; but his impost, as well as all others, must be uniform throughout the United States; Congress therefore cannot consent that one state should impose an additional duty on this article of commerce, unless all the other states should do the same; and it is not very likely that some of the states will ever ask this favour. (4.) Congress cannot interfere with the opening of rivers and canals; the making or regulation of roads, except post roads; building bridges; erecting ferries; building light-houses, etc. -In one case, which may very frequently happen, this proposition also fails; for if the river, canal, road, bridge, ferry, etc. be common to two states, or a matter in which they may be both concerned, and consequently must both concur, then the interference and consent of Congress becomes absolutely necessary; since it is declared in the constitution that no State shall, without the consent of Congress, enter into any agreement or compact with another State. (5.) The elections of the President, Vice President, senators and representatives are exclusively in the hands of the States-even as to filling vacancies. This, in one important part, is not true-for, by the 2d article, in case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice-President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, etc. both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected; but no such election is provided for by the constitution, till the return of the periodical election, at the expiration of the four years for which the former president was chosen. And thus may the great projects of this supreme magistrate of the United States be exercised, for years together, by a man who, perhaps, never had one vote of the people for any office of government in his life. (6.) Congress cannot interfere with the constitution of any state. This has been often said, but alas! with how little truth! since it is declared in the 6th article that this constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties, etc. shall be the supreme law of the land, and every state, shall be bound thereby-any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. But, sir, in order to form a proper judgment of the probable effects of this plan of general government on the sovereignties of the several states, it is necessary also to take a view of what Congress may, constitutionally, do, and of what the states may not do. This matter, however, the above writer has thought proper to pass over in silence: I would therefore beg leave, in some measure, to supply this omission, and if in any thing, I should appear to be mistaken I hope he will take the same liberty with me that I have done 3· 13·5 with him-he will correct my mistake. I. Congress may, even in time of peace, raise an army of 100,000 men, whom they may canton through the several states, and billet out on the inhabitants, in order to serve as necessary instruments in executing their decrees. 2. Upon the inhabitants of any state proving refractory to the will of Congress, or upon any other pretence whatsoever, Congress may call out even all the militia of as many states as they think proper, and keep them in actual service, without pay, as long as they please, subject to the utmost rigor of military discipline, corporal punishment, and death itself not excepted. 3. Congress may levy and collect a capitation or poll tax, to what amount they shall think proper; of which the poorest taxable in the state must pay as much as the richest. 4. Congress may, under the sanction of that clause in the constitution which empowers them to regulate commerce, authorize the importation of slaves, even into those states where this iniquitous trade is, or may be prohibited by their laws or constitution. 5. Congress may, under the sanction of that clause which empowers them to lay and collect duties (as distinct from imposts and excises) impose so heavy a stamp-duty on newspapers and other periodical publications, as shall effectually prevent all necessary information to the people through these useful channels of intelligence. 6. Congress may, by imposing a duty on foreigners coming into the country, check the progress of its population; and after a few years they may prohibit altogether, not only the emigration of foreigners into our country, but also that of our own citizens to any other country. 7. Congress may withhold, as long as they shall think proper, all information respecting their proceedings from the people. 8. Congress may order the elections for members of their own body, in the several states, to be held at what times, in what places, and in what manner they shall think proper. Thus, in Pennsylvania, they may order the elections to be held in the middle of winter, at the city of Philadelphia; by which means the inhabitants of nine tenths of the state will be effectually (tho constitutionally) deprived of the exercise of their right of suffrage. 9. Congress may, in their courts of judicature, abolish trial by jury, in civil cases, altogether; and even in criminal cases, trial by a jury of the vicinage is not secured by the constitution-A crime committed at Fort-Pitt may be tried by a jury of the citizens of Philadelphia. I IO. Congress may, if they shall think it for the .. general welfare, establish an uniformity in religion throughout the United States. Such establishments have been thought necessary, and have accordingly taken place in almost all the other countries in the world, and will, no doubt, be thought equally necessary in this. I. Though I believe it not generally so understood, yet certain it is, that Congress may emit paper money. and even make it a legal tender throughout the United States, and, what is still worse, may, after it shall have depreciated in the hands of the people, call it in by taxes, at any rate of depreciation (compared with gold and silver) which they may think proper. For though no state can emit bills of credit, or pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, yet the Congress themselves are under no constitutional restraints on these points. 12. The number of representatives which will compose the principal branch of Congress is so small as to occasion general complaint; Congress, however, have no power to encrease the number of representatives, but may reduce it even to one fifth part of the present arrangement. 13. On the other hand-No state can call forth its militia even to suppress any insurrection or domestic violence which may take place among its own citizens-This power is, by the constitution, vested in Congress. 14. No state can compel one of its own citizens to pay a debt due to a citizen of a neighbouring state. Thus a Jersey-man will be unable to recover the price of a turkey, sold in the Philadelphia market, if the purchaser shall be inclined to dispute, without commencing an action in one of the federal courts. 15. No state can encourage its own manufactures either by prohibiting, or even laying a duty on the importation of foreign articles. 16. No state can given relief to insolvent debtors, however distressing their situation may be; since Congress will have the exclusive right of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States; and the particular states are expressly prohibited from passing any law impairing the obligation of contracts.

Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/22/1788,"To THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. Fellow-Citizens, There are few of the maxims or opinions we hold, that are the result of our own investigation or observation, and even those we adopt from others are seldom on a conviction of their truth or propriety, but from the facination of example and the influence of what is or appears to be the general sentiment. The science of government being the most abstruse and unobvious of all others, mankind are more liable to be imposed upon by the artful and designing in systems and regulations of government, than on any other subject: hence a jealousy of innovation confirmed by uniform experience prevails in most communities; this reluctance to change, has been found to be the greatest security of free governments, and the principal bulwark of liberty; for the aspiring and ever-restless spirit of ambition would otherwise, by her deceptive wiles and ensnaring glosses, triumph over the freest and most enlightened people. It is the peculiar misfortune of the people of these United States, at this awful crisis of public affairs, to have lost this useful, this absolutely necessary jealousy of innovation in government, and thereby to lie at the mercy and be exposed to all the artifices of ambition, without this usual shield to protect them from imposition. The conspirators, well aware of their advantage, have seized the favorable moment, and by the most unparalleled arts of deception, have obtained the sanction of the conventions of several states to the most tyrannic system of government ever projected. The magic of great names, the delusion of falsehood, the suppression of information, precipitation and fraud have been the instruments of this partial success, the pillars whereon the structure of tyranny has been so far raised. Those influential vehicles, the newspapers with few exceptions, have been devoted to the cause of despotism, and by the subserviency of the P- 0-, the usefulness of the patriotic newspapers has been confined to the places of their publication, whilst falsehood and deception have had universal circulation, without the opportunity of refutation. The feigned unanimity of one part of America, has been represented to produce the acquiescence of another, and so mutually to impose upon the whole by the force of example. The adoption of the new constitution by the convention of the state of Massachusetts, by a majority of nineteen out of near four hundred members, and that too qualified by a number of propositions of amendment, cannot afford the conspirators much cause for triumph, and especially when all the circumstances under which it has been obtained, are considered. The late alarming disorders which distracted that state, and even threatened subversion of all order and government, and were with difficulty suppressed, occasioned the greatest consternation among all men of property and rank: in this disposition even the most high toned and arbitrary government became desirable as a security against licentiousness and agrarian laws; consequently the new constitution was embraced with eagerness by men of these descriptions, who, in every community, form a powerful interest, and added to the conspirators, office-hunters, &c. &c. made a formidable and numerous party in favor of the new constitution. The elections of the members of convention were moreover made in the first moments of blind enthusiasm, when every artifice was practised to prejudice the people against all those who had the enlightened patriotism to oppose this system of tyranny: thus was almost every man of real ability, who was in opposition, excluded from a seat in the convention; consequently the contest was very unequal; well-meaning, though uninformed men, were opposed to great learning, eloquence and sophistry in the shape of lawyers, doctors and divines, who were capable and seemed disposed to delude by deceptive glosses and specious reasoning; indeed, from the specimens we have seen of the discussion on this occasion, every enlightened patriot must regret that the cause of liberty has been so weakly, although jealously advocated, that its champions were so little illuminated. In addition to these numerous advantages in the convention, the friends of the new constitution had the weight and influence of the town of Boston to second their endeavors, and yet, notwithstanding all this, were near losing the question, although delusively qualified. Is this any evidence of the excellency of the new constitution? Certainly not. Nor can it have any influence in inducing the remaining states to accede. They will examine and judge for themselves, and from their wisdom in taking due time for deliberation, I have no doubt will prove the salvation of the liberties of the United States. Philadelphia, February 20th, 1788."

Perhaps you could furnish us with a peice to publish by way of retaliation for the letter under the Carlisle head said [to] be from a Getleman in the Mercantile line in Philadelphia but I am certain was done in Carlisle�Both the Clergymen in this town are against us, but particularly Davidson8 is our inviterate enemy, he declares he-ll leave the Congregation if the mob (as he calls them) that opposed the rejoicing is not prosecuted with rigor; the truth is he is an insignificant tool to the mock gentry here. John Chriegh is our most Malicious enemy:9 the reason why I mention these, is, that it is supposed, you and some other of our friends in the City, have derected intelegence to them (they being formerly proffesed friends to the constitution of Pensylvania) intended for us, and they have suppressed it, and we been deprived of usefull information. The people here in this County and Franklin [696]County are forming Societys for the purpose of opposing this detastable Fedrall conspiracy: we almost every day here of some new society of this nature being formed, it is proposed to have agenral meeting in the spring, consisting of delegates from the sevral township and societys in the Countys of York Dauphin Cumberland and Franklin.10 perhaps if some persons from Phia. and the lower Countys could be procured to meet along with them, their meeting might be of more extensive utility. the Society in the City might consider of this and send their opinion to the Commitee in this town, it is proposed to chuse the delegates at the township meetings in March for the purpose of chusing Township officers. the People in this County is so much enraged against the sticklers for new Constitution that agreat number of them have resolved to have no dealings with them either Social or Comercial this is bringing some of the Federal Merchants and Taveran-keepers to astate of repentance for the active part they have taken in its favour but whether their repentance will be unto life or unto death I shall not take upon me to determine"
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/26/1788,"To THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. Fellow-Citizens, The new constitution instead of being the panecea or cure of every grievance so delusively represented by its advocates will be found upon examination like Pandora�s box, replete with every evil. The most specious clauses of this system of ambition and iniquity contain latent mischief, and premedated villainy. By section 9th of the 1st article, �No ex post facto law shall be passed.� This sounds very well upon a superficial consideration, and I dare say has been read by most people with approbation. Government undoubtedly ought to avoid retrospective laws as far as may be, as they are generally injurious and fraudulent: Yet there are occasions when such laws are not only just but highly requisite. An ex post facto law is a law made after the fact, so that the Congress under the new constitution are precluded from all controul over transactions prior to its establishment. This prohibition would skreen the numerous public defaulters, as no measure could be constitutionally taken to compel them to render an account and restore the public money; the unaccounted millions lying in their hands would become their private property. Hitherto these characters from their great weight and numbers have had the influence to prevent an investigation of their accounts, but if this constitution be established, they may set the public at defiance, as they would be completely exonerated of all demands of the United States against them. This is not a strained construction of this section, but the proper evident meaning of the words, which not even the ingenuity, or sophistry of the Caledonian, can disguise from the meanest capacity. However if this matter admitted of any doubt, it would be removed by the following consideration, viz. that the new constitution is founded upon a dissolution of the present articles of confederation and is an original compact between those states, or rather those individuals who accede to it; consequently all contracts, debts and engagements in favor or against the United States, under the old government, are cancelled unless they are provided for in the new constitution. The framers of this constitution appear to have been aware of such consequence by stipulating in article 6th, that all debts contracted, and engagements entered into before the adoption of this constitution shall be valid against the United States under the new constitution, but there is no provision that the debts, &c. due to the United States, shall be valid or recoverable. This is a striking omission, and must have been designed, as debts of the latter description would naturally occur and claim equal attention with the former. This article implied, cancels all debts due to the United States prior to the establishment of the new constitution. If equal provision had been made for the debts due to the United States, as against the United States, the ex post facto clause would not have so pernicious an operation. The immaculate convention, that is said to have possessed the fullness of patriotism, wisdom and virtue, contained a number of the principal public defaulters; and these were the most influential members, and chiefly instrumental in the framing of the new constitution: There were several of this description in the deputation from the state of Pennsylvania, who have long standing and immense accounts to settle, and MILLIONS perhaps to refund. The late Financier alone, in the capacity of chairman of the commercial committee of Congress, early in the late war, was entrusted with millions of public money, which to this day remain unaccounted for, nor has he settled his accounts as Financier. The others may also find it a convenient method to balance accounts with the public; they are sufficiently known and therefore need not be designated�This will account for the zealous attachment of such characters to the new constitution and their dread of investigation and discussion. It may be said that the new Congress would rather break through the constitution than suffer the public to be defrauded of so much treasure, when the burthens and distresses of the people are so very great; but this is not to be expected from the characters of which that Congress would in all probability be composed, if we may judge from the predominant influence and interest these defaulters now possess in many of the states. Besides, should Congress be disposed to violate the fundamental articles of the constitution for the sake of public justice, they would be prevented in so doing by their oaths,(a) but even if this should not prove an obstacle, if it can be supposed that any set of men would perjure themselves for the public good, and combat an host of enemies on such terms, still it would be of no avail, as there is a further barrier interposed between the public and these defaulters, namely, the supreme court of the union, whose province it would be to determine the constitutionality of any law that may be controverted; and supposing no bribery or corrupt influence practised on the bench of judges, it would be their sworn duty to refuse their sanction to laws made in the face and contrary to the letter and spirit of the constitution, as any law to compel the settlement of accounts and payment of monies depending and due under the old confederation would be. The 1st section of 3d article gives the supreme court cognizance of not only the laws, but of all cases arising under the constitution, which empowers this tribunal to decide upon the construction of the constitution itself in the last resort. This is so extraordinary, so unprecedented an authority, that the intention in vesting of it must have been to put it out of the power of Congress, even by breaking through the constitution, to compel these defaulters to restore the public treasure. In the present circumstances these sections of the new constitution would be also productive of great injustice between the respective states; the delinquent states would be exonerated from all existing demands against them on account of the great arrearages of former requisitions, as they could not be constitutionally compelled to discharge them. And as the majority of the states are in this predicament, and have an equal voice in the senate, it would be their interest, and in their power by not only the constitution, but by a superiority of votes to prevent the levying of such arrearages; besides, the constitution, moreover, declares, that all taxes, &c. shall be uniform throughout the United States; which is an additional obstacle against noticing them. The state of Pennsylvania in such case, would have no credit for her extraordinary exertions and punctuality heretofore; but would be taxed equally with those states which, for years past, have not contributed any thing to the common expences of the union; indeed, some of the states have paid nothing since the revolution. Philadelphia, 23d February, 1788. (a) Article VI. �The senators and representatives beforementioned and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath to support this constitution. � Were ever public defaulters so effectually skreened! Not only the administrators of the general government, but also of the state governments, are prevented by oath from doing justice to the public; and the legislature of Pennsylvania could not without perjury insist upon the delinquent states discharging their arrears."
Letter,Yes,,,Carlisle Gazette,,2/27/1788,"Extract of a letter from a merchant in Philadelphia, to his friend in this town… “There is some reason to doubt of the adoption of the constitution, yet there is accounts that Massachusetts hath adopted it with amendments, which is but a decent way of rejecting it.…”"
Letter,No,James Bowdoin,James de Caledonia,Independent Gazetteer,,2/27/1788,"To the Right Hon. James de Caledonia. Dear Sir, I duly received yours of the 24th January, containing very disagreeable accounts of our scheme being so ably opened up, and of the people falling off from you, &c. it made us very unhappy here; however do not despond; I am glad to find you have got your �writing committee,�1 appointed, and employed: I confess what you say is just, and that there is somewhat disagreeable in writing, with the argument against you, and with able compettitors. In your two first numbers of the Freemen and Pennsylvanian,2 to be sure you exceed yourself: But I would not advise you to continue the publication of them in the city, they will suit better for the country; ha, ha, ha: You make bold assertions; you should take care not to let it be known who the author of them is, the very name of a lawyer would ruin a publication in our country. Keep your committee hard at it; and fill your weekly paper3 from top to bottom: Your notion of answering your own pieces may do, if not found out. Do try by all means to regain your lost ground, leave no stone unturned; much is gained by confusing the business, and you are really a compleat sophist: You know your reward should it succeed; we have all agreed you shall have �.8000 per annum, with the office of Attorney General (of the union.) As to the office of Chief Justice4 which you wished for, it would have been yours, but, necessity obliged us to close with J�y�5 it was his price. I was glad to find you had stopped the publication of the debates of your convention;6 and that you had suited your own so well to the tune; you was very right to hold back the second volume containing the speeches of the minority, as perhaps the real ones might come out. But I was sorry you could not silence the press entirely:7 However as we have the P�t O�ce still at our service,8 you must prevent any of the newspapers which contain publications against us, getting out of your state. We have been remarkably successful in this hitherto; every newspaper against us has been stopped, even the reasons of dissent of your minority, and the information of Mr. Martin, has been scarcely heard of here;9 this was very fortunate, as it would certainly have ruined us in this quarter. So great was the want of information here, that we made the people believe all to the southward [239]of us, indeed that every state but our own were almost unanimous in favor of our plan. You would have laughed to have seen our newspapers on the day the final question was taken in our convention; there we published an account of the almost unanimous adoption of the constitution by the convention of North-Carolina; that the state of New-York had called a convention at a very early day, without any opposition; and the trifling opposition in your state had ceased; that Randolph, Mason, Lee, &c. had joined our party;10 and many other similar accounts. In this situation, when such a variety of circumstances concurred in our favor; although we had juggled in above 50 members of the convention, by the assistance of country friends; and was so fortunate as to keep out any Ciceros from the opposition in the convention: Although we bought off the province of Main with the feather of a separate state;11 although we had such a number of able hands, among which were many as complete sophists as yourself; although we gained the man of the people by holding out to him the office of Vice President;12 although we had the influence of the town of Boston to assist us,13 still we would have lost the question almost two to one if we had not agreed to the amendments, which you find included in the ratification; and these not to be made by the first Congress as you proposed, but according to the 5th article, that is, by another convention.14 This was a fatal stroke, but we could not avoid it. You have seen with much surprise, I dare say, the great parade we made at the ratification;15 it cost us a considerable sum, but I am in hopes it will be of great service, these things have great effect on common minds.�You see we have the town of Boston under our discipline; I wish I could say so of the rest of the state, indeed it is far otherwise, four fifths of the people are against us: But as you say, what need we care for the sentiments of the people, if we can only get the army a-foot. I was happy to hear you was disarming your militia both for your own safety,16 and because you will want the arms for the troops; but at the same time I thought it a bold push, and might cause alarm. I have lately received a letter from Mr. J�A�, our A�d-r at London, he is pleased with my compliment on his volume, it was, I told him of much service to us.17 He has endeavoured through Bobby�s18 credit, to contract for the necessaries we wrote for; but he found it would not do: He then pledged the faith of the United States to fulfil the contracts he has made. He has also entered into other treaties for the other articles, which I shall be more particular about, by a safer opportunity.19 When these things were told to our friends here, many of them began to stare; for they consider the matter as lost since this state, which, they say, is the most important in the union, has called for amendments; the people of your state, the states of Virginia, New-York, North-Carolina, and Maryland so generally against it: to be sure, matters look blue; but I am in hopes still that our exertions will be crowned with success. You know [240]that you or I have nothing to lose, and much to gain. Some of our milk and water friends here think we had better stop, and submit again to another convention; because, say they, we will be envolved in a civil war, if we persist; but I tell them we will not give it up while any hopes remain; as now, we are found out, we shall never be trusted in another convention; and so we shall lose every thing. But if we succeed in this plan, we shall never again be troubled with the people, never dread the event of elections; we shall enjoy our places, honors, and preferments, and leave them to our children after us. We shall be able to keep the people at a proper distance, and establish our numerous friends and relations in lucrative and substantial offices. Present my compliments to Bobby, and also to Billy in the new big house;20 and tell them I congratulate them upon the prospect of all their old continental balances being done away;21 as I don�t find that part of the constitution is yet discovered. You are an admirable man, the most useful in the convention; but you was rather for taking too much at one time; the double powers of our little sexentially elected senate; the controul over the press; the abolition of trial by jury in civil cases, and the common law proceedings; internal taxation; the pecuniary dependency of the judges, and their great powers; the standing army; the smallness of the lower house; the exclusion of rotation; and the �powers to make all laws which we may think necessary and proper.� And that these laws and the treaties of the little senate should be the supreme law of the land, over the constitutions and laws of the several states. These would have been quite sufficient for us; with them alone we could chain down all America; we might have given up the rest to the winds: the controul over the elections; the command of the militia; the power of the senate to alter money bills; the powers of president to pardon criminals, to command in person the armies, navies, and militia, &c. and his long appointment, his right of being re-elected; omission of declarations in favor of liberty of conscience, and twenty others, which have been of great hurt to us, might have been left out. But between you and me, they will never discover some of the most exceptionable parts. I suppose you will soon hear of its adoption by New-Hampshire; but it will be many months before any other can come into it. Pray, inform me how Martin is going on; I hope he will be persuaded to discontinue his publications; we have sent him an offer of the office of chief justice of the federal court of his state, but I am afraid of him.22 We have gained much by deceiving one part of the continent, with plausible accounts from the other; pray, do not discontinue this; have you no more town or county meetings to publish? What M�23 says is very true; almost all of our strength lies in the trading towns; and his remark is just that they would consent to go to the devil, if they thought they could again sell as many British goods, as they formerly did. Keep up the spirits of your boys, and exert you[r]selves; I shall write you again shortly. I am, dear sir, Your most obedient, And very humble servant, J. B-wd-n."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/7/1788,"A real state of the proposed constitution in the United States. Adopted by the delinquent counties of Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Georgia: that is, by a few leading men in those counties; for the people in them, have never been allowed any information on this important business, their news-papers having been all mufled by these leading characters. Still the opposition to it among the people in those states is considerable. In the state of Pennsylvania it was adopted by an illegal mob convention, under the direction of the city junto: the majority in this convention were only elected by about 1�12th2 of the suffrages of the freemen of the state: And so entirely against the real sense of the state that it will be all undone. In the state of Massachusetts, above three-fourths of the people are warmly opposed to it, even the friends of it themselves would not dare to adopt it without considerable amendment. Much fraud at the election of that convention. Maryland, three-fourths of that state are against it since the press has been opened; convention to meet the latter end of April, supposed they will adjourn till they see what their sister southern states will do. Virginia, 4�5ths of the people3 and most of the leading characters are decided against it; their convention not to meet till June. That state will not allow Congress farther than commercial and such general powers, and the impost. They will not allow standing armies, &c. nor part with that grand bulwark of freedom, annual elections and rotation. North-Carolina is generally opposed to it, convention meets late in July, she will act the same part that Virginia will. South-Carolina convention meets 12th May, but supposed she will adjourn till July. The country interest, which is two to one in that state, is opposed to it. New-Hampshire convention adjourned to the third Wednesday in June (to meet in Concord) three-fourths of that state have instructed their respective deputies to vote against it. New-York convention meets 17th June; except in the city there is few advocates for it: it is expected the city members will be alone in the convention in favor of it. Rhode-Island, it is almost certain will have nothing to do with it, except it is reduced down to a federal government. The friends of the proposed constitution will now have to tread back every step they have taken, the people have now discovered their schemes, and will come forward to defend their liberties which was in such danger of being overturned. The system of deception practised by its advocates, is pretty generally found out by the people; their arts of making each place on the continent believe that every other part but their own was in favor of it, will serve them no longer.

Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/8/1788,"My Fellow Citizens, Every day opens a new scene of the baseness of the conspirators, their intentions of screening themselves from rendering an account of the public money so fraudulently detained, will rank them among the meanest traitors, that ever dishonoured the human character.2 How must their consciences condemn them, when avarice and lust of dominion are suffered for a moment to subside, and reason and reflection take their place? Let these men but cooly consider the misery that must inevitably befal millions of their countrymen, in consequence of their treachery in framing this system of fraud and oppression; and remorse and deep anguish of soul must await them! Humanity brings a tear of sympathetic pity from the eye of their fellow men, whose ruin they had secretly projected. As our holy religion expressly enjoins it as a duty, not to return evil for evil, but to overcome evil with good;3 consequently our resentment against these ungrateful men should be moderated by christian charity: Yet as freemen and citizens, determined to hand down to posterity sacred liberty unimpaired, we are solemnly bound, at the hazard of our fortunes and lives, to oppose this base attempt of theirs to enslave our country. If on the broad basis of equity and justice, crimes and punishments have their proper proportion: What punishment then, on the scale of moderation, could counterpoise, or atone, for a crime so aggravated as that charged to the majority of the members of the late federal convention? I assert roundly, that another assembly of men never met in this, or any other country, possessing so fully the confidence of so many freemen: and to their shame be it said, they abused this confidence; their own private interest, private emolument, and hopes of dominion, overcame every consideration of duty, honor, and gratitude. The citizens of Pennsylvania have nobly shown their love for liberty, and attachment to the true interests of the union, by their generous exertions in favor of public credit. They have rigidly fulfilled their engagements in regard to the general debt; the requisitions of Congress have been strictly attended to, and fully answered.4 Add to this, that we have sunk a considerable part of the domestic debt, and in fact assumed a larger portion of it than in justice belonged to us.5 These spirited exertions, while they contributed to the general welfare of the union, and raised the reputation of the state, did not fail however to distress our farmers and every other class and description of citizens, very sensibly indeed. But what is the result of their unshaken loyalty to the cause of liberty, and the honor of their country? What recompence will the honest and industrious Pennsylvanians receive for their patriotism, if the new government be established? Such a return as perhaps history does not afford a single instance similar to. So base a violation of public justice and plighted faith, is certainly a novelty in politics, and begins a new epoch in history. [364]Pennsylvania, instead of receiving credit for the immense sums she has paid into the general treasury, will be placed on a footing with the most delinquent state in the union; and which is highly probable she and all the other states will be taxed hereafter in an exact ratio of the sums they have hitherto raised. Consequently our former acts of generosity, in support of public faith, is to terminate in a two-fold loss to our citizens. In the first place we have nearly ruined ourselves already, through our punctuality in paying our quota of the public debt; and secondly, to complete the scene, our future quotas of continental revenue will be apportioned to the exertions we have heretofore made: That is in plain terms, Pennsylvania will be much worse under this cruel system of tyranny in consequence of her fidelity and honor, than she would have been had she never attempted to pay a shilling of public debt; or if she be not worse, the uniformity of internal taxation through the union, which is expressly stipulated by the constitution, necessarily places her citizens on a parallel with those of that state which has not paid a shilling of public debt since the peace. The people of the delinquent states might inconsiderately be induced to triumph in the new system of government; for they may conclude, now our public debts are paid as far forward as those of any other state, but attentive consideration will soon convince them of their mistake. Although the new constitution advances them as high in the public scale as if they had strictly and honorably made good the requisitions of the old Congress; yet the unbounded powers of the new Congress in respect to internal taxation, must eventually fleece them of their all; and from their inability heretofore to pay their just quotas as levied by Congress, we may rationally conclude, that, even the states of Pennsylvania and New-York,6 which are in advance at present, will still be above them, supposing the extra payments of these two states not to be carried to the credit of their account, which they certainly will not, on the principles of this constitution. The truth of this matter is simply this; the taxes will hereafter be uniform in all the states, and as oppressive as tyranny can make them. In every state the face of the poor must be ground to dust; and where any appearance of prosperity or wealth is observed, an additional tax will be devised; for so complicated and uncontrouled a government, will find ways and means to apply all the revenue that America can raise; indeed the whole produce of the lands cultivated by three millions and an half of people, could not satiate the desires of such a government. If the lesser, or rather weaker states would moderate their precipitancy, in urging forward the constitution, by reason and the certainty of misery that stares them in the face, I imagine they would find their advantage in the measure. Lenity in the old Congress has in some degree screened them; and besides their fellow citizens in the other states befriend them; but the high hand of power, so completely vested in the new Congress, will exact the uttermost farthing, both from the states and individuals: No excuse will satisfy the [365]demands of a cruel excise-man; we must instantly pay the federal tax, or have our property seized, and ourselves dragged to prison by a federal soldier. That this government, should it be ratified by nine states, will not possess the confidence of the majority of the people, is a truth incontrovertible. I admit, that through fraud and surprise, many have inconsiderately joined themselves to its deceptive standard; but their number is diminishing rapidly; and I sincerely believe, that in a few months the office-hunters, the well born, and their sycophants, will be left alone: The farmer, the mechanic, and even the merchant, would be ruined if it took effect; their interest is to oppose it, and to endeavor to have another convention called immediately. Who is so dimsighted as to suppose that a constitution so essentially differing from the principles of the revolution, and from freedom, and opposed by so respectable a body of freemen, could be established in America; or if it were possible by force or surprise to put it in motion, could it exist any space of time? Nay, the idea is futile, and common sense spurns at it. While it would exist, it must be by the power of a standing army alone; but its warmest advocates know, that all their credit, and influence could not support a standing army, equal to the business, six months. It is admitted, that in Great Britain they are scarce ever without violent factions and parties, and yet no injury is apprehended to the country on that account, but generally much good: But let us attend to this matter seriously, and we must see clearly that factions and parties in America in respect to the present important object, would eventually ruin this country. The parties, factions, and cabals, so frequent in Britain, are not from a dislike to the fundamentals of their constitution, but on account of maladministration: All parties glory in the constitution, and disagree only, when it is infringed, or violated. To infer then, from the example of Britain, that the opposition to the new government would not terminate in our ruin, if it were adopted by a majority in nine states, would be a dangerous mistake; for there is no analogy between the premises, the conclusions are therefore different. The opposition in America is against the fundamentals of the constitution itself; but this is not so in England. No constitution that is not popular can possibly be established in America; or if for a short time it were established, we would have nothing but anarchy and civil war, while it was in existence. Let us not be deceived by delusive tales, that it shall be amended after the meeting of the first Congress; since it is admitted almost universally that it wants amendments; now is the time to have them done, while we are at peace abroad, and among ourselves. A fragment of liberty cannot remain, if we once set it in motion in its imperfect state. How can we [366]suppose, that the president general, being once in full possession of his unlimited powers, would deliver them back again to the people; the supposition is preposterous; he must be more than man if he would; a more dangerous king is not in the world than he will be; liberty will be lost in America the day on which he is proclaimed, and must be recovered by the sword, if ever we are to enjoy it again."

Newspaper,No,Eleazer Oswald,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/12/1788,"The printer of this paper2 earnestly solicits the attention of the public with regard to his situation�a situation in which he presumes not only all the printers, but every freeman in this country, will conceive themselves very deeply concerned. He knows not on what ground the Centinel ventured to charge the postmasters with unfair deportment in the circulation of newspapers. Upon a liberal investigation of the subject, he cheerfully acquits Mr. Bryson, the gentleman who has the management of the post-office in this city. The Printers early represented to him that they did not receive an exchange of their newspapers as usual. He introduced their complaints to his principal, Ebenezer Hazard, Esq. post-master general. His answer,3 far from affording the desired redress, contained a resolution, under his new arrangement, as he terms it, to persevere in the same line of conduct, to lord it over the printers, and thereby prevent the free communication of the sentiments of the people, in an impartial and unrestrained circulation of newspapers [558]through the channel of the post-office. The eastern mails have arrived for several weeks past, and no papers have been received by the printers, except a few from some inconsiderable towns in the states of Connecticut and New-York, and now and then, by way of grace and favor, a single solitary paper from Boston or New-York.4 This is the situation of the printers here; a situation truly alarming, and deserving the immediate attention of the people themselves at large. When the vehicles of intelligence are closed at this alarming crisis, by the vile edicts of a despotic post-master: when the venerable usages of the country from time immemorial, are invaded to answer the dirty purposes of faction and party, or to gratify high-throned authority, and printers are debarred of their ancient privileges of interchanging their newspapers, let any man in his sober senses say whether Americans are not degraded from their rank as freemen into that of slaves and vassals. Such oppressions and atrocious exercises of power, were never expected in the morning of our peace and independency, when the great orb of freedom uplifted his beamy head �to chace the shades of night:� nor will they now bear the test of light. The post-office, in its creation and establishment, was evidently intended for the good of the people, not for the emolument of a few of their servants and retainers. Hence arose the privileges now claimed by the printers of a mutual intercourse of newspapers through the channel of the post office: and until now never did a post-master, not even in the hot moments of royal zeal or stamp-act fury, assume a right to discontinue the communication of intelligence in this way. As old as the post-office itself, it has been customary for post-masters to despatch the papers of printers. This custom is therefore an established, uninterrupted custom of the country, that has antiquity, sterling antiquity, on its side; and as such is as obligatory as any positive law of the land. What right can the post-master general have to violate permanent laws and usages? Is he an officer of the public, and bound to adhere to such laws, or are the people the humble captives and tenants of his will and pleasure? Shall respectable rules and regulations fall a prey to his flimsey systems and temporising ARRANGEMENTS, or must his discretion submit to well concerted rules, sanctioned by experience, having a reference to the common welfare, and not accommodated to times or things, local or partisanning circumstances? A more oppressive engine could not be pointed at the press, nor levelled at the vitals of the printers. �Tis to martyr freedom, and shake our privileges from the centre to the extremities. Printing presses can never be better employed than in defending the birth-rights of the people; and the dignity of the post-office is not to be preserved by the arbitrary hand of power, and an overbearing disposition towards the printers, or in sowing the seeds of jealousy and discord. On the contrary, true dignity consists in looking after and supporting the general good, in which every citizen in a greater or lesser degree is equally [559]interested. Tyrants and despots may flourish like a bay tree, and look green for a-while�But there is a time for all things, and monsters and oppressors are sure to wither. Having offered these sentiments, which are purely from the printer�s known attachment to the Freedom of the Press, he would willingly close. But as endeavors have been made to injure his paper, he would claim a moments more indulgence on the occasion. Since the promulgation of the new scheme of government, several strictures appearing in this paper, under divers signatures, have given offence to some of its most zealous friends and advocates; and, in order to display the length of their revenge on the printer, have withdrawn their subscriptions,5 and the most ungenerous means have been essayed to persuade others to pursue their path and follow the example. But let such persons now be told, that the only fault they could find with the printer, he flatters himself, was his love of integrity and impartiality. Freely has he published respective pieces relative to federal measures, both for and against the new constitution. No restrictions were on his paper�nor has partiality ever shewn her pallid face. What crime or offence has he committed in supporting an impartial line of conduct in his office? Is this the reason his paper should be treated as diffusing licentiousness, faction and rebellion? And is it for this the pigmy prophet DANIEL, the incessant trumpeter of the fugitive productions of Galen and his infamous disciples, attempts to dishonor the Independent Gazetteer, and to proclaim its approaching destiny:6 These base attempts to prejudice the printer and his family, he is happy to find, have, on trial, proved abortive�they could not be otherwise, as they sprung from base born minds and principles�For many of his fellow citizens, considering the procedures of his enemies as unworthy and illiberal, have repelled the premeditated injury, and generously contributed to the support of his paper, by enrolling their names as subscribers, and advancing their monies."
Newspaper,,,,Freeman's Journal,,3/12/1788,"Even the partial success of the new Constitution (says a correspondent) is now at an end: its advocates themselves now give the matter over, tho� they set the best face on their affairs. The four trifling States of Delaware, Connecticut, Georgia and Jersey, have adopted it, but this was only obtained by precipitancy, the suppression of discussion, and the stoppage of newspapers in the Post-Office; the leaders in these states too were led into it, in some measure, by their states being delinquent, and by the new system they would be discharged from repaying to Pennsylvania, &c. vast sums she lent the Union.2 Pennsylvania is said to have adopted it; but it is far otherwise, it was done only by one twelfth of the people, and illegally too.3 Massachusetts has been procured by a very small majority, and that too with considerable amendments. New-Hampshire convention has adjourned till summer; 100 miles farther back in the country; above three fourths of that convention are instructed to vote against it. The other State Conventions will be all opposed to it; they do not meet this long time. Would it not be adviseable to recommend a general thanksgiving throughout the State, to that Providence which has thus defeated such a deep laid scheme against the peace and happiness of America. It has been the constant practice of the advocates of the new Constitution, ever since its publication, to abuse the characters of all who differed in opinion with them, and in the same moment to extol to the heavens the characters of its advocates; thus we find in the beginning of their paragraphs the illustrious, pious, magnanimous names of its friends, and in the conclusion the nefarious, villainarious, and scoundelarious names of Gerry, Martin, Lee, Clinton, Mason, &c. who have been constantly abused with torrents of scurrility: But when a part of the new system is discovered, which makes it necessary to call on the public defaulters and delinquent States for the millions detained by them from the public treasury, as they will by this system be skreened from public justice; Oh they then cry out, Shame upon you, low born gentry, to call such grand big men public defaulters, their characters are sacred; it is blasphemy to touch their names: if they owe the public millions, the people must sit down and bear it patiently, without so much as a murmur."

One of the most wealthy of these chaps, (who [407]was a member of the federal convention) took out 300 writs at one time, and had them executed in the most rigorous manner.

The effigies passing near the door of the court, His Honor Mr. Cannon, who was then sitting on the bench, thinking his dignity wounded, ordered the officers of the court to assist his partisans in apprehending the effigy-men, which they effected in part (as they were not numerous), and a number of persons were thrown into jail. Immediately the county took the alarm, assembled, and liberated the sons of liberty, so unjustly confined; who passed down the jail steps, under loud huzzas and repeated acclamations of joy from a large concourse of people; who soon after retired from the town declaring their intention to duck the junto if they repeated their insults."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/24/1788,"To THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. Fellow-Citizens, In my last number I exposed the villainous intention of the framers of the new constitution, to defraud the public out of the millions lying in the hands of individuals by the construction of this system, which would, if established, cancel all debts now due to the United States. I also chewed that thereby the delinquent states would be exonerated of all arrearages due by them on former requisitions of Congress; and to prove that the cancelling of the public dues was premeditated in regard to individuals, I stated that the general convention contained a number of the principal public defaulters, and that these were the most influential members, and chiefly instrumental in framing the new constitution: In answer to which, the conspirators have, by bold assertions, spurious vouchers, and insufficient certificates, endeavoured to exculpate one member, and to alleviate the weight of the charge of delinquency against another. In the face of a resolution of Congress of the 20th June, 1785, declaring their intention of appointing 3 commissioners, to settle and adjust the receipts and expenditures of the late financier; the conspirators have asserted, that his accounts were finally settled in November, 1784, for which they pretend to have vouchers, and by a pompous display of certain resolutions of Congress, respecting a particular charge of fraud against him, as commercial agent to the United States, they vainly hope to divert the public attention from his great delinquency, in never accounting for the millions of public money, entrusted to him in that line. When we consider the immense sums of money taken up by Mr. M-s, as commercial agent, to import military supplies, and even to trade in behalf of the United States, at a time when the risque was so great, that individuals would not venture their property; that all these transactions were conducted under the private firm of W�g and M�, which afforded unrestrained scope to peculation the loss of all captures by the enemy, at that hazardous period, on the public, and converting most of the safe arrivals (which were consequently very valuable) into his private property; and when we add to these considerations, the principles of the MAN, his bankrupt situation at the commencement of the late war, and the immense wealth he has dazzled the world with since, can it be thought unreasonable to conclude, that the principal source of his affluence was the commercial agency of the United States, during the war, not that I would derogate from his successful ingenuity in his numerous speculations in the paper monies, Havannah monopoly and job, or in the sphere of financiering. The certificate published in behalf of general M-ffl-n, the quarter master gen-l, will not satisfy a discerning public, or acquit him of the charge of delinquency, as this certificate was procured to serve an electioneering purpose, upon a superficial and hasty inspection of his general account, unchecked by the accounts of his deputies, whose receipts and expenditures had not been examined, and consequently, by errors, collusion between him and them, or otherwise g-l M-ffl-n may retain a large balance in his hands; in such case a quietus may have been thought expedient to continue his affluence. For the honor of human nature, I wish to draw a veil over the situation and conduct of another weighty character, whose name has given a false lustre to the new constitution, and been the occasion of sullying the laurels of a Washington, by inducing him to acquiesce in a system of despotism and villainy, at which enlightened patriotism shudders. The discovery of the intended fraud, which for magnitude and audacity, is unparalelled, must open the eyes of the deluded to the true character and principles of the men who had assumed the garb of patriotism, with an insidious design of enslaving and robbing their fellow-citizens�of establishing those odious distinctions between the well born and the great body of the people, of degrading the latter to the level of slaves, and elevating the former to the rank of nobility. The citizens of this state, which is in advance in its payments to the federal treasury, whilst some of the others have not paid a farthing since the war, ought in a peculiar manner to resent the intended imposition, and make its authors experience their just resentment; it is incumbent upon them in a particular manner, to exert themselves to frustrate the measures of the conspirators, and set an example to those parts of the union, who have not enjoyed the blessing of a free press on this occasion, but are still enveloped in the darkness of delusion, and enthralled by the fascination of names. Could it have been supposed seven years ago, that, before the wounds received in the late conflict for liberty were scarcely healed, a post master-general and his deputies would have had the daring presumption to convert an establishment intended to promote and secure the public welfare into an engine of despotism, by suppressing all those newspapers that contain the essays of patriotism and real intelligence, and propagating instead thereof falsehoods and delusion? Such a supposition at that time, would have been treated as chimerical; but how must our indignation rise when we find this flagitious practice is persevered in, after being publicly detected! Must not the bribe from the conspirators be very great to compensate the post master-general and his deputies, for the loss of character and infamy consequent upon such conduct, and for the danger they incur of being impeached and turned out of office? The scurrilous attack of the little Fiddler upon Mr. Workman of the university, on a suspicion, perhaps, unfounded of his being the author of a series of essays under the signature of Philadelphiensis,is characteristical of the man; he has ever been the base parasite and tool of the wealthy and great, at the expence of truth, honor, friendship, treachery to benefactors, nay to the nearest relatives; all have been sacrificed by him at the shrine of the great: he ought however, to have avoided a contrast with so worthy and highly respected a character as Mr. Workman, who had an equal right with himself to offer his sentiments on the new constitution; and if he viewed it as a system of despotism, and had talents to unfold its nature and tendency, he deserves the thanks of every patriotic American, if he has exerted them under the character of Philadelphiensis.�His not being above four years in the country can be no objection; the celebrated Thomas Paine wrote his Common Sense before he had been two years in America, which was not the less useful or acceptable upon that account. The public have nothing to do with the author of a piece; it is the merits of the writing that are alone to be considered.�Mr. Workman, prior to his coming to America, was a professor in an eminent academy in Dublin.�Little Fran-cis should have been cautious in giving provocation, for insignificance alone could have preserved him the smallest remnant of character; I hope he will take the hint, or such a scene will be laid open as will disgrace even his patrons; the suit of cloaths, and the quarter cask of wine, will not be forgot. Philadelphia, March 19th, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Watchman,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/26/1788,"Mr. OSWALD, In yesterday’s paper I observed a publication from Ebenezer Hazard, Esquire, Post Master-General,2 in which he endeavors to exculpate himself from the heavy charges made against him from all parts of the continent of stopping every free paper in the post office, thereby preventing due intelligence getting to the people in the different states at this most important crisis. A heavy charge indeed, an established usage older than our governments, to be broken by a petty officer, and so much [573]against the voice of the people. It is the established creed of America, that the liberty of the press is the palladium of all the civil, political and religious rights of Americans. The newspapers are the best vehicles of intelligence and information, respecting public affairs to the people at large; and to stop their free circulation, is an act of injury and insult to these United States. At no time can it be more necessary to keep open the channels of communication, than the present moment. The great motive for erecting the present post-office in America, was to promote the public good, by facilitating a constant and speedy conveyance of public dispatches and private letters; and the incidental revenue arising from the latter, was but a secondary object. The mutual exchange of newspapers by the printers on this continent, in the mail, was always exercised under the British government, and continued since the revolution, until a few months ago, when the said Ebenezer Hazard, Esquire, prohibited sending any papers in the mail. What must be the feelings of every freeman in America, on the conduct of this little despot in office? And what does he say in his defence? Nothing! A few paltry low evasions, and unsupported assertions make up his performance. Take the alarm all ye lovers of freedom–it is a sample of what you may expect, if the new system of national government should be adopted.–The first symptom of a design on the liberties of America, is the shackling of the press; the second is the cutting off the communication of sentiments in the newspapers.–If the people of America submit to this conduct, nothing can rouse them from their lethargy, and their next sleep will be the sleep of death–The Loss of their Liberties. N.B. The printers at Baltimore announce, that within this some weeks past, they have not received a single paper through the post-office.3 The campaign coming on there soon, doubtless is the cause of this total stoppage.4"
Newspaper,No,Cursory Remarks,,The American Museum,,4/1/1788,"It is not my intention to enter largely into a consideration of this plan of government, but to suggest some ideas in addition to, and of the same nature with, those already made, showing the imperfections and the danger of it The first thing that strikes a diligent observer, is the want of precaution with regard to the sex of the president. Is it pro- vided that he shall be of the male gender? The Salii, a tribe of the Burgundians, in the nth century, excluded females from the sovereignty. Without a similar exclusion, what shall we think, if, in progress of time, we should come to have an old woman at the head of our affairs ? But what security have we that he shall be a white man? What would be the national disgrace if he should be elected from one of the southern states, and a vile negro should come to rule over us ? Treaties would then be formed with the tribes of Congo and Loango, instead of the civilized nations of Europe. But is there any security that he shall be 2. freeman? Who knows but the electors at a future period, in days of corruption, may pick up a man-servant, a convict perhaps, and give him the dominion ? Is any care taken that he shall be of perfect parts? Shall we, in affairs of a civil nature, leave a door open to lame men, bastards, eunuchs, and the devil knows what? A senate is the next great constituent part of the government ; and yet there is not a word said with regard to the ancestry of any of them ; whether they should be altogether Irish, or only Scots Irish. If any of them have been in the war of the White Boys, the Heart of Oak, or the like, they may overturn all authority, and make Shilelah the supreme law of the land. The house of representatives is to be so large, that it can never be built. They may begin it, but it can never be finished. Ten miles square! Babylon itself, unless the suburbs are taken into view, was not of greater extent. But what avails it to dwell on these things? The want of a bill of rights is the great evil. There was no occasion for a bill of wrongs; for there will be wrongs enough. But oh ! a bill of rights! What is the nature of a bill of rights?  It is a schedule or inventory of those powers which Congress do not possess. But if it is clearly ascertained what powers they have, what need of a catalogue of those powers they have not? Ah ! there is the mistake. A minister preaching, undertook, first, to show what was in his text; second, what was not in it. When it is specified what powers are given, why not also what powers are not given ? A bill of rights is wanting, and all those things which are usually secured under it — 1. The rights of conscience are swept away. The Confession of Faith, the Prayer-Book, the Manual and Pilgrim's Progress are to go. The psalms of Watts, I am told, are the only thing of the kind that is to have any quarter at all. 2. The liberty of the press — that is gone at the first stroke. Not so much as an advertisement for a stray horse, or a runaway negro, can be put in any of the gazettes. 3. The trial by jury — that is knocked in the head, and all that worthy class of men, the lawyers, who live by haranguing and bending the juries, are demolished. I would submit it to any candid man, if in this constitution there is the least provision for the privilege of shaving the beard? or is there any mode laid down to take the measure of a pair of breeches? Whence is it then, that men of learning seem so much to approve, while the ignorant are against it ? The cause is perfectly apparent, viz., that reason is an erring guide, while instinct, which is the governing principle of the untaught, is certain. Put a pig in a poke, carry it half a day's journey through woods and by-ways, let it out, and it will run home without deviation. Could Dr. Franklin do this? What reason have we then to suppose that his judgment, or that of Washington, could be equal to that of Mr. Smilie * in state affairs ? Were it not on this principle that we are able to account for it, it might be thought strange that old Livingston. of the Jersies, could be so hoodwinked as to give his sanction to such a diabolical scheme of tyranny amongst men — a constitution which may well be called hell-born. For if all the devils in Pandemonium had been employed about it, they could not have made a worse. Neil MacLaughlin, a neighbor of mine, who has been talking with Mr. Findley, says that under this constitution all weavers are to be put to death. What have these innocent manufacturers done that they should be proscribed ? Let other states think what they will of it, there is one reason why every Pennsylvanian should execrate this imposition upon mankind. It will make his state most probably the seat of government, and bring all the officers, and cause a great part of the revenue to be expended here. This must make the people rich, enable them to pay their debts, and corrupt their morals. Any citizen, therefore, on the Delaware and Susquehannah waters, ought to be hanged and quartered, that would give it countenance. I shall content myself at present with these strictures, but shall continue them from time to time as occasion may require."

DEDICATION Bible. 2 To his serenity the right respectable, most honourable highly renowned J[AME]S W[ILSO]N, political hackney writer to the most lucrative order of the bank, patronee of the most illusstrious Robertt Morris, and principal fabricator of the New Constitution. Sir, As your distinguished docility to the well-born, and the partial friendship of the great man, your patron, hath lugged you into all the honorary missions and dignified appointments of the nation, these several years past, and turned the eyes of all the full-blooded gentry in America towards you, as the only person fitted by nature to organize the government upon true despotic principles, I therefore beg leave to offer this small sacrifice to your vanity (an innate virtue of all our fraternity), upon the altar of adulation. It is true, the unwearied assiduity, and indefatigable zeal with which you served your friends, and pushed forward the rising grandeur of our party hath procured you the hatred of the people; but you know, Sir, to be hated by the vulgar is a compliment to your understanding, a mark of honour. Let me congratulate you, illustrious sir, on the nigh prospect of having all your numerous lucubrations, unremitted studies, and well concerted schemes happily realized beyond your most sanguine expectations, as an ample reward for all your services and sufferings, the time of your deliverance draweth nigh; the reparation of your shattered fortune, and your emancipation from a state of servile dependance upon bankers and brokers is just at hand; the adoption of the constitution is making rapid progress, and it is hoped will soon receive the finishing stroke, and then sir, you may take an everlasting farewell of poverty. The great influx of treasure from every comer of the land, into the ten miles square, will fill your coffers, and if possible, satiate the cravings of your pecuniary appetite. Now, as in times past, you have been a willing instrument, and ready minion to others; so then, in their tum, others will cringe at your nod, and bow at your image, will beg and pray to participate a share of the pensions, perquisites, sinecures and salaries, with all the tribe of lucrative offices, which will then be at your disposal. I would entreat you, dear sir, that when you arrive at the summit of your desires, you would deign to look back to your former condition, and make some provision for the relief of your insolvent brethen in time to come: that you would procure congress to constitute the ten miles square into a Sanctum-Sanctorum, a place of refuge for well born bankrupts, to shelter themselves and property from the rapacity of their persecuting creditors. You know, sir, in the capital of your native country, there is an asylum similar to this, of great utility to unfortunate debtors. As I have selected you from the whole group of illustrious names which embellished the new constitution, for the patron of my first essay, and have honoured you with this public dedication; it is to be hoped, when you come to your kingdom, you will remember these marks of respect-I remain, sir, with great solicitude for your elevation. Aristocrotis. THE GOVERNMENT OF NATURE DELINEATED, ETC. 3·16·3 The present is an active period; Europe is in a ferment breaking their constitutions, America is in a similar state, making a constitution-For this valuable purpose a convention was appointed, consisting of such as excelled in wisdom and knowledge, who met in Philadelphia last May. For my own part, 1 was so smitten with the character of the members, that 1 had assented to their production, while it was yet in embrio; and 1 make no doubt but every good republican did so too; but how great was my surprize, when it appeared with such a venerable train of names annexed to its tail, to find some of the people under different signatures; such as Centinel, Old Whig, Brutus, etc., daring to oppose it, and that too with barefaced arguments, obstinate reason and stubborn truth. This is certainly a piece of the most extravagant impudence to presume to contradict the collected wisdom of the United States; or to suppose a body, who engrossed the whole wisdom of the continent, was capable of erring. 1 expected the superior character of the convention would have secured it from profane sallies of a plebeian's pen; and its inherent infaliability, debarred the interference of impertinent reason or truth. It was too great an act of condescension to permit the people, by their state conventions, to assent and ratify, what the grand convention prescribed to them; but to enquire into its principles, or investigate its properties, was a presumption too daring to escape resentment. Such licentious conduct practised by the people, is a striking proof of our feeble governments, and calls aloud for the pruning knife, viz. the establishment of some proper plan of discipline. This the convention, in the depth of their united wisdom hath prescribed, which when established, will certainly put a stop to the growing evil. A consciousness of this, is, no doubt, the cause which stimulates the people to oppose it with so much vehemence; they deprecate the idea of being confined within their proper sphere; they cannot endure the thoughts of being obliged to mind their own business, and leave the affairs of government to those whom nature hath destined to rule. 1 say nature, for it is a fundamental principle, as clear as an axiom, that nature hath placed proper degrees and subordinations amongst mankind, and ordained a few* to rule, and many to obey.-I am not obliged to prove this principal; because it would be madness in the extreme to attempt to prove a self-evident truth; but with all due submission to the infaliable wisdom of the grand convention, let me presume to examine whether they have not, in the new plan of government, inviolably adhered to this supreme principle.-The exhorbitant power, which the people of this country possess, of electing their rulers, is directly repugnant to this superlative principle of nature, and tends to the subversion of all order and good government; for they may and often do advance those men to be rulers, whom nature had ordained for subjects, and to neglect the natural rulers. This is a gross inversion of the law of nature, and ought to be cashiered; but the vulgar opinion is so strong in favour of this unnatural practice, that it would be dangerous to divest them of it all at once. It might enflame their turbulent minds, and excite them to commit some outrageous action, in support of what they have been taught to consider as their natural, inherent, and unalienable rights. -The venerable convention foresaw this, and accomodated their plan to humour these mistaken notions of the people, so far as was consistent with the honour, dignity and rights of the more illustrious descended, whose title to rule is founded on the law of nature. In article first, section first, of the new plan, it is declared, that all legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a congress of the united states; which shall consist of a senate-very right, quite agreeable to nature; and house of representatives-not quite so right-This is a palpable compliance with the humours and corrupt practices of the times-but what follows in section 2d is still worse: the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year, by the people of the several states: this is a most dangerous power, and must soon produce fatal and pernicious consequences, were it not circumscribed and poised by proper checks and ballances: but in this is displayed the unparalleled sagacity of the august convention; that when such bulwarks of prejudice surrounded the evil, so as to render it both difficult and dangerous to attack it by assault and storm, they have invested and barricaded it so closely as will certainly deprive it of its baneful influence and prevent its usual incroachments;-they have likewise stationed their miners and sapers so judiciously, that they will certainly, in process of time, intirely reduce and demolish this obnoxious practice of popular election. There is a small thrust given to it in the body of the conveyance itself. The term of holding elections, is every two years; this is much better than the detestable mode of annual elections, so fatal to energy; however, if nothing more than this were done, it would still remain an insupportable inconvenience; but in section the 4th it is provided, that congress by law may alter and make such regulations with respect to the times, places, and manner of holding elections, as to them seemeth fit and proper: this is certainly a very salutory provision, most excellently adapted to counter-ballance the great, and apparently dangerous concessions made to the plebians in the first and second sections, with such a prudent restriction as this they are quite harmless: no evil can arise from them, if congress have only the sagacity and fortitude, to avail themselves of the power they possess by this section: for when the stated term (for which the primary members was elected) is nigh expired, congress may appoint next election to be held in one place in each state; and so as not to give the rabble needless disgust, they may appoint the most central place for that purpose. They can never be at a loss for an ostensible reason, to vary and shift from place to place until they may fix it at any extremity of the state it suits. This will be the business of the senate, to observe the particular places in each state, where their influence is most extensive, and where the inhabitants are most obsequious to the will of their superiors; and there appoint the elections to be held. By this means, such members will be returned, to the house of representatives (as it is called) as the president and senate shall be pleased to recommend, and they, no doubt, will recommend such gentlemen only as are distinguished by some peculiar federal feature; so that unanimity and concord will shine conspicuous through every branch of government. This section is ingeniously calculated, and must have been intended by the convention to exterminate electioneering entirely; for by putting the time of election in the hands of congress, they have thereby given them a power to perpetuate themselves when they shall find it safe and convenient to make the experiment. For though a preceding clause says, that representatives shall be chosen for two years, and senators for six years; yet this clause being subsequent annuls the former, and puts it in the power of congress, (when some favourable juncture intervenes) to alter the time to four and twelve years. This cannot be deemed an unconstitutional stretch of power. for the constitution in express terms, puts the time of holding elections in their power, and certainly they are the proper judges when to exert that power: thus by doubling the period from time to time, its extent will soon be rendered coeval with the life of man; and it is but a very short and easy transition from this to hereditary succession, which is most agreeable to the institutions of nature, who in all her works. hath ordained the descendant of every species of beings to succeed its immediate progenitor. in the same actions, ends and order. 3·16·5 The indefatigable labourious ass, never aspires to the honours, or assumes the employment of the sprightly warlike steed. nor does he ever pretend that it is his right to succeed him in all his offices, and dignities. because he bears some resemblance to the defunct in his figure and nature. The lamma, though useful enough for the purposes for which he was intended by nature. is every way incompetent to perform the offices of the lephant; nor does he ever pretend to usurp his elevated station. Every species of beings, animate and inanimate, seem fully satisfied with the station assigned them by nature; but perverse, obstinate man, he alone spurns at her institutions, and inverts her order,* he alone repines at his situation. and endeavours to usurp the station of his superiors. But this digression has led me from the subject in hand. I was treating of the powers congress possesses over elections. I have already discussed this point so far as the times and places are concerned. The next object that presents itself is the power which the new constitution gives to congress to regulate the manner of elections. The common practice of voting at present is by ballot; by this mode it is impossible for a gentleman to know how he is served by his dependant, who may be possessed of a vote; therefore this mode must be speedily altered for that of viva voce, which will secure to a rich man all the votes of his numerous dependants and friends and their dependants. By this means he may command any office in the gift of the people, which he pleases to set up for. This will answer a good end while electioneering exists; and will likewise contribute something towards its destruction. A government founded agreeable to nature must be intirely independant; that is. it must be beyond the reach of annoyance or controul from every power on earth. Now in order to render it thus, several things are necessary. r st. The means of their own support must be within the immediate reach of rulers: for this purpose they must possess the sole power of taxation. As this is a principal article, it ought, in all things to have pre-eminence; and therfore the convention has placed it in front. The congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes [,] duties, imposts and excises, so that they shall never be at a loss for money while there is a shilling on the continent, for their power to procure it is as extensive as their desires; and so it ought, because they can never desire any thing but is good and salutary; for there is no doubt but the convention will transfer their infallability to the new congress, and so secure them from doing evil. This power of taxation will answer many valuable purposes, besides the support of government. In the first place, in the course of its operation, it will annihilate the relicks of the several state legislations; for every tax which they may lay, will be deemed by congress an infringement upon the federal constitution, which constitution and the laws of congress being paramount to all other authority, will of consequence nullify every inferior law, which the several states may think proper to enact, particularly such as relate to taxes; so that they being deprived of the means of existence, their pretended sovereignties will gradually linger away. 2dly. It will create and diffuse a spirit of industry among the people; they will then be obliged to labour for money to pay their taxes: there will be no trifling from time to time. as is done now; the new government will have energy sufficient to compel immediate payment. 3 3dly. This will make the people attend to their own business; and not be dabbling in politics-things they are entirely ignorant of; nor is it proper they should understand. But it is very probable that the exercise of this power may be opposed by the refractory plebians. who (such is the perverseness of their natures) often refuse to comply with what is manifestly for their advantage; but to prevent all inconveniency from this quarter the congress have power to raise and support armies. This is the second thing necessary to render government independent. The creatures who compose these armies. are a species of animals. wholly at the disposal of government; what others call their natural rights they resign into the hands of their superiors, even the right of self-preservation (so precious to all other beings) they entirely surrender. and put their very lives in the power of their masters: so that they having no rights of their own to care for. they become naturally jealous and envious of those possessed by others, they are therefore proper instruments in the hands of government, to divest the people of their usurped rights. But the capital business of these armies will be. to assist the collectors of taxes. imposts. and excise. in raising the revenue; and this they will perform with the greatest alacrity as it is by this they are supported; but for this they would be in a great measure useless; and without this they could not exist. 4thly.4 To render government entirely independent. they must have the sole and absolute command of the militia without restriction or reserve. either as to time or place. principle or conscience; and with this power the constitution hath amply furnished them-see article 1st sect. 8. the congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections. and repel invasions. to provide for organising, arming. and disciplining the militia. and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states. By this clause the militia is divided into two classes. viz. active and inactive; the active militia will be those employed in the service of the united states. or in other words in the service of congress; they will consist of young men chiefly. who will not be attached to any particular place, on account of their families: or such eccentric genius's as by their superior address or daring spirit may gain an ascendency over the minds of the vulgar, and so become the heads of liberty factions. Such persons as these will best suit the purpose of government; and if they are judiciously culled and picked. will compose a very respectable army; from which many great advantages may result to government. 1st. They will assist. in conjunction with the standing army, to quell insurrections that may arise in any part of the empire on account of pretensions to support liberty. redress grievances. and the like. 2dly. This power will enable congress to fulfill their engagements with foreign nations, their allies; should they stipulate in the treaty of alliance, to furnish a number of troops (in consideration of a certain sum of money) to be employed in the service of these allies, when they are engaged in war, the active militia will always be ready. Such treaties as these will likewise grow into a lucrative branch of commerce: the Swiss Cantons find their accounts in a traffic somewhat similar, and the prince of Hesse Cassel, and other German princes who are excellent financiers. raise a great part of their revenues by such dealings. Now. the very letter of the above quoted sections gives congress such a power as this; and in article 6th it is declared, That all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the united states; viz. by the president and two-thirds of the senators, [see art. 2d. sec. 2dj5 shall be the supreme law of the land. Another clause says, that congress is to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the land; therefore the militia, by virtue of these powers given to congress may be transported to Europe, Africa or Asia, to execute the treaties of congress, because they are the supreme laws of the land. Although there is nothing in this constitution, but what bears an exact resemblance to nature, yet there is no feature or lineament in the whole portrait pleases me equal to this. It is nature itself in minature. With what heavenly ideas must the framers of these articles have been inspired; how artfully and ingeniously they have conveyed to congress the absolute disposal of their subjects. It is true they have reserved to the several states the business of training the militia, according to the discipline prescribed by congress. By this reservation, the states are constituted drill-sergeants and fuglemen to train up soldiers for the general government; an employment too mean and servile for the dignified congress; but every way suitable to the quality of the discarded states, or deposed sovereigns. The second class or inactive militia, comprehends all the rest of the peasants; viz. the farmers, mechanics, labourers. etc. which good policy will prompt government to disarm. It would be dangerous to trust such a rabble as this with arms in their hands. They might employ them in opposing the supreme laws of the land instead of employing them to execute them. 4thly To render government independent, the people must be divested of all the privileges they have wrested from their rulers in times of anarchy and confusion. In modem times the people for the most part have these privileges arranged together in one instrument, which commonly serves as a preliminary to their constitution-this instrument, they call their bill of rights. These rights are claims which the people have extorted from weak, timid, irresolute rulers-However the grand convention in framing the new constitution, hath omitted the dangerous ceremony, and left it in the power of congress, to irradicate every vestage of so daring an encroachment. One particular article provided for in these bills of rights, is the liberty of the press. which the people pretend ought never to be restrained. altho' it is undeniable that it has ever been the vehicle of slander. and the source of innumerable evils; it hath filled the world with seditions, insurrections, rebellions. con~piracies, murders, heresies, and the most dangerous innovations of every sort; wherever it is tolerated it is impossible to divest the people of those dangerous privileges, which they have usurped in time of turbulence and disorder; through this channel they will receive early intelligence of the schemes of government. and be ready on the slightest offence, to unite in support of what they deem their natural and unalienable rights; so that it might prove difficult for the best appointed army, that congress could possibly raise or support, to repel their fury. or reduce them to obedience; but as there is no provision made for its security in the new frame of government, congress may abolish it at pleasure. which they will soon find it their interest to do. and its own native licentiousness will furnish them with reasons plausible enough to form a preamble for the act; as none but friends of government will then have an opportunity of communicating their sentiments to the public. or displaying their genius: so none but they will care to acquire sentiments, or cultivate genius. Learning will then flourish in its native soil, and science run in its proper channel; for a knowledge of letters among the vulgar is the bane of good government. Another privilege which the people possesses at present. and which the new congress will find it their interest to deprive them of. is trial by jury-for of all the powers which the people have wrested from government. this is the most absurd; it is even a gross violation of common sense. and most destructive to energy. In the first place it is absurd. that twelve ignorant plebians, should be constituted judges of a law. which passed through so many learned hands;-first a learned legislature after many learned animadversions and criticisms have enacted it-Second. learned writers have explained and commented on it.- Third. learned lawyers twisted. turned and new modeled it-and lastly. a learned judge opened up and explained it. Yet after all these learned discussions, an illiterate jury (who have scarce a right to think for themselves instead of judging for others) must determine whether it applies to the fact or not; and by their verdict the learned judge must be governed in 3. 16 . 1 3 passing sentence; and perhaps a learned gentleman be cast in an action with an insignificant cottager. Secondly. Common sense recoils at the very idea of such a pernicious practice as this. because it makes no difference between the virtuous and the vicious. the precious and the vile; between those of noble birth. and illustrious descent. and those of base blood. and ignoble obscure pedigree-for an ignorant stupid jury, cannot discern the merit of persons-it is the merits of the cause they examine; which is just reversing the question, and beginning at the wrong end. Thirdly. This custom is fatal to energy, for tho' a law should be expressed in the most pointed terms, a jury may soften and mitigate, and in a great measure destroy the spirit of it. The lawyers also suffers by this practice; because, there being no appeal from the verdict of the jury with respect to the fact-the action therefore, often ends in the same court in which it originated, but where no jury interferes an appeal lies to a higher court, where higher fees must be given to lawyers, and greater numbers of them employed; and so much better chance for them to amass fortunes. [It appears as if some discerning lawyer indicted that nice clause in the constitution, which gives to the continental supreme court an appelate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact; it seems so happily calculated to their advantage· There are many other rights claimed by the people besides these mentioned; but as they are of little consequence, I shall leave the discussion of them to the new congress themselves, who no doubt will be quick sighted enough to discern them, and prudent enough to provide for their removal. But before I conclude, I must take notice of an incumbrance upon government, which have been more general in its operation than any yet mentioned; viz. religion. There has been but few nations in the world, where the people possessed the privilege of electing their rulers; of prefixing a bill of rights to their constitutions, enjoyed a free press, or trial by jury; but there was never a nation in the world whose government was not circumscribed by religion. It intermingled itself so much with the Jewish system, that it is difficult to distinguish between some of the functions of the magistrates and those of the priests. In some stages of their commonwealth, the high priest was also the supreme civil magistrate. Religion had also a decisive influence in the Grecian and Roman systems of jurisprudence; their augurs could in many cases put a negative on the decrees of their senates; and countermand the orders of their consuls and dictators.-In our own times, the most absolute rulers in the world, find their power abridged by religion. The grand signior possesses an authority very similar to the principle of nature which I have stated; yet his power is limitted by religion;-for wherever it interposes, the will of the sovereign must submit to its decrees: When the koran hath prescribed any religious rite; hath enjoined any moral duty; or hath confirmed by its sanction any political maxim. The command of the sultan cannot overturn that which an higher authority hath established. Even the Venetian government, which of all other seems to be formed on the best model, (though much inferior to our new plan) is nevertheless embarrassed with religion; but what need I mention particulars, since every government in the world, as I observed before, has, in a lesser or greater degree felt this inconvenience. Indeed it seems to have formed an essential part of them; such a part as could not be expunged without annihilating the whole systems; and though this might have been done, yet the shallow brains of those antiquated legislators, could not devise a possibility of avoiding the same radical evil in any new system they could frame; so that this direful incumbrance has hitherto proved too powerful for the united efforts of all the legislators and philosophers that ever appeared in the world to conquer. But what is the world to the federal convention! but as the drop of a bucket, or the small dust in the balance! What the world could not accomplish from the commencement of time till now, they easily performed in a few moments, by declaring, that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust; under the united states. This is laying the ax to the root of the tree; whereas other nations only lopped off a few noxious branches. This is purifying the fountain; the streams must of course be pure. By this provision the convention hath prudently removed the distemper from the head, and secured it from contamination.- The certain method to preserve the members from catching the infection. Religion, is certainly attended with dangerous consequences to government: it hath been the cause of millions being slaughtered, whose lives and services might have been of use to their masters; but in a peculiar manner the christian religion, which has these several centuries past prevailed over a great part of Europe, and is professed by a great many of the vulgar in this country, is of all others the most unfavourable to a government founded upon nature; because it pretends to be of a supernatural divine origin, and therefore sets itself above nature. Its precepts are likewise so rigid and severe, as to render it impossible for any gentleman of fashion or good breeding to comply with them in any sense, without a manifest violation of decorum, and an abandonment of every genteel amusement and fashionable accomplishment; but another capital objection against this singular system of religion is, that it prohibits slavery, which is so essential to government, that it cannot exist, with any degree of energy, without it, for all the subjects of a good government ought to be slaves in a political sense; or as they were anciently termed, vassals; that is, their persons and property must be entirely at the will and disposal of their 3·16.15 masters; which is ingeniously provided for in the new constitution, under the articles of taxation and discipline of the militia. The congress must certainly extirpate from their dominions such a religion as this that is an enemy to so many good things. By this means the clergy may be annihilated,* who have always been an ambitious, aspiring and restless set of men, ever grasping at honours and distinctions, which is the unalienable prerogative of those of illustrious descent: they also by their address and cunning, gain an ascendency, and assume an authority over the people, which is only proper for the rulers to possess; but perhaps it may be urged that some sort of religion is necessary to awe the minds of the vulgar, and keep them in subjection to government. I grant, weak, feeble governments, such as our present systems, may stand in need of the visionary terrors of religion for their support; but such an energetic government as the new constitution, disdains such contemptible auxiliaries as the belief of a Deity, the immortality of the soul, or the resurrection of the body, a day of judgment, or a future state of rewards and punishments. 9 Such bug-bears as these are too distant and illusory to claim the notice of the new congress. The present state of punishments, which will be within their immediate reach to inflict, will answer the end infinitely better. But if some religion must be had, the religion of nature will certainly be preferred by a government founded upon the law of nature. -One great argument in favour of this religion is, that most of the members of the grand convention are great admirers of it; and they certainly are the best models to form our religious, as well as our civil belief on. This religion also admits of proper degrees and distinctions amongst mankind; but the other does not; for it commands to call no man upon earth master or lord. From these remarks, I think it evident, that the grand convention hath dexterously provided for the removal of every thing that hath ever operated as a restraint upon government in any place or age of the world. But perhaps some weak heads may think that the constitution itself will be a check upon the new congress; but this I deny, for the convention has so happily worded themselves, that every part of this constitution, either bears double meaning, or no meaning at all; and if any concessions are made to the people in one place, it is effectually cancelled in another; so that in fact this constitution is much better and gives more scope to the rulers than they durst safely take if there was no constitution at all; for then the people might contend that the power was inherent in them, and that they had made some implied reserves in the original grant; but now they cannot, for every thing is expressly given away to government in this plan. Perhaps some people may think that power, which the house of representatives possesses, of impeaching the officers of government will be a restraint upon them; but this entirely vanishes, when it is considered that the senate hath the principal say in appointing these officers, and that they are the sole judges of all impeachments. Now it would be absurd to suppose that they would remove their own servants for performing their secret orders perhaps. For the interest of rulers and the ruled will then be two distinct things. The mode of electing the president is another excellent regulation, most wisely calculated to render him the obsequious machine of congress. He is to be chosen by electors appointed in such manner as the state legislators shall direct: but then the highest in votes cannot be president, without he has the majority of all the electors; and if none have this majority, then the congress is to chuse president out of the five highest on the return. By this means the congress will always have the making of the president after the first election; so that if the reigning president pleases his masters, he need be under no apprehensions of being turned out for any severities used to the people, for though the congress may not have influence enough to procure him the majority of the votes of the electoral college, yet they will always be able to prevent any other from having such a majority, and to have him returned among the five highest, so that they may 3·[6.16 have the appointing of him themselves. All these wise regulations, proves to a demonstration, that the grand convention was infaliable. The congress having thus disentangled themselves from all popular checks and choices; and being supported by a well disciplined army and active militia, will certainly command dread and respect abroad, obedience and submission at home; they will then look down with awful dignity and tremendous majesty from the pinnacle of glory, to which fortune has raised them upon the insignificant creatures, their subjects, whom they have reduced to that state of vassalage and servile submission, for which they were primarily destined by nature. America will then be great amongst the nations and princess amongst the provinces: her fleets will cover the deserts of the ocean and convert it into a popular city; and her invincible armies overturn the thrones of princes. The glory of Britain shall fall like lightning before puissant America; when she arises to shake the nations, and take vengeance on all who dare oppose her. O! thou most venerable and august congress! with what astonishing ideas my mind is ravished! when I contemplate thy rising grandeur, and anticipate thy future glory! Happy thy servants! happy thy vassals! and happy thy slaves, which sit under the shade of thy omnipotent authority, and behold the glory of thy majesty! for such a state who would not part with ideal blessings of liberty? who would not chearfully resign the nominal advantages of freedom? the dazzling splendour of Assyrian, Persian, Macedonian and Roman greatness will then be totally eclipsed by the radient blaze of this glorious western luminary! These beautiful expressions, aristocracy, oligarchy, upon which the popular odium hath fixed derision and contempt, will then resume their natural emphasis; their genuine significance will be perfectly understood, and no more perverted or abused. I shall now suggest a few directions to my worthy friends, the inventors and advocates of this admirable constitution-1st. that the people may be brought speedily to assent and ratify this constitution, they must have very short time given them for consideration; it may take well enough with them while they know it only by report, but if time and leasure is allowed them to examine it, they will surely reject it. 2dly. everything like argument in its defence must be carefully avoided, and instead thereof, the profound wisdom of the convention, the great men of which it was composed, particularly the names of a Washington and a Franklin, must be rung in the people's ears: it must be declared a crime bordering on blasphemy, to say any thing against the production of such men as these, and if any thing is wrote concerning it, it must be panegyrick, eulogium, or rhapsody; but by all means avoid reasoning, or you will betray the good cause in which you are engaged. 3rdly. All who presume to speak or write against this constitution, must be branded as enemies to their country and to the union of the states; to impress this upon the minds of the vulgar, they must be termed antifederalists,  all their personal faults must be searched out and exposed; and the people must be warned not to listen to their reasoning on the subject, as they are interested persons, being either officers of government, or expectants of offices, and that their opposition arises from sinister views, and selfish motives, and not from a conviction of its evil: but beware of encountering their arguments, or you will certainly expose this darling constitution to popular execration. 4thly. The people must be told, that the revenue of the nation will be chiefly raised by impost under the new constitution, and that internal taxation will seldom if ever be recurred to; this will amuse them in the mean time while they possess the power, but we hope congress will have more wisdom than to verify this prophecy, as it would be very injurious to the interest of our well beloved brother Robert Morris, and all our brethren in high life throughout the nation: a land, but in particular a high poll-tax, will be the most effectual method of collecting the finances; some other articles, such as stamp duties; a tax on candles, leather, soap, etc. may tum to a very good account; and the money raised from the sale of the active militia to foreigners, will be no contemptable source of revenue. 5thly. All communication between the people of the different states must as much as possible be prevented-therefore our own friends must be posts and postmasters, and they must have full power to break open all packets, letters, and papers of every sort, and if they contain any thing against the new constitution they must be suppressed, if not closed up again and sent to the persons to whom they are directed; and it is requested of all our trusty friends throughout the country, that they intercept all papers, which come in their way; examine their contents, and if possible destroy them, if they contain any thing against this glorious plan. 6thly. II The militia must be disarmed; for this purpose all the public arms must be called in, upon pretence of having them cleaned; this will not only deprive our enemies of using them against us, but they will be ready to put in the hands of our friends, or men raised by them for the establishment of the constitution if coercion is necessary. 7thly. The distress of the people must be magnified as much as possible; they must be told that they are ruined and miserable, that they are all bankrupts; and that all these calamities is occasioned by their feeble governments (although in fact it is by their own extravagance); and that the new plan will effectually relieve all their wants, and redress all their grievances; although in reality it must be their own industry and economy; but this they must not know for the present. 8thly. They must be told that the new congress will immediately payoff all the debts of the union; but if they ask you how? you must evade the question the best way you can; for if you tell them the truth, that it will be by levying high taxes on themselves, they will be sure to spurn your argument and constitution too. 9thly. The highly and elevated station, to which this will raise America amongst the nations, must be held forth with great vehemence. The people are mighty fond of pomp and splendor, and will almost grant anything to raise their country to grandeur and magnificence. . They must be told that anarchy will inevitably be the consequence, if they reject the proposed plan; for there are no more wise men on the continent capable to frame another system; and the same men which composed the late grand convention will not meet a second time. Finally, these directions, if strictly observed, may be of great utility; but they are not to be implicitly confided in. Standing armies are the most proper instruments, both for maintaining arid establishing a good government; therefore to secure all beyond a doubt, a standing army must be speedily provided; for this purpose application must be made to our good ally, the French king, to furnish us with a number of troops; and so as not to alarm the people too soon, they may be landed with a pretence to invade Canada. His majesty must also be instructed to demand troops of congress, to assist in this expedition, according to the treaty of alliance. Ten or twenty thousand could be raised in a thrice; and I am confident our friend Robert, and all our other monied friends, bankers and brokers. will supply the necessary demands of money. they may easily be got ready to take the field against next summer, or fall. It could be no loss if they were not needed. they would be so many ready made soldiers for the new congress. who would. no doubt. purchase them at a high price, and the French troops might return in peace to their own country. APPENDIX Since writing the foregoing strictures. I have seen Martin's information to the house of delegates of the state of Maryland This arch enemy has let out secrets that certainly never was intended to be discovered; he hath with uncommon audacity. deserted the great convention. and exposed its intestines to public view; yet I cannot think he has destroyed its infaliability; all he has told. only proves that the majority were no patriots, nor lovers of their country; and what of all that; we can prove they were lovers of themselves; and that self-love is the noblest passion of the soul, and the best motive that human actions can spring from. Now if the grand convention acted uniformly from the best motive. self-love. were stimulated by the noblest desires. self-agrandisement. and influenced by the choicest principles, self-preservation, there can be no doubt of their infaliability. This truth being established. it necessarily follows. that it is gross prophanity and unpardonable crime for faliable creatures to presume to scrutinize their work. or arraign their production, before the bar of their corrupt depraved reason. The centinel in his 16th number,13 has also discovered a secret of some importance; viz. that the expost facto clause, in connection with several others. screens, what he calls public defaulters, from being obliged to refund the millions they owe the public, and secure the delinquent states from being called upon for their arrears due to the continental treasury! How this fiend discovered the intention of this important clause I cannot divine. It was veiled over so nicely with a semblance of liberty, that I expected it would ride its quarantine without being observed: but nothing can escape the penetrating eye of this wicked centinel. I wish some means were devised to silence him.-Money, and the promise of lucrative offices has a fascinating influence; and has hitherto been of great service to our cause; many have been bought off whose opposition would certainly have 3. 16 . 1 9 injured us. I wish every stratagem were tried of this nature to allure the centinel to join us, or at least to be silent: he has done great mischief, and is still doing more; and he seems to possess such a determined spirit as not to be intimidated by threats. The people seem very much alarmed at the tendency of the expost facto clause. Several of the Philadelphia papers teem with pieces exposing the principal public defaulters; but I hope the present Congress will not be induced by this to commit such a piece of cruelty, as to call them to account, and oblige them to refund the sums they owe. If, they postpone it till the new government is established, they can then settle them decently without any injury to themselves: nor can the public complain of fraud or injustice done them, since they have tacitly given their consent to it, by ratifying the new constitution. The provision made in the constitution for cancelling the public debts, was certainly dictated by the first principle of nature, viz. self preservation; the most influential members in the convention being public defaulters, were impelled to take this step for their own security; and who in their senses can blame them for providing for their own safety. when it was in their power. I am happy to find that the system of intrigue and chicane on which our whole scheme was founded, is still carried on with success all over the continent. The directions I have suggested has been anticipated I find by our friends; by this means six conventions have been lugged in to adopt the plan;-although I don't like the idea of amendments which Massachusetts has introduced; it may be attended with bad consequences; other states may follow the example, and so spoil the whole plot; that such a fatal catastrophe may be prevented, we ought to employ our whole skill, and bend our whole manoeuvres. The adjournment of New Hampshire Convention, is very alarming; yet I hope that state may be brought to reason: a few donations might answer a good end. I long for the asset of nine states; we could then settle all disputes by applying the ultimo ratio regum, as General Washington expresses it,14 this is the most effectual mode of reasoning; may we speedily have it in our power. Finis."
Newspaper,No,Centinel,,Independent Gazetteer,,4/9/1788,"To the PEOPLE of PENNSYLVANIA. Fellow-Citizens, The measures that are pursuing to effect the establishment of the new constitution, are so repugnant to truth, honor, and the well-being of society, as would disgrace any cause. If the nature and tendency of this system were to be judged of by the conduct of its framers and patrons, what a picture of ambition and villainy would present itself to our view! From the specimens they have already given, anticipation may easily realise the consequences that would flow from the new constitution, if established; may bid adieu to all the blessings of liberty, to all the fruits of the late glorious assertion of the rights of human nature, made at the expence of so much blood and treasure. Yet such is the infatuation of many well meaning persons, that they view with indifference the attrocious villainy which characterises the proceedings of the advocates of the new system: The daring, and in most parts of the United States, the successful methods practised to shackle the press, and destroy the freedom of discussion; the silencing the Pennsylvania Herald, to prevent the publication of the invaluable debates of the late convention of this state the total suppression of real intelligence, and of the illuminations of patriotism through the medium of the post-office; the systematic fraud and deception that pervade the union; the stigmatising, and by every art which ambition and malice can suggest, labouring to villify, intimidate and trample under foot every disinterested patriot, who preferring his country�s good to every other consideration, has the courage to stand forth the champion of liberty and the people; and the intercepting of private confidential letters passing from man to man, violating the sacredness of a seal, and thus infringing one of the first privileges of freemen�that of communicating with each other: I say all these are overlooked by the infatuated admirers of the new system, who, deluded by the phantom of wealth and prosperity, profit not by the admonitory lesson which such proceedings afford, are deaf to the calls of patriotism, and would rush blindly into the noose of ambition. However, to the honor of Pennsylvania, a very large majority of her citizens view the subject in its true light, and spurn the shackles pre-pared for them. They will in due time convince the aspiring despots and avaricious office-hunters, that their dark intrigues, and deep concerted schemes of power and aggrandisement, are ineffectual, that they are neither to be duped nor dragooned out of their liberties. The conspirators, I know, insolently boast that their strength in the other states will enable them to crush the opposition in this; but let them not build upon that which is in its nature precarious and transient, which must fail them the moment the delusion is dispelled: Their success in the other states is the fruit of deceptions that cannot be long supported. Indeed the audacity and villainy of the conspirators on the one hand, and the frantic enthusiasm, and easy credulity of the people on the other, in some of the states, however well attested and recorded in the faithful page of history, will be treated by posterity as fabulous. The great artifice that is played off on this occasion, is the persuading the people of one place, that the people every where else are nearly unanimous in favor of the new system, and thus endeavouring by the fa[s]cination of example and force of general opinion to prevail upon the people every where to acquiesce in what is represented to them as the general sentiment. Thus as one means of deception has failed them, they have adopted another, always avoiding rational discussion. When the glare of great names, the dread of annihilation if the new system was rejected, or the adoption of it even delayed, were dissipated by the artillery of truth and reason; they have recurred to the one now practising, the intimidating and imposing influence of imaginary numbers and una�nimity that are continually reverberated from every part of the union, by the tools and vehicles of the would-be despots; and in which they have had astonishing success. The people in the Eastern states have been taught to believe that it is all harmony to the Southward; and in the Southern states they are discouraged from opposition by the unanimity of the Eastern and Northern states; nay, what will appear incredible, considering the distance, a gentleman of veracity just returned from New-York, assures that the conspirators have had the address to inculcate an opinion there that all opposition had ceased in this state, notwithstanding the evidence of the contrary is so glaring here; this gentleman further informs, that so entirely devoted is the post-office, that not a single newspaper is received by the printers of that place from this city or elsewhere; and a Boston newspaper come by private hand, announces [to] the public, that for some months past, the printers there have received no newspapers to the Southward of New-Haven, in Connecticut, where the press is muzzled, and consequently, cannot injure the cause; that all intelligence of the occurrences in the other states is withheld from them; and that they know more of the state of Europe, than of their own country. Notwithstanding many thousand copies of the Reasons of Dissent of the minority of the late convention of this state were printed and forwarded in every direction, and by various conveyances, scarcely any of these got beyond the limits of this state, and most of them not until a long time after their publication. The printer of these Reasons, by particular desire, addressed a copy of them to every printer in the union, which he sent to the Post-office to be conveyed in the mail as usual, long before the new arrangement, as it is called, took place; and yet we since find that none of them reached the place of their destination. This is a full demonstration of the subserviency of the Post Office, and a striking evidence of the vigilance that has been exerted to suppress information. It is greatly to be regretted that the opposition in Massachusetts were denied the benefits of our discussion, that the unanswerable dissent of our minority did not reach Boston in time to influence the decision of the great question by their convention, as it would in all probability have enabled patriotism to triumph; not that I would derogate from the good sense and public spirit of that state, which I have no doubt would in common circumstances have shone with equal splendor, but this was far from being the case; the new constitution was viewed in Massachusetts through the medium of a SHAYS, the terrors of HIS insurrection had not subsided; a government that would have been execrated at another time was embraced by many as a refuge from anarchy, and thus liberty deformed by mad riot and dissention, lost her ablest advocates. As the liberties of all the states in the union are struck at in common with those of Pennsylvania, by the conduct of the Post-Master General and deputies, I trust that the example which her Legislatur& has set by instructing her delegates in Congress on this subject,� will be followed by the others, that with one accord they will hurl their vengeance on the venal instruments of ambition, who have presumed to prostrate one of the principal bulwarks of liberty. In a confederated government of such extent as the United States, the freest communication of sentiment and information should be maintained, as the liberties, happiness and welfare of the union depend upon a concert of counsels; the signals of alarm whenever ambition should rear its baneful head, ought to be uniform: without this communication between the members of the confederacy the freedom of the press, if it could be maintained in so severed a situation, would cease to be a security against the encroachments of tyranny. The truth of the foregoing position is strikingly illustrated on the present occasion; for want of this inter-community of sentiment and information, the liberties of this country are brought to an awful crisis; ambition has made a great stride towards dominion; has succeeded thro� the medium of muzzled presses to delude a great body of the people in the other states, and threatens to overwhelm the enlightened opposition in this by external force. Here, indeed, notwithstanding every nerve was strained, by the conspirators, to muzzle or demolish every newspaper that allowed free discussion, two printers have asserted the independency of the press, whereby the arts of ambition have been detected, and the new system has been pourtrayed in its native villainy; its advocates have long since abandoned the field of argument, relinquished the unequal contest, and truth and patriotism reigns triumphant in this state; but the conspirators trust to their success in the other states for the attainment of their darling object, and therefore all their vigilance is exerted to prevent the infectious spirit of freedom and enlightened patriotism communicating to the rest of the union�all intercourse is as far as possible cut off. To rectify the erroneous representation made in the other states of the sentiments of the people in this respecting the new constitution, I think it my duty to state the fact as it really is:�Those who favor this system of tyranny are most numerous in the city of Philadelphia, where, perhaps, they may be a considerable majority; in the most eastern counties they compose about one-fourth of the people, but in the middle, northern and western counties not above a twentieth part; so that upon the whole the friends to the new constitution in this state are about one-sixth of the people. The following circumstance is an evidence of the spirit and decision of the opposition:�An individual unadvisedly and without conceit, and contrary to the system of conduct generally agreed upon, went to the expence of printing and circulating an address to the Legislature, reprobating in the strongest terms the new constitution, and praying that the deputies of this state in the federal Convention, who in violation of their duty acceeded to the new constitution, be called to account for their daring procedure; this address or petition was signed by upwards of four thousand citizens in only two counties, viz. Franklin and Cumberland, and if the time had admitted, prior to the adjournment of the Legislature, there is reason to believe that this high-toned application would have been subscribed by five-sixth of the freemen of this state. The advocates of the new constitution, availing themselves of this partial measure of two counties, have asserted it to be the result of a general exertion, which is so evidently false that it can only deceive people at a distance from us, for the counties over the mountain are nearly unanimous in the opposition; in Fayette at a numerous county meeting, there appeared to be but two persons in favor of the constitution; in Bedford county in the mountains, there are not above twenty; in Huntingdon adjoining, about 30; in Dauphin, in the middle country, not 100; in Berks, a large eastern county that has near 5000 taxable inhabitants, not more than 50, and so of several others, and yet no petitions were circulated or signed in those counties.�The system of conduct alluded to is the forming societies in every county in the state, who have committees of correspondence; these are now engaged in planning a uniform exertion to emancipate this state from the thraldom of despotism; a convention of deputies from every district will in all probability be agreed upon, as the most eligible mode of combining the strength of the opposition, which is increasing daily both in numbers and spirit.10 The Centinel, supported by the dignity of the cause he advocates, and sensible that his well-meant endeavors have met the approbation of the community, views with ineffable contempt the impotent efforts of disappointed ambition to depreciate his merit and stigmatize his performances, and without pretending to the spirit of divination, he thinks he may predict that the period is not far distant when the authors and willful abettors of the new constitution will be viewed with detestation by every good man, whilst the Centinels of the present day will be honored with the esteem and confidence of a grateful people. Great pains have been taken to discover the author of these papers, with a view, no doubt, to villify his private character, and thereby lessen the usefulness of his writings, and many suppose they have made the discovery, but in this they are mistaken. The Centinel submits his performance to the public judgement, and challenges fair argumentation; the information he has given from time to time, has stood the test of the severest scrutiny, and thus his reputation as a writer, is established beyond the injury of his enemies. If it were in the least material to the argument, or answered any one good purpose, he would not hesitate a moment in using his own signature; as it would not, but on the contrary, point where the shafts of malice could be levelled with most effect, and thus divert the public attention from the proper object, to a personal altercation, he from the first determined that the prying eye of party or curiosity, should never be gratified with his real name, and to that end to be the sole depository of the secret. He has been thus explicit to prevent the repetition of the weakness of declaring off, when charged with being the author, and to put the matter upon its true footing; however, it may flatter his vanity, that these papers should be ascribed to an illustrious patriot,� whose public spirit and undaunted firmness of mind, eclipse the most shining ornaments of the Roman commonwealth, in its greatest purity and glory, whose persevering exertions for the public welfare, have endeared him to his country, whilst it has made every knave and aspiring despot, his inveterate enemy, and who has never condescended to deny any writings that have been ascribed to him, or to notice the railings of party. Philadelphia, April 5th, 1788. (a) The application to Congress from our Legislature, was made upon the complaint of all the printers of newspapers in the city of Philadelphia."
Newspaper,No,Philadelphiensis,,Freeman's Journal,,4/9/1788,"My Fellow-Citizens, The essays under the signature of Philadelphiensis are represented as without argument, and their prime object is said to be to involve this devoted country in a civil war.1 But time, the discoverer of future events, will certainly shew that the calling another Federal Convention is the only rational way to prevent it. Heaven grant that these eyes may never behold that dreadful scene. The writer of these essays was actuated by the purest motives, namely, to defend the liberty and advance the happiness of his fellow-citizens. These he conceived insecure, or rather destroyed, if the proposed constitution should be established, and hence he laboured to procure another Convention. The expediency of this measure was demonstrated by illustrating the principal defects in the proposed system;�defects did I say�the expression is too soft�the ruin that must follow its adoption. If pointing out the unlimited powers of the new Congress over the lives and property of their fellow-citizens, which may and certainly would be abused, be not an argument against it, there remains no fixed determinate idea to be annexed to the term argument; indeed, on such principles right and wrong, freedom and slavery have no essential difference, and the human mind is a mere chaos. Some feeble attempts have been made by the advocates of this system of tyranny, to answer the objections made to the smallness of the number of representatives and senators, and the improper powers delegated to them; but, as far as I recollect, no one has been found bold enough to stand forth in defence of that dangerous and uncontrouled officer, the President-General, or more properly, our new King. A few pieces under the signature of An American Citizen2 were published immediately after the Constitution broke the shell, and the hydra made its way from the dark conclave into the open light; in the first number of which the writer, in touching on the President, endeavoured to conceal his immense powers, by representing the King of Great Britain as possessed of many hereditary prerogatives, rights and powers that he was not possessed of; that is, he shews what he is not, but [62]neglects to shew what he really is; but so flimsey a palliative could scarce escape the censure of the most ignorant advocate for such an officer; and since we hear of no further attempts to prove the necessity of a King being set over the freemen of America. The writer of these essays has clearly proven, that the president is a King to all intents and purposes, and at the same time one of the most dangerous kind too�an elective King, the commander in chief of a standing army, &c.;3 and to these add, that he has a negative over the proceedings of both branches of the legislature: and to complete his uncontrouled sway, he is neither restrained nor assisted by a privy council, which is a novelty in government. I challenge the politicians of the whole continent to find in any period of history a monarch more absolute. Who is so base as not to burn with resentment against the conspirators, who have dared to establish such a tyrant over his life, his liberty and property? Is the flame of sacred liberty so entirely extinguished in the American breast as not to be kindled again? No; you mistaken despots, do not let such a preposterous thought madden you into perseverance, lest your persons fall sacrifices to the just resentment of an injured country. Stop at once, and join the rest of your fellow-citizens. Let another Convention be immediately called, and let a system of government fitted to the pure principles of the Revolution, be framed. Then a general amnesty among all ranks and degrees of your fellow-citizens must succeed, and America become the seat of liberty, peace, friendship and happiness; and her government have ample energy and respectability among the nations of the earth; yea, she will thereby be rendered the great arbiter of the world."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer (PA),,Freeman's Journal,,4/16/1788,"Some weeks since there was published in the Carlisle Gazette an Address to the Minority of the late Convention of this State, under the signature of a Freeman, which I then supposed had been written by some well-meaning person of that place, who had not yet entered the porch of political knowledge, who was unacquainted with the nature of sovereignty, and incapable of distinguishing ministerial agency from the exercise of sovereignty; I therefore took no especial notice of it, until happening to see a Philadelphia Newspaper, I found the Address had originated there, and was ascribed to a gentleman who is far from being ignorant, as I had candidly supposed the author to be, but who hath habituated himself to presume much upon the supposed ignorance of the people, and whose expectations of future support and grandeur hath probably been very influential in framing and promoting the proposed system of government: I-Upon this discovery, I read the Address again with more attention, and resolved to communicate, thro' your useful paper, the result of my observations thereon. I do not, however, design to answer the Address in detail, but to establish and explain such general principles as may assist people in judging for themselves, and have a tendency to detect the sophistry which characterizes the performance. In order to do this, I shall explain, First, The NATURE of SOVEREIGNTY. Second, Of a FEDERAL REPUBLIC. Third, Of a CONSOLIDATED GOVERNMENT. Fourth, The NATURE of MINISTERIAL AGENCY. Fifth, Examine the ADDRESS to the MINORITY (the occasion of these Enquiries.) Sixth, Conclude with some GENERAL OBSERVATIONS on the TIMES. I return to the first then: From the very design that induces men to form a society that has its common interests and to promote and secure which it ought to act in concert, it is necessary that there should be established a public authority, to order and direct what ought to be done by each individual as he stands in relation to the society itself, or to the individual members thereof; and this public authority consisting of that portion of natural liberty which each member surrenders to the society to be exercised for the common advantage, is the sovereignty which is often called political authority. If this sovereignty or political authority be vested in and exercised by the whole people, as in some of the ancient republics, or if it be delegated to representatives chosen by the people from among themselves, as in modem times, the government is called a democracy. If on the contrary the sovereignty be in a particular class of citizens who have not a common interest with the people at large, or body of the nation, it is called an aristocracy;2 and if in a single person, a monarchy or despotism; and these three kinds may be variously combined and modified as in the British government and others, but every nation that governs itself by its own laws, let the form of government be what it may, is a sovereign state. Sovereignty therefore consists in the understanding and will of the political society, and this understanding and will is originally and inherently in the people; the society having rested it where and in what manner it pleases, he or they to whom it is delegated is the sovereign and is thus vested with the political understanding and will of the people for their good and advantage solely. The power of making rules or laws to govern or protect the society is the essence of sovereignty, for by this the executive and judicial powers are directed and controuled, to this every ministerial agent is subservient, and to this all corporate or privileged bodies are subordinate: this power not only regulates the conduct, but disposes of the wealth and commands the force of the nation. To keep this sovereign power therefore in due bounds hath fundamental laws, which we call constitutions and bills of rights, been made and declared. Scarcely hath the wisdom of man, matured by the experience of ages, been able with all the checks, negatives and balances either of ancient or modern invention to prevent abuses of this high sovereign authority. Here I may possibly be misunderstood; it may perhaps be objected, that in Great Britain the King is called the Sovereign, and that he is an executive and not legislative officer. True, the King of Great Britain is the Supreme Executive of the nation, but it is not this alone that constitutes him a Sovereign; he hath a negative over the Legislative, the laws are made by and with his consent, and are called the King's Laws; he calls. prorogues and dissolves his Parliament when he pleases; the Parliament indeed so manage. that the necessity of the case obliges him to convene them frequently, but he is not obliged to do it by the Constitution; so that, properly speaking. it is the King and Parliament of Great Britain which is sovereign.-However, if the Legislative authority were to be distributed in various portions, that man, or body of men, who should be vested with the sole and uncontrouled power of taxation, would eventually become the Sovereign, for whoever can command our whole property has the means in his power of ruling us as he pleases, because (as Montesquieu says) sovereignty necessarily follows the power of taxation."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,4/16/1788,"You will no doubt be astonished when I inform you that the election of members to serve in the approaching convention, have generally been decided in favor of the opponents to the new constitution. Indeed I do not hear of a single instance where an exertion has been made in the opposition to the system, that has not succeeded. Colonel Mason is returned for Stafford county—Colonel Grayson for Prince William—Mr. Patrick Henry for Prince Edward, and Mr. E. Randolph for Henrico; there remains not a doubt but the exertions of those able and truly patriotic characters, will be crowned with success; and that Virginia will, by a very decided majority, reject a measure which I am candid to own at first met with my approbation; but which, I am, on an investigation, convinced will endanger those liberties for which America gloriously contended, during an eight years war.”"
Newspaper,No,None of the Well-Born Conspirators,,Freeman's Journal,,4/23/1788,"In public disquisitions, especially political controversies, one of the parties generally adopt some cant word or phrase, whereby they may be distinguished from their opponents; and what renders the circumstance remarkably curious, the word or phrase is nineteen times out of twenty wrong applied. Thus in the party politics of Britain, under one administration candor was their shibbolith, when the most abusive, uncandid, and dirty mouthed scoundrels in the kingdom were the favourites of court; under another, economy, was the watch-word, yet profuseness and prodigality in public concerns, was then at their ne plus ultra; again, national honor, was buz[z]ed about, when not a fragment of honor, principle, or even national courage could be traced at court; this was in Lord North’s ever memorable administration. Now in an exact agreement with this plan, one of our American political parties, are incessantly bellowing out, federalism, federal measures, federal gentlemen, &c. &c. If the words, Federal, Federalism, &c. are to be taken in their general and common acceptation, as derived from Fedus, a league, or covenant, entered into for the mutual advantage of all; there cannot be found a greater abuse of words than in this instance; for our modern federalists, namely, the advocates of the new constitution, evidently aim at nothing but the elevation and aggrandizement of a few over the many. The liberty, property, and every social comfort in life of the yeomanry in America, are to be sacrificed at the altar of tyranny. Federalism then taken in this sense must imply something very remote from its original natural import; it must, (and truly there is no help for saying so) signify a league entered into against the sacred liberties of the people; that is in plain terms a conspiracy; and this is the fifth signification of the word Fedus, given by Ainsworth in his excellent Latin dictionary.1 Perhaps the consciences of the conspirators in the dark conclave urged them to assume a name which might be in some measure a key to disclose their perfidy.2 Conscience is a stern arbiter, and often compels us to witness against ourselves. Accompanied by such a faithful monitor the abettors of despotism adopted an epithet that should, when perfectly understood, be the true index to their base intentions. Take the word Federalism directly or indirectly, and it amounts neither to more nor less in its modern acceptation3 than a [206]conspiracy of the Well-born few, against the sacred rights and privileges of their fellow citizens."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer (PA),,Freeman's Journal,,4/23/1788,"Secondly. I shall proceed to define a FEDERAL REPUBLIC:- A Federal Republic is formed by two or more single or consolidated republics, uniting together by a perpetual confederacy, and without ceasing to be distinct states or sovereignties; they form together a federal republic or an empire of states. As individuals in a state of nature surrender a portion of their natural liberty to the society of which they become members, in order to receive in lieu thereof protection and conveniency; so in forming a federal republic the individual states surrender a part of their separate sovereignty to the general government or federal head, in order that, whilst they respectively enjoy internally the freedom and happiness peculiar to free republics, they may possess all that external protection, security, and weight by their confederated resources, that can possibly be obtained in the most extended, absolute monarchies. 4 The peculiar advantages and distinctive properties of a federal republic are. that each state or member of the confederation may be fully adequate for every local purpose, that it may subsist in a small territory, that the people may have a common interest, possess a competent knowledge of the resources and expenditures of their own particular government, that their immediate representatives in the state governments will know and be known by the citizens, will have a common interest with them, and must bear a part of all the burdens which they may lay upon the people, that they will be responsible to the people, and may be dismissed by them at pleasure; that therefore the government would be a government of confidence and possess sufficient energy without the aid of standing armies, that the collectors of the revenue would at least have the bowels of citizens, and not be the offscourings of Europe, or other states who have no interest in, or attachment to the people; that if one or more of the states should become the prey of internal despotism, or foreign foes, the other states may remain secure under the protection of their own state government; that if some popular and wealthy citizen should have influence enough to attempt the liberties of one state, he might be stopped in his career by the interposition of the others, for his influence could not be equally great in all the states; that if the general government should fail, or be revised or changed, yet the several state governments may remain entire to secure the happiness of the citizens; and that the members of a confederated republic may be encreased to any amount, and consequently its external strength without altering the nature of the government, or endangering the liberty of the citizens. The perfection of a federal republic consists in drawing the proper line between those objects of sovereignty which are of a general nature, and which ought to be vested in the federal government, and those which are of a more local nature and ought to remain with the particular governments; any rule that can be laid down for this must vary according to the situation and circumstances of the confederating states; yet still this general rule will hold good, viz. that all that portion of sovereignty which involve the common interest of all the confederating states, and which cannot be exercised by the states in their individual capacity without endangering the liberty and welfare of the whole, ought to be vested in the general government, reserving such a proportion of sovereignty in the state governments as would enable them to exist alone, if the general government should fail either by violence or with the common consent of the confederates; the states should respectively have laws, courts, force, and revenues of their own sufficient for their own security; they ought to be fit to keep house alone if necessary; if this be not the case, or so far as it ceases to be so, it is a departure from a federal to a consolidated government; and this brings me to the next particular, which is to shew what is meant by a consolidated government. 5 Thirdly. The idea of a CONSOLIDATED GOVERNMENT is easily understood, where a single society or nation forms one entire separate government, and possess the whole sovereign power; this is a consolidated or national government. Whether a government be of a monarchical, aristocratical or democratical nature, it doth not alter the case, it is either a federal or a consolidated government, there being no medium as to kind.-The absoluteness of a despotic sovereignty is often restricted by corporate bodies, who are vested with peculiar privileges and franchises-and by a just distribution of the executive and ministerial powers; but although these may contribute to the happiness of the people, yet they do not change the nature of the government. Indeed, monarchies can never form a federal government; they may enter into alliances with each other; for monarchy cannot be divested of a competent proportion of sovereignty to form a general government without changing its nature. It is only free republics that can completely and safely form a federal republic; I say free republics, for there are republics who are not free, such as Venice, where a citizen carrying arms is punished with instant death, and where even the nobles dare not converse with strangers, and scarcely with their friends, and are liable by law to be put to death secretly without trial-or Poland which, in much the same words that are expressed in the new system, is by a league with the neighbouring powers guaranteed to be forever independent and of a republican form; yet a writer of their own says, that the body of the people are scarcely to be distinguished from brutes; and again he says, we have reduced the people of our kingdom by misery to a state of brutes; they drag out their days in stupidity, &c. 6 Free republics are congenial to a federal republic. In order that a republic may preserve its liberty, it must not only have a good form of government, but it must be of small extent; for if it possess extensive territory, it would be ruined by internal imperfection. The authority of government in a large republic does not equally pervade all the parts; nor are the political advantages equally enjoyed by the citizens remote from the capital as by those in the vicinity; combinations consequently prevail among the members of the legislature, and this introduces corruption and is destructive of that confidence in government, without which a free republic cannot be supported; besides, the high influential trusts which must be vested in the great officers of state, would at particular times endanger the government, and are necessarily destructive of that equality among the citizens, which is the only permanent basis of a republic; in short, the diversity of the situation, habits, manners, and interests of the people in an extensive dominion, subjects the government to a thousand accidents, which would embarrass a republican government. The experience of nations and the nature of things, sufficiently prove, that the government of a single person, aided by armies and controuling influence, is necessary to govern a large consolidated empire. And on the other hand, if the territory be small, the republic is liable to be destroyed by external force, therefore, reason and observation points out a confederation of republics, as the only method to preserve internal freedom, together with external strength and respectability.-Small republics forming a federal republic on these principles, may be resembled to divers small ropes plaited together to make a large and strong one, if the latter is un3.14. II twisted, the small ropes are still useful as such, but if the former are untwisted, they are reduced to hemp, the original state. To apply these principles to our present situation without respect to the proposed plan of government; in order to render the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the confederating states, it is necessary not only that the general government should be properly constructed in its forms, but that it should be vested with powers relative to all the federal objects of government, these objects are not only the powers of making peace and war, &c. but also with the power of making treaties respecting commerce, regulating and raising revenues therefrom, &c. to make requisitions of money when necessity requires it, from each of the states, and a certain well described power of compelling delinquent states to pay up their quota of such requisitions. Perhaps if each state had its own share of the domestic debt quoted, so as they might each pay their own citizens, the general revenues would be sufficient for the other demands of the union in times of peace, if the government itself be not made too expensive by too great a number of officers being created. Congress ought, however, to have all powers which cannot be exercised by one state, without endangering the other states, such as the power of raising troops, treating with foreign nations, &c.- The power of levying imposts, will, by the particular states, be irregularly exercised, and the revenue in a great degree lost or misapplied, therefore, it ought not to be left with the states, but under proper checks, vested in the general government. All these the minority were amongst the foremost willing to have vested in the federal head, and more than this, had never been asked by Congress, nor proposed by the greatest advocates for congressional power, nor is more than this consistent with the nature of a federal republic. When the existing confederation was adopted, powers were given with a sparing hand, and perhaps, not improperly at that period, until experience should point out the discriminating line with sufficient experience, well knowing that it is easy for a government to obtain an encrease of power when common utility points out the propriety, but that powers once vested in a government, however dangerous they may prove, are rarely recovered without bloodshed, and even that awful method of regaining lost liberty is seldom effectual. It is now however evident that the power of regulating commerce, being of a general nature, ought to belong to the general government, and the burthen of debt incurred by the revolution hath rendered a general revenue necessary, for this purpose imposts upon articles of importation present themselves, not only as a productive source of revenue, but as a revenue for which the governments of the particular states are for well known reasons, imcompetent.- The danger of entrusting a government so far out of the people's reach as Congress must necessarily be, strongly impressed the public mind about four or five years since, but now a conviction of the advantage and probable safety of such a measure, pervades almost every mind, and none are more willing for putting it in operation, under proper guards, than the opposers of the new system; they are also willing to admit what the majority of the states may judge proper checks in the form of the general government, as far as those checks, or the distribution of powers and responsibility of those who be vested with those powers, may be consistent with the security of the essential sovereignty of the respective states. The minority of the convention 7 (who I really believe, in their address, express the serious sentiments of the majority of this state) opposed vesting such powers in Congress as can be most effectually exercised by the state governments in a full consistency with the general interests of the confederating states, and which, not being of a general nature, are not upon federal principles, objects of the federal government, I mean the power of capitation, or poll tax, by which the head, or in other words, the existence of every person is put in their power by the new system as a property, subject to any price or tax that may be judged proper; I do not mean to say that this implies the power of life and death, although it certainly implies the power of selling the property, or if none is to be had, of imprisoning or selling the person for a servant, who doth not chuse, or is not able to pay the poll tax; the minority also objected to vesting Congress with power to tax the property, real and personal of the citizens of the several states, to what amount, and in what manner it may please, without any check or controul upon its discretion; also to the unlimitted power over the excise; if this could extend only to spirituous liquors as is usual with us, the danger would be less, but the power of excise extends to every thing we eat, drink, or wear, and in Europe it is thus extensively put in practice. Under the term duties, every species of indirect taxes is included, but it especially means the power of levying money upon printed books, and written instruments. The Congress, by the proposed system, have the power of borrowing money to what amount they may judge proper, consequently to mortgage all our estates, and all our sources of revenue. The exclusive power of emitting bills of credit is also reserved to Congress. They have, moreover, the power of instituting courts of justice without tryal by jury, except in criminal cases, and under such regulations as Congress may think proper to decide, not only in such cases as arise out of all the foregoing powers, but in the other cases which are enumerated in the system. The absolute sovreignty in all the foregoing instances, as well as several others not here enumerated, are vested in the general government, without being subject to any constitutional check or controul from the state governments; It remains to examine the nature of the powers which are left with the states. and on this subject it is not necessary to follow Freeman through the numerous detail of particulars with which he confuses the reader. I shall examine only a few of the more considerable. The Freeman in his 2d Number, after mentioning in a very delusory manner divers powers which remain with the states, he says we shall find many other instances under the constitution which require or imply the existence or continuance of the sovereignty and severalty of the states; he as well as all the advocates of the new system, take as their strong ground the election of senators by the state legislatures, and the special representation of the states in the federal senate, to prove that internal sovereignty still remains with the states; therefore they say that the new system is so far from annihilating the state governments, that it secures them, that it cannot exist without them, that the existence of the one is essential to the existence of the other. 8 It is true that this particular partakes strongly of that mystery which is characteristic of the system itself; but if I demonstrate that this particular, so far from implying the continuance of the state sovereignties. proves in the clearest manner the want of it. I hope the other particular powers will not be necessary to dwell upon. The state legislatures do not chuse senators by legislative or sovereign authority. but by a power of ministerial agency as mere electors or boards of appointment; they have no power to direct the senators how or what duties they shall perform; they have neither power to censure the senators. nor to supercede them for misconduct. It is not the power of chusing to office merely that designates sovereignty. or else corporations who appoint their own officers and make their own bye-laws. or the heads of department who chuse the officers under them. such as commanders of armies. &c. may be called sovereigns. because they can name men to office whom they cannot dismiss therefrom. The exercise of sovereignty does not consist in chusing masters. such as the senators would be. who. when chosen. would be beyond controul. but in the power of dismissing. impeaching. or the like. those to whom authority is delegated. The power of instructing or superceding of delegates to Congress under the existing confederation. hath never been complained of. altho' the necessary rotation of members of Congress hath often been censured for restraining the state sovereignties too much in the objects of their choice. As well may the electors who are to vote for the president under the new constitution. be said to be vested with the sovereignty. as the state legislatures in the act of chusing senators. The senators are not even dependent on the states for their wages, but in conjunction with the federal representatives establish their own wages. The senators do not vote by states, but as individuals. The representatives also vote as individuals, representing people in a consolidated or national government; they judge upon their own elections, and, with the senate, have the power of regulating elections in time. place and manner, which is in other words to say, that they have the power of elections absolutely vested in them. That the state governments have certain ministerial and convenient powers continued to them is not denied, and in the exercise of which they may support, but cannot controul the general government. nor protect their own citizens from the exertions of civil or military tyranny, and this ministerial power will continue with the states as long as two-thirds of Congress shall think their agency necessary; but even this will be no longer than two-thirds of Congress shall think proper to propose, and use the influence of which they would be so largely possessed to remove it. 9 But these powers. of which the Freeman gives us such a profuse detail, and in describing which he repeats the same powers with only varying the terms, such as the powers of officering and training the militia, appointing state officers, and governing in a number of internal cases, do not any of them separately, nor all taken together, amount to independent sovereignty; they are powers of mere ministerial agency, which may, and in many nations of Europe, are or have been vested, as before observed, in heads of departments, hereditary vassals of the crown, or in corporations; but not that kind of independent sovereignty which can constitute a member of a federal republic, which can enable a state to exist within itself if the general government should cease. I have often wondered how any writer of sense could have the confidence to avow: or could suppose the people to be ignorant enough to believe, that, when a state is deprived of the power not only of standing armies (this the members of a confederacy ought to be) but of commanding its own militia, regulating its elections, directing or superceding its representatives or paying them their wages; who is, moreover, deprived of the command of any property, I mean source of revenue or taxation, or what amounts to the same thing, who may enact laws for raising revenue, but who may have these laws rendered nugatory, and the execution thereof superceded by the laws of Congress. This is not a strained construction, but the natural operation of the powers of Congress under the new constitution; for every object of revenue, every source of taxation, is vested in the general government. Even the power of making inspection laws, which, for obvious conveniency, is left with the several states, will be unproductive of the smallest revenue to the state governments; for, if any should arise, it is to be paid over to the coffers of Congress;-besides, the words to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, &c. give, without doubt, the power of repelling or forbidding the execution of any tax law whatever that may interfere with or impede the exercise of the general taxing power, and it would not be possible that two taxing powers should be exercised on the same sources of taxation without interfering with each other. May not the exercise of this power of Congress, when they think proper, operate not only to destroy those ministerial powers which are left with the states, but even the very forms? May they not forbid the state legislatures to levy a shilling to pay themselves, or those whom they employ, days wages? The state governments may contract for making roads (except post-roads) erecting bridges, cutting canals, or any other object of public importance; but when the contract is performed or the work done, may not Congress constitutionally prevent the payment? Certainly they may do all this and much more, and no man would have a right to charge them with breaking the law of their appointment. It is an established maxim, that wherever the whole power of the revenue or taxation is vested, there virtually is the whole effective, influential, sovereign power, let the forms be what they may: By this armies are procured, by this every other controuling guard is defeated. Every balance or check in government is only so far effective as it hath a controul over the revenue. The state governments are not only destitute of all sovereign command of, or controul over, the revenue or any part of it, but they are divested of the power of commanding, or prescribing the duties, wages, or punishments of their own militia, or of protecting their life, property or characters from the rigours of martial law. The power of making treason laws is both a flower lo and an important defence of sovereignty; it is relative to and inseparable from it; to convince the states that they are consolidated into one national government, this power is wholly to be assumed by the general government. 11 All the prerogatives, all the essential characteristics of sovereignty, both of the internal and external kind, are vested in the general government, and consequently the several states would not be possessed of any essential power, or effective guard of sovereignty. Thus I apprehend, it is evident that the consolidation of the states, into one national government (in contradistinction from a confederacy) would be the necessary consequence of the establishment of the new constitution, and the intention of its framers-and that consequently the state sovereignties would be eventually annihilated, though the forms may long remain as expensive and burthensome remembrances, of what they were in the days when (although labouring under many disadvantages) they emancipated this country from foreign tyranny, humbled the pride, and tarnished the glory of royalty, and erected a triumphant standard to liberty and independence. It is not my present object to decide, whether the government is a good or a bad one, it is only to prove in support of the minority, that the new system does not in reality, whatever its appearances may be, constitute a federal but a consolidated government.-From the distinguishing characteristics of these two kinds of government which I have stated, some assistance perhaps may be derived in judging which of them would be most suitable to our circumstances, and the best calculated to promote and secure the liberty and welfare of these United States. A few general observations shall conclude this essay. It is commonly said by the friends of the system, that the dangers which we point out are imaginary; that we ought to depend more upon the virtue of those who shall exercise those powers; that we talk as if we supposed men would be possessed of a daemon as soon as they should be vested with the proposed powers, &c. I shall in answer thereto join with a sensible reasoner in saying, that I will not abuse the new Congress until it exists, nor then until it misbehaves, nor then unless I dare; but it is a fact, that all governments that have ever been instituted amongst men, have degenerated and abused their power, and why we should conceive better of the proposed Congress than of all governments who have gone before us, I don't know; it is certainly incumbent on the supporters of this system, first to prove either that the uniform testimony of history, and experience of society, is false, or else that the new system will have the divine influence to inspire those who exercise the powers which it provides, with wisdom and virtue in an infallible degree. Surely the conduct of the framers and promoters of the new constitution, do not present mankind as more worthy of confidence now, than they have been in other periods of society. For proof of this let us examine facts. The legislature of the various states, elected members for a federal convention, without having authority for that purpose from their constituents; this gave no alarm, as necessity perhaps justified the measure, but how dangerous is the smallest precedent of usurped power, for the general convention when met, far out did the example-they were strictly bound by the law of their appointment to revise the confederation; the additional powers with which it ought to have been vested were generally understood, and would have been universally submitted to. This convention not only neglected the duty of their appointment, but assumed a power of the most extraordinary kind, they proceeded to destroy the very government which they were solemnly enjoined to strengthen and improve, and framed a system (to say no worse of it) that was destructive not only of the form, but of the nature of the government whose foundations were laid in the plighted faith and whose superstructure was cemented with the best blood of the United States. The legislature of this state, whose leading members were also self-chosen members of the general convention, no sooner had it in their power, than notwithstanding the solemn trust reposed in them, and still more solemn oath to preserve the constitution of this state inviolate, proceeded upon the expected last day of their session to call a convention, in order to adopt the proposed system of government before the people could be acquainted with it; and to carry this into execution, they added violence to perfidy, and by the aid of mob compelled members, sanctified by their presence, that usurped exertion of power, which their faith and trust obliged them to discountenance. The consequence was, that about one-sixth of the citizens only obeyed the irregular call of the assembly, and elected members to the state convention: one-third of those members, and who were chosen by nearly one-half of the voters who did elect, voted against the adoption of the new constitution, and being refused the right of entering their testimony on the minutes, laid their conduct and their reasons before their constituents. About five out of six of the people, whether disdaining to obey a call which neither the general convention or assembly were authorised to make, or whether being taken by surprise, they were not sufficiently informed to act with decision, and therefore did not choose to act at all: I cannot tell, but so it is, that they have not yet publicly declared their sentiments for, nor have done any thing in favor of the proposed system: In this situation Pennsylvania hath adopted the system. It is a very serious question, whether supposing nine states had agreed to it in this manner, the system would be practicable, whether general confidence would not be necessary unless we had greater resources. In addition to Pennsylvania, Georgia, Delaware, New-Jersey, and Connecticut, have also adopted the system; these states are not only small, but in a high degree delinquent, and there is no provision made in the new constitution to compel delinquent states or persons to make up their deficiencies. The convention of Massachusetts have adopted the system with a solemn disapprobation, they have pointed out amendments on the same parchment with the act of ratification, and have solemnly enjoined those who may be the first deputies in the new Congress, to exert their every endeavours to have these amendments made part of the constitution, and to add weight to them, they have officially requested Pennsylvania and the other states to concur in the propositions of amendment. The New-Hampshire convention have, on motion of the friends of the system, adjourned until June, in order to prevent an immediate rejection, which otherwise was unavoidable, the adjournment was carried by only three voices. At present there is and will for some months be a solemn and serious pause, a time of deliberation, the result of which will fill an important page in the history of human society. For my own part I think the heaviest clouds are dispersed, and the gloomy darkness admits the chearing rays of hope, which promise meridian splendour to the sun of liberty. Most of those who were from the best motives friends to the system, have penetrated the shade of mystery in which it was wrapped, they see the snares, and discover the delusions with which it is replete, they see that every other system of government whether good or bad, is easy to be understood, but that this system excels all of the kind which hath come to their knowledge in darkness and ambiguity; they have been informed too, that this mysterious veil was the fruit of deliberation and design. Whilst posts are prevented from carrying intelligence, whilst newspapers are made the vehicles of deception, and dark intrigue employs the avaricious office-hunters, who long to riot on the spoils of their country, the great body of the people are coolly watching the course of the times, and determining to preserve their liberties, and to judge for themselves by the principles of reason and common sense, and not by the weight of their names.

Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,4/25/1788,"Another correspondent observes, that the party who calls themselves federalists will soon change their name, since the term federalism has been so clearly proved, in an ingenious way in the Freeman’s Journal, to mean a conspiracy, and this without any strained construction. It may be presumed that the bulk of the federalists would not be well pleased to have themselves called conspirators, in common conversation, and yet this is a necessary consequence of being denominated federalists. "
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,5/5/1788,"The opposition to the new constitution in Maryland, says a correspondent, labored under many disadvantages, and the little exertion they made, early evinced that the others had stolen to the windward of them. In the first place, the press was not free till the people were generally prejudiced in favor of this mysterious system, by the artful management of its advocates; and when Mr. Martin’s information was published, it was only in one newspaper at Baltimore2 (the extremity of the state); which could be seen by few in the country. (We find it had effect in the town and in the counties adjacent.) In the next place, the aristocratic party in that state is considerable, and devoted to the nod of its leaders. And the very idea of Mr. Martin’s being connected with the opposition, was sufficient to prejudice the tories (who are another considerable part of the state) in favor of the system; Mr. Martin being very unpopular among that class of citizens owing to the office he holds.3 Thus the tories and aristocratics united, together with the wish [718]of all to grant farther powers to Congress, the example of the other states in adopting the system, the industry of the advocates of it in circulating sophistical publications, and delusive and electioneering falsehoods among the people, and promising to recommend the necessary amendments with the adoption of it, procured the great majority they had in convention. And here again, they excluded all debate, fearing it would open the eyes of the deluded members; (does not this shew the badness of their cause?) And being thus deluded we find that this body of men as implicit to the direction of their leader (McHenry)4 as the majority of our packed convention was to Mr. Wilson;5 and does not the conduct of these leaders fully shew the designs of the junto on the continent, who are endeavoring to take from us our liberties? Have they not been amusing us with an idea of procuring amendments, and that, like Massachusetts, the states should recommend amendments with the adoption?6 But has the convention of Maryland (alias Mchenry and his sticklers) recommended any amendments? No, they have not!7 This should teach those who have been annoyed with such fallacious hopes, that such ideas were only held out by the junto for the moment to carry their point; and that, like the Maryland convention, our new Congress once vested with unbounded sway, will never relinquish a single item, will never listen to the calls for amendments or the least security of our rights and privileges, which are intended to be laid at their feet! No, while they have a military force to back their despotic decrees, they may laugh at the people? But it is to be hoped this treachery in Maryland will be a lesson to the six remaining states, and teach them to reject and then amend. Secure your invaluable rights and liberties, and be not swayed by the insidious arts and practices of the designing or the mercenary cries of the deluded: the sons of Virginia, of the Carolinas, the honest sons of New-Hampshire and New-York; the blood of thousands of your virtuous brethren who fell in the late glorious cause of liberty, cry aloud to you, to preserve and hand down to your posterity those rights and privileges in defence of which they fell martyrs!"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,5/9/1788,"The present controversy, says a correspondent, respecting the new leviathan or proposed constitution for the United States, has exhibited the talents of the Americans in a most exalted point of view. Never did any subject produce a greater display of ingenuity, knowledge, wit, and powerful eloquence. The writings under the signatures of Centinel, Philadelphiensis, Brutus, a Countryman, and Farmer, are full of political wisdom�The information of Mr. Martin, and the dissent of the minority of Pennsylvania, contain a complete system of republican government. To these performances nothing has been opposed but the sophistry of Mr. Wilson, the low similies of Mr. M'Kean, such as�""if the sky should fall, we should catch larks, and if the rivers should run mud, we should catch eels""�the dry trash of Publius in 150 numbers�the divine allegories of Galen, the triffling railleries of the little Admiralty Judge, impudent assertions and calumnies against those who have had resolution and independency of spirit to animadvert on the new constitution, and on the conduct of its framers�Extracts of letters from Maryland, Virginia, Boston, &c. composed in Philadelphia�ribaldry�scurrility�seditious falsehoods�or, to use a word which includes them all, and every thing else that is infamous, base and wicked�nothing but Rushisms."
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,5/10/1788,"Mr. Printer, Though religious creeds have long since been deemed quite useless, or rather indeed extremely prejudicial to the interests of virtue and true piety; yet I must at the same time be of opinion, that political creeds are of a very different nature, and that no government, and least of all an arbitrary one, can be supported without some such summary of its credenda, or articles of faith. Our late C——n, sensible of the truth of this maxim, have taken care to draw up a very [5]full and comprehensive creed for the use of their creatures and expectants, who are obliged to believe and maintain every article of it, right or wrong, on pain of political damnation. And to do those slavish expectants justice, there never was on earth a set of more firm and sincere believers; nor any who were willing to run greater risques in defence of their political dogmas. This political creed however is no new invention: ’tis the old tory system revived by different hands. And the articles of it can be a secret to no one, who has the misfortune to converse with any of its advocates: But as such doctrines and maxims would better become the slave of a Bashaw of three tails than the subject of a free republican government, I shall just take the liberty, by way of specimen, to mention a few of these articles for the sake of your more uninformed readers. And 1. They maintain that the revolution and the declaration of independence, however important at those periods, are now to be considered as mere farces, and that nothing that was then done ought to be any bar in the way of establishing the proposed system of arbitrary power. 2. That as most of the European nations are in a state of vassalage and slavery, the Americans easily may be brought to a similar situation, and therefore ought to be reduced to the same abject condition. 3. That to compass this end, a large standing army should be kept up in time of peace, under the specious pretence of guarding us against foreign invasions and our frontiers against the savages; but in reality to overawe and enslave the people, who, if provoked at the violation of their rights, should at any time dare to murmur or complain, the military should be employed to bayonet them for their arrogance and presumption. 4. That to say the late convention was not authorised by the people at large to form an aristocratic, consolidated system of government for them, but merely to recommend alterations and amendments of the good old articles of confederation, is downright treason and rebellion. 5. That to assert that it was a shameful departure from the principles of the revolution and republicanism, and a base violation of the trust reposed in them, is a crime of the deepest dye, and never to be forgiven. 6. That if any man in the course of his writings should happen to give offence to a haughty favorite of the junto, it should be an express condition in the admission of every person into the new administration, that he concur in the prosecution of the author, or printer (or both if the name of the author can be extorted or discovered, no matter how vile and infamous the means) to the utmost rigor of the law, and even in contradistinction to all law and justice. 7. That the trial by jury, whether in civil or criminal cases, ought to be entirely abolished, and that the judges only of the new federal court, appointed by the well born in the ten-mile-square, should determine all matters of controversy between individuals. 8. That the trial by jury ought likewise to be abolished in the case of libels, and every one accused of writing or even publishing a libel, ought to be tried by informations, attachments, interrogatories, and the other arbitrary methods practised in the court of star-chamber. 9. That a libel is whatever may happen to give offence to any great man, or old woman; and the more true the charge, the more virulent the libel. 10. That an unrestrained liberty of the press should be granted to those who write and publish against the liberties of the people, but be absolutely denied to such as write against unconstitutional measures, and the abominable strides of arbitrary power, which have recently been attempted by any of the rump conclaves or conventions. 11. That the people indeed have no rights and privileges but what they enjoy at the mercy of the rich lordlings, who may, of right, deprive them of any or of all their liberties whenever they think proper. 12. That the freemen of America have no right to think for themselves, nor to chuse their own officers of government, who ought to be named and appointed by the king elect, the half king and the senate; these being evidently much better judges of what is for the good of the people than the people themselves. 13. That a bill of rights and other explicit declarations in favor of the people, are old musty things, and ought to be destroyed; and that for any set of men to declare themselves in favor of a bill of rights, is a most daring insult offered to General Washington and Doctor Franklin, who, it must be allowed by the whole world, are absolutely infallible. 14. That those men are best qualified to conduct the affairs of a free people, who breathe nothing but a spirit of tyranny, and who, by their violent, illegal, and unconstitutional (consolidating, energetic, as they are pleased to stile it) procedures, have well nigh reduced the good people of this great continent to the very eve of a civil war: And that as soon as nine states should accede to the new system of slavery, every one who would presume to lisp a syllable against it, ought to be taken up, imprisoned, and punished at the discretion of the judges of the supreme federal court. Such are a few of the many articles of the political creed of the federal hacks, and how firmly they believe and diligently act up to them, is a matter of equal notoriety and grief to every real patriot in America."
Newspaper,No,A Freeman,,Independent Gazetteer,,5/15/1788,"The conduct of the majority in the Maryland convention is a striking display of the nature of power, and a sample of what the freemen of America would experience from the great Congress if established: inebriated with a temporary superiority, they arrogantly refused to discuss the merits of a system of government that was to determine the fate of a great people, that would prove either the instrument of their freedom and prosperity or of their slavery and misery for ages to come, but observed a contemptuous silence, notwithstanding some of the greatest and most able men in Maryland, with all the ardour of patriotism, represented the dangers with which the new constitution was replete, and repeatedly urged the majority to invalidate their objections if in their power; a greater insult than this was never offered to freemen, and the infatuation of the people must indeed be astonishing if they are not aroused by it to a sense of the imposition practising upon them under the sanction of a Washington. The conduct of the Maryland convention also shews the folly of trusting to future amendments; for they have already thrown aside the masque, and avowed the intention of establishing the new constitution in all its plentitude of powers, without any reservation in favor of the liberty of the people. After amusing the minority with hopes that suitable amendments would be recommended by them, they at length in a despotic manner dissolved the convention. What must be the feelings of the great body of the people in Massachusetts, who were deluded into the adoption of this system of government, by specious assurances that the amendments would be acceded to by all the states, and certainly incorporated in the government,2 that it argued ignorance of the weight of Massachusetts in the union, to entertain the smallest doubt that her example would not be followed by all the others? I rejoice that the rash confidence of the advocates of the new constitution, has led them to discover so soon this dangerous, deceptive game of the amendments, by which they had imposed upon so many. The question now is simply, Whether the people will submit to the absolute establishment of a form of government, which all, even [734]the most designing are obliged to allow, is defective? I recommend the perusal of the narrative of facts and propositions of amendment, subscribed by the minority of the Maryland convention, to every person who wishes to continue free."
Newspaper,No,,,State Gazette of South Carolina,,5/15/1788,"“I sincerely believe that if a bill of rights had been added, the proposed constitution would have been received with almost unanimous approbation every where—(Rhode-Island always excepted).—Tho’ I confess myself a friend to a high-toned government, yet the omission of a declaration of a bill of rights, essential as it is to a free people, I consider as a serious defect—notwithstanding what hath been urged to the contrary.—That clause1 which raises the authority of congress paramount to the laws and constitution of this state, exposes those great rights of the people which ought ever to be reserved to the inroads of that ambition ever active in man, when unshackled by restraint: And however happy and seemingly secure the present generation may be under such a power, yet we owe something to posterity—who will have most to apprehend from its influence, thus sanctioned by the choice [284page icon]of their forefathers, made in an hour of freedom and of peace—their complaints would have less weight and be less attended to than if the object of them had grown (like most other governments) out of force, fraud, or chance.—Upon the whole, however, I admire the out-lines of the plan, and think we had better adopt it as it stands, than risk, at this critical juncture, the chance of getting a worse, or of remaining, if we can remain under the present wretched and ruinous plan of confederation—The alterations needful might be made, petitioned for by the people, and demanded by the states, as soon as the government should be organized—acquiescence in the new congress would cement the federal plan with the public affections, stamp it with energy, and make it the glory of America, and the admiration of the world.”"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,6/30/1788,"As soon as the intelligence [of NY’s ratification] reached the city a number of Federalists, as the impudent tories, refugees, and those who have fostered in the bosom of the our enemies during the late contest with Great Britain call themselves, assembled in the night, when everything was hused in silence and repose, and attacked the dwelling of Mr. Thomas Greenleaf, the Editor of the old New York Journal, and destroyed the printing apparatus, because, it is said, some of the above mentioned gentry are displeased at the account given in that paper of last Tuesday’s parade."
