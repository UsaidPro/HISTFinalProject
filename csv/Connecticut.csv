Letter,No,Benjamin Gale,Connecticut Journal,,,10/1/1787,"Messrs. Printers: I request you would insert the following in your next. In your Journal of the 10th instant, under the Philadelphia head, you give us this intelligence: “From the time the resolution of Congress was passed till its adoption by the State of Pennsylvania was only twenty hours—such is the zeal of Pennsylvania to show her attachment to a vigorous, free, and wise frame of national government.” I would only observe that power once resigned into the hands of civil rulers never was regained but by blood. I would submit it therefore to the public, whether this hasty, and sudden adoption, of the report of the Convention, on the recommendation of Congress, argues more of the wisdom and prudence of the legislature of Pennsylvania than of the arts and intrigues of designing men among them thus suddenly and impetuously to crowd the adoption of the recommendation of Congress, before either the people or their civil rulers would have had time duly to consider and weigh all the consequences of adopting that form of government, recommended to the states by the Convention, which seems to be wrapped up in terms, not easy to be understood, which inclines me to think that the diction or phraseology of the report of the Convention was carefully studied before it was made public, and probably not fully understood by the people or every member of the legislature of Philadelphia who adopted it so expeditiously. [P.S.] That state has raised expectations of being made the seat of government which [will] naturally throw into it the riches and wealth of all the states in the Union—and as an evidence this is their views, have already made Congress a grant of the exclusive right of legislation of an extent of territory sufficient for the erection of forts, magazine, arsenals, hotels, palaces, hotels for and other necessary buildings.2"
Newspaper,No,The People,,New Haven Gazette,,10/11/1787,"To the Honorable the Representatives of the State of Connecticut, in General Assembly convened. Respected Sirs: We your constituents, confiding in your wisdom and integrity, are happy that the consideration of the national, as well as separate interests, falls at a period when so much unanimity and harmony prevail in our councils, as we have good reason to hope we are blessed within this present instance. Nothing gives us at all times so much inward joy as to hear that unanimity of sentiment is stamped upon every important act. It adds weight to your authority and dignifies the precept. We have not chosen you to stand in our stead that you might the more conspicuously display the talents you severally possess of combating the sentiments of each other upon the maxims of Cicero, or at blacking the visage of the man who has the misfortune to oppose you. However fashionable these exploits may have been, they do not constitute the errand on which you were sent. And as there is and ever has been a constant revolution in all manners, habits, and customs, either ancient or modern, some in quicker and others in a more dull succession, we hope upon this principle the time is come for the passing away of this baneful usage, a custom not less barbarous in society than the hideous daubings of the tawny tribes. It has carried many a shaft to the heart; it has caused many wounds in the bosoms of men, perhaps more worthy than him who drew the bow. Some have a talent at one exercise and some at another. Some are skilled at the use of one weapon and some at another. This being the established order of human life, no one can be branded because he doth not possess every talent; and that man must be barbarous in ethics, who, expert with a sword, would gash his brother to show the keenness of its edge. But from the last sessions, we are happy to learn that milder days are now begun, and that all unite in discarding the acrimony of former times. Your constituents will not wish to see their political interest more secure than they are confident they will be, when in oneness of sentiment and pursuit, they observe their rulers studying those methods of national security which, according to the integrity of their hearts, appear to be the ordinance of Heaven. In this, they are willing to confide, trusting that the same power, which hath placed their feet upon dry land, will not suffer them to perish while following the pointings of His Providence. To determine what are the positive pointings of Providence in regard to the duties of men, either in a national or single capacity, requires, perhaps, a stretch of wisdom more than we can always [361]fathom. In such an uncertain case, we can only determine the will of Heaven by comparing our present situation with some former one similar in kind, in which we followed the dictates of our own wisdom with a conscious dependence on infinite wisdom for further direction, and thus resting the event. If there are any such instances wherein the God of Heaven hath, either in a public or private capacity, crowned our pious endeavors and amply rewarded the confidence we placed in His supremacy, need we fear again to follow the same path which He hath thus sanctified with His blessing? Unless infinite wisdom errs, or under the same circumstances, follows different steps, or lastly, unless the arm of the Almighty is shortened that He cannot save, we may receive this method of instruction as an infallible guide. This gives us a key to the movings of Providence, which in every other view look dark and mysterious. Experience is allowed to be the most infallible teacher. And if in any subsequent transactions we are confident that the same genuine principles of integrity direct our steps, as in former times, we may no doubt expect the same favorable answer from above. Though the Almighty may order events different at different times, even when the outward circumstances of a people are the same; yet we are warranted to say that sameness of genuine principles, under the same circumstances, will warrant sameness of success. In the present state of political uncertainty, would it not be wise to search for some similar instance in which following the steps of our own wisdom, with a pious dependence and solemn appeal to Heaven, we have received the reward of our hopes? Is there no such instance? Are there not many instances parallel to the present by which we may, by a serious and unprejudiced attention, learn our present duty? Did not our Revolution commence? Hath it not been continued ever since upon the same plan? Have we not encountered dangerous scenes, the issue of which our own wisdom could not fathom, but which, being recommended by those entrusted with our political concerns, we have encountered and, in a dependence on the divine blessing, have found our labor crowned with ample success? We trust there are none of you so ignorant of the movings of our political system, during the present Revolution, as to say that we have never trusted Providence in the dark, and if you remember such instances, you cannot say that we were in any instance disappointed. Our Revolution is yet but half completed; we have escaped the evils which threatened us from a foreign quarter, but we have not attained the positive blessings which we promised ourselves from the establishment of a free and independent empire. The truth is, such an empire is not yet established. In vain have we, for four years, pursued a phantom, a shadow without substance, an effect without a cause. We have sought the blessings [362]of freedom without being free. No matter whether we are shackled at home or abroad; so be our feeble efforts are always frustrated and our fetters so riveted that we cannot use our strength in our own defense. We are, in a national capacity, shackled both at home and abroad. And the propensities of designing men wait only to be loosed, and we should become an easy prey. But this Revolution is still to be pushed—it must be perfected—the prospects which warmed our breasts, while pursuing this Revolution through the field of Mars, must be brought home to our quiet possession. Until this is done, our object is but half attained; our hopes are but half fulfilled; and we are but too moderately grateful for the deliverance which hath been already wrought in our behalf. We will not grate your understandings so much as to recite the thousand inconveniencies, losses, and disappointments we sustain through want of a perfection of this mighty fabric. The God of Heaven hath crowned our labors and rewarded our enterprise thus far. If Canaan’s rest is to bound our march, shall we, who have done mighty deeds, be affrighted back because it is reported giants and Anakims dwell there? We choose not to stand aghast and be affrighted from our right because of ill reports. Are we, the people who have thrown down the walls of Jericho, to be afraid of giants? If such there are, they are but images of our own forming, and if, on nearer view, they prove too mighty, the same that made them can make them less. We have thrown down one mighty form of gigantic force; and it is a task too hard for man to say, when a creature of our own forming can arise to equal height. Tis children’s play to be affrighted in the dark with images which imagination only paints. Was there a voice from Heaven forbidding to go forward, well might we, trembling, retire; but when that voice, which has ever to us interpreted the will of Heaven, gently bids us go forward, may we not pursue?"
Letter,No,Benjamin Gale,William Samuel Johnson,,,11/13/1787,"When I had the pleasure of seeing you after your return from Convention, I congratulated you on the wisdom and prudence you discovered in accepting the presidency of your university, and assigned my reasons to you.2 The last and principal one was that I thought you had wisely and judiciously stepped out of the Political Circle at a time when a scene of blood and carnage was approaching, and I conceived advancing by rapid strides, which I told you I thought I could make very evident to you, being a gentleman of good sense and a Revelationist, in which I also most firmly believe. And, if I am able only to render my opinion in this matter highly probable, you certainly will not again mingle with the politicians of this world, whereby you probably may endanger your own neck. This, sir, is my main design by this epistle, and I wish you to accept of it as an evidence of my sincere friendship and attachment to your interest. Now dear doctor, viewing the prophecies and the period we are now under as I do, did I not do well to advise you as I did, and now do, to keep out of the political circle, if you intend to save your neck? We yesterday met to choose delegates. There was about 150 voters present, and we chose 2 delegates to meet in Convention. One was chose by 14 votes and the other had 13. All the others would not vote at all and are really against it, but you gentlemen of the [Constitutional] Convention have fobbed off our Assembly and the people nicely.3 You referred your doings to Congress—Congress referred the matter to the Assembly—but our Assembly had nothing to do but to order the towns to meet, which they did in less than a fortnight from the rising of the Assembly—and, when they came to read the act of Assembly, they thought something was referred to them to accept or reject it. But they found they had no right to determine anything. Their business was only to choose delegates to say w[hethe]r we shall or shall not submit to it; and so in choosing our King President, our Assembly have No voice in the matter, only to choose 7 Electors, to choose a King President for four years, and then to have another squabble again. No Elective King—an Hereditary King is preferable and if we have not Lords, we have a plenty of Lordly Fellows; and we can furnish Congress as many Queer Dukes as they want. To be short, it is an artful, dark, mysterious, complex, expensive form of government. However, I conjecture it will pass, and, if it doth, any power ceded into the hands of the civil magistrate never was given back, nor were they ever recovered without shedding of Blood, which I fear will not be long—for Military Civil Rulers are apt to [460]ride hard. As to this, I have now said all I have to say. Another thing I told you, I was glad you had accepted of the presidency. I was in hopes you would have both leisure and inclination to correct and amend the blunders in my dissertations on the Prophetick Writings and my Dissertation on the End of the World, and that you would do me the favor to introduce my grandson into one of the academies, if he should be found capable of the business, as it will doubtless be in your power to do much for him in that way, when he shall have accomplished his studies, if found deserving. A clergyman I am unwilling he should be, as they are a cruel, hardhearted set of gentlemen, take them collectively, for they think our Savior died only for the Elect, who, as near as I can compute, is not more than 1 in 10,000. All the rest, they are not willing should, in any future state of existence under some future dispensation not yet revealed, but as St. Peter tells us, is Ready to be Revealed in the Last Times, have any chance to become willing subjects in some moral way, and Bow the Knee to the Messiah’s scepter, although He has sworn by Himself that Every Knee Shall Bow, and Every Tongue Shall Confess—but all these they are quite willing should be damned Eternally. I can’t but think these governing principles makes so many of them willing to adopt the new Constitution, which restrains Congress from Regulating Trade by the prohibition of African slaves for 21 years to come, that they, not being of the Elect, might begin their State of Punishment early in the day before they pass into the other world."
Newspaper,No,The People,,New Haven Gazette,,12/10/1787,"As the new Constitution so called is a matter of the greatest importance to this country, to which it behooveth everyone to contribute his mite, we therefore presume to show our opinion and we are sorry to see that some have written in a style bordering upon enthusiastic madness and in that way extol the great and good men and some undispected [sic] sections in the draft; and though we wish to see the Congress possessed of as much power as the case requires, we do not wish them possessed of more. We therefore take the liberty to say we think there [is] in that Constitution very ambiguous, dangerous, and unnecessary matter. We would further premise that the least ambiguity is dangerous, as this is in the nature of a grant and is, as all other grants, to be taken strongest against us the grantors. We therefore hold that if there is anything that may be made an ill use of, it should be corrected. Doubtless those good men that formed it thought they would make a good use of all the powers, but we query whether any body of men ever did not carry their powers to the extent. The first objection we make to it is the grant of power the Congress will have of all our estates by impost, excise, and taxation unlimited and to put as much of that money in their own pockets as they please. This is an unlimited grant—and we think it would have been better to have had the representation dependent on the state legislatures for their pay, and then they would have been under less temptation to have made excessive grants to the [Senate or others?]; but as it now stands, they are under temptation to say to the Senate, as some British officers do, if we give you a goose, you can afford to give us a feather. We have heard but one reason why the deputies should pay themselves and that is the fear that the state legislatures would not give them what is adequate. If this reason is true, it is a very bad one; but we do not think it well founded. We know those gentlemen that went first to Congress had as much as they asked for, and all that have been since, we understand, have had more. We cannot perceive why the Congress should have the power of controlling our elections of our deputies as to time, place, and mode. We know of no reason why they should interfere with our [495]common law courts (which have stood an hundred and fifty years equal in rectitude to any in the world) and impose upon us a court of appeals in the common law to judge in equity law and fact denying the benefit of a jury, on credit the only security of property to the common or poor people; and as it is the only thing that has saved the British people from tyranny, we think it is the only thing that will save us as to that high court. We are sorry to say we think it would be the direct road to bribery and corruption. Let Congress have all the powers that is necessary for them and let them be therewith content."
Letter,No,Hugh Ledlie,John Lamb,,,1/15/1787,"The length of time since our acquaintance first commenced in New York about the years 1765 and 1766 makes me almost diffident whether you continue the same patriot and friend to your country. I then found you together with [Isaac] Sears, [Thomas] Robinson, [William] Wiley, [Gershom] Mott, [Edward] Light [Laight], [John Morin] Scott, [Jonathan?] Hazard, etc., etc., and many others whose names I have forgot, a committee for opposing the diabolical and oppressive Stamp Act, when [Lewis] Pintard, [Charles] Williams, etc., were brought to the stool or rather stage of repentance for acts of high crimes and misdemeanors committed against the then Sons of Liberty throughout the continent.2 But to return, I say, I should not have dared to venture a line to you on the subject I am about to say a few words upon, if I had not accidentally seen your name with others (good men) in some of our public newspapers handled in a very rough, ungentlemanlike manner3—but even then I remained ignorant who those scurrilous, defamatory, backbiting writers meant, until a few days since being in company with General James Wadsworth who first told me it was you, and added an anecdote. The other day, or some time since, a gentleman, one Mr. [Alexander] Hamilton, meeting you in the street, asked you how you could be so much against the new Constitution, for it was pretty certain your old good friend General Washington would in all probability be the first President under it. To which you replied, that in that case all might be well, but perhaps after him General Slushington might be the next or second President. This, sir, was the very first hint [576]I had of your opposing it and was confirmed in the same by the opprobrious, indecent, and, I believe, false speeches made use of at our late Convention in this place by some sly, mischievious insinuations, viz., that out of the impost, £8000 was paid by this state annually to the State of New York; out of which you received upwards of £900, which enabled you and others to write the Federal Farmer and other false libels and send them into this and the neighboring states to poison the minds of the good people against the good Constitution. They say a [John] Lamb, a [Marinus] Willet, a [Melancton] Smith, a [George] Clinton, and a [Robert] Yates’s salaries are paid by this state through your state impost.4 The late Convention, which met in this town the 3d instant and voted the new Constitution the 9th in the evening and finished the 10th, was carried on, by what I can learn, with a highhand against those that disapproved thereof. For, if I am not misinformed, when the latters were speaking, which by the bye were far from being the best orators (a few excepted), they were browbeaten by many of those Ciceroes, as they think themselves, and others of superior rank, as they call themselves, as also by the unthinking deluded multitude, who were previously convened as it is thought by many, for that purpose; which together with shuffling and stamping of feet, coughing, talking, spitting, and whispering, as well by some of the members as spectators, with other interruptions, etc., etc., too many to be here enumerated, which I am told is true, for I was not there myself, being at that time confined by a slight touch of the gout. All these menaces and stratagems were used by a junto who tries to carry all before them in this state, as well by writing as every other diabolical and evil pretense. And as the presses in this state are open to them, but evidently shut against all those that would dare and presume to write on the other side against the new Constitution, they have greatly the advantage and, by these means, stigmatize everyone they think acts or thinks to the contrary of what they say or do. Witness our late Landholder [Oliver Ellsworth] and some others of the same class against Richard Henry Lee, Esquire, Mr. [George] Mason, Mr. [Elbridge] Geary, etc., etc.;5 yet, notwithstanding all their long labored, scurrilous, vindictive, bitter, malicious, and false insinuations, there was found in our Convention forty-one [forty] righteous men that did not bow the knee to Baal, but, in the midst of all the storms of reproaches, etc., etc., stood their ground firm tho 127 [128] of those (called by some, of the first rank by their soft, smooth speeches) just at the close voted for the new Constitution, a Constitution that in the end will work the ruin of the freedom and liberty of these thirteen disunited states. I am not alone in this opinion, for there are many [577]of the first abilities in this and the neighboring states with whom I correspond, as well by letters as otherways, besides the above 41, that think this new Constitution a gilded pill. But some of them, notwithstanding the gilding is so artfully laid on, can discern the arsenic and poison through the outside coloring—and our good printers (after the nag was stolen, I think after they had spent all their venom which came from the quills of the junto in favor of the new Constitution and just before the sitting of our Convention) then and not till then they published a pompous libel, that then and at all times they would publish on both sides.6 But the D[evi]l trust them, says many that from principle are against the new Constitution, and so none that I know of was ever sent them, well knowing it must run the gauntlet through all these infernal grub street, hireling, scurrilous scribblers, that watch and guard the posts of the printers’ doors in this town, and who are daily attending for the selfsame purpose of disjointing, mangling, and torturing every piece that don’t please their palate. This, sir, is some of the reasons why so few or none are sent. Another reason is, they have got almost all the best writers (as well as speakers) on their side, tho we vie with and, I believe, overbalance them in point of honesty and integrity. The piece alluded to as above teems with trying to sow discord and contention between the United States by insinuating that Richard H. Lee, Esquire has [been] and is a great enemy to General Washington, and that he endeavored to get his cousin, General [Charles] Lee, to be commander of our late army, etc., etc.7 In short, they leave, as the old saying is, no stone unturned, but they compass sea and land. They rake H[el]l and skim the D[evi]l to make one proselyte, and when they have found him, they make him twofold more the child of h[el]l than he was before. This proverb is of late verified by their turning from light to darkness—Copper [Joseph Hopkins], Wimble [William Williams], and some others, whom at present I’ll forbear to name. We that are against the new Constitution are stigmatized by those mighty men of Moab by the opprobrious name of Wrongheads. If they are named right, I believe there is a majority in this state against the new Constitution, for it is thought by the best judges that if the freemen, etc., of this state could be convened together in one body, the greatest number would vote against the new proposed Constitution, notwithstanding all that is held out to the people at large in the public newspapers in this state. We wish here we had some of your good writers and a free press. We would souse some of our upstart sons of Apollo that pretend to great things. One worthless man that gains what he pretends disgusts a thousand unpretending friends trials light as air,–are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs of Holy Writ—the wise too jealous are fools too secure—Beware, beware, beware for I apprehend a dreadful snare is laid for virtuous innocence under a friend’s false pretense. Now, sir, on the whole let me tell you that those gentlemen, at least those that I can unite with, have no greater hope (besides that of an overruling Providence) than in the virtue and wisdom of your state together with that of Virginia and Massachusetts not adopting the new Constitution; and I have heard some of the first characters that composed our late Convention say that if nine states did adopt the Constitution and New York rejected it, they would remove into your state, where they could enjoy freedom and liberty, for which they had fought and bled heretofore. And if your state is not by that means one of the most populous, flourishing states on the continent, I am much mistaken, not by emigrants only that are or will be dissatisfied with the new Constitution from the different states, but also from Europe. I myself, if I am able to buy a small farm in your state (somewhere about the South Bay, Fair Haven, Crown Point, up the Mohawk River, German Flats, Fort Stanwix, Wood Creek, the Oneida Lake, Trois Rivieres on the Onondaga River, Schohary-skill, Bradstreets Island in Lake Ontario, in the mouth of the River St. Lawrence, Oswego only excepted, Niagara, and above all somewhere on the south banks of Lake Erie—most or all of those places I am acquainted with), and if the proposed Constitution takes place and Providence permits, I will with others remove into your state, provided you do not adopt it; for many of the Convention that attended it (for as I said before, I did not attend myself in person) told me that the Convention was one of the most overbearing assemblies that ever set in this state, and as the new Constitution gives all the power both of the sword and purse into the hands of the Congress, our people reckon it leads to and opens a door for despotism, tyranny, anarchy, and confusion, and every evil work. I am afraid, sir, for want of knowing whom to put confidence in, you (if you sent any) sent your books into the wrong hands, as they never appeared or could be seen except a few sent to General J[ames] W[adswor]th.8 I never could see one until a few days before our Convention sat. The rest, besides those sent as above, were all secreted, burnt, and distributed amongst those for the new Constitution in order to torture, [579]ridicule, and make shrewd remarks and may [make] game of, both of the pamphlet and them that wrote and sent them, all which they did not spare to do in our public newspapers by extracts and detached sentences just such as served their vile, malignant purposes long before I or any against the Constitution ever saw, I mean the Federal Farmer. On the whole, should be glad to know who those gentlemen are whom our heads of wit takes in hand to vilify in our public papers besides yourself. Pray, sir, who is Mr. Willet, Mr. Smith, Mr. Clinton, and Mr. Yates? Is Mr. Willet he that defended so nobly at Fort Stanwix in the late war? Also, who is Mr. Smith, and is Mr. Clinton your worthy governor—and pray who is Mr. Yates? Two of those names, viz., Judge Yates and Malankton Smith, Esquire, lodged at my house upwards of 20 days in December 1787 together with Mr. [James] Duane, your mayor, Chancellor [Robert R.] Livingston, Judge Herring [John Haring], Mr. [Egbert] Benson, your attorney general, and Mr. [Simeon] DeWitt, your surveyor general. [I] should be glad to know which or whether all or any of the above gentlemen are against or for the new proposed Constitution.9 Our 41 members of Convention that opposed the Constitution went home very heavy-hearted and discouraged to think that by one stroke they had lost all their liberty and privileges, both civil and sacred, as well as all their property, money, etc., etc., by a set of men whose aim is entirely popularity, as they think will please the bulk of the people and procure them places, salary, and pensions under the new Constitution, as I am informed that many who are now in office and who, it is said, were decidedly against it until they came to this town to Convention. Then they were told plainly that if they did not turn and vote for it, they must not expect any places either of trust or profit under the new Constitution. Thus this capital stroke was reserved for the finishing blow, as those concerned well knew the pulses of these sort of men, for—as one of your city said at the beginning of the late war, he then being on Long Island and settling some affairs from this state, that he could buy any councillor in this state for a half joe or a piece of Irish linen—there is nothing that works so effectually as interest. So it is well verified as to some of our great men in the present case, some of whom I believe I could call by name, but at present I’ll forbear, only that I will add one sentiment more and have done until I hear from New York, viz.: That I verily believe we have some of the most selfish, avaricious, narrow, contracted set of mortals that now exist in these thirteen disunited states. You’ll please to excuse some low, scurrilous, vulgar language [and] the want of diction and grammar, as I am not a man of a liberal education and only follow the plow, having no other [580]employ to get my bread but by the sweat of my brow, for I enjoy neither place nor pension, as they that are for the new Constitution in this state; and I am sure I shall never have any except I turn to their side, which at present I have no thoughts of. Sir, you’ll please to forgive this lengthy, unconnected scrawl, as it hastily flew from one of the pens of the family of the Wrongheads, so called by the Tory Roundheads. We this way fear this new Constitution will work much mischief before it is adopted, and the destruction and ruin of the thirteen states if it takes place. Please to give my compliments to all the before-named gentlemen and Hugh Hughes, Esquire, being one of the old committee, more especially to those that are decidedly against the new Constitution.10 P.S. Sir, General James Wadsworth is one of the many steeds that has behaved in character against the new Constitution and stood firm and intrepid, notwithstanding all the scoffs, flirts, browbeatings, flings, coughs, shuffles, threats, and menaces of the opposite faction in Convention. The sophistry, coloring, and smooth speeches of those great men which spoke last gave a turning cast to the whole and thereby gave the weaker brethren a different turn of mind from what they had when they came from home and or the instructions they received from the towns to which they belonged. But further, these forty-one good men in the minority say, in the name of common sense, why was the people in the different states so blind to their own interest as, at first, to choose and send to the General Convention at Philadelphia men then belonging to Congress; but more especially, afterwards, to send those very men to the state Convention to confirm their own dear acts and doings at Philadelphia. It is beyond all conceptions that wise men should act in this form as to send the very men whose interest it is to vote themselves places of honor and trust, profit, and money into their own pockets. Just so, things were managed at our late Convention in this town. The very men that framed the new Constitution at Philadelphia, together with our present governor, lieutenant governor, judges of our superior and inferior courts, present delegates to Congress, judges of probates, lawyers, tagrag and bobtail, with some reverend divines, and placemen, salarymen, sinecures, and expectants of every denomination whatsoever were the men chosen in this state to attend our Convention, and who voted to a man for the new Constitution. Only the honest forty-one, who enjoyed none of the above lucrative places, posts, or pensions, etc., etc., etc., and that stood free and unbiased in their minds and were the only honest disinterested men that voted in the negative. We this way hope that if a convention is formed in your state (which we hope will not be), that none of this sort of self-interested gentry may be chosen, which was evidently the case here, [581]which in the opinion of many honest, good, and disinterested men disaffected the honest, true, and simple desire of not only framing a good constitution at Philadelphia, but adopting the Constitution in our late Convention in this town. Now, sir, I don’t mean to be understood that there was not a number of worthy characters (provided they had been disinterested) that voted for the new Constitution. But, in the name of common sense, how can these men [be disinterested], who it is said has their chests and trunks, etc., filled with public securities bought up by their emissaries heretofore from 1/3 to 6/8 on the pound; and the moment the new Constitution takes place, they are all to be made good (as they imagine with interest from their date) and equal to gold and silver—so that the poor first proprietor will be obliged to work perhaps at hard labor to pay 20/. and the interest thereon for what he sold for 2/6.–in short, these and many other iniquituous practices that has been and now is carrying on by many of those great and mighty men that has heretofore made their jack out of flour, and beef, Long Island plunder, etc., etc. You’ll be so good as not to let anyone from this quarter see this letter and indeed no one except some select friends, and please [not?] to give or let anybody have or [see?] any copy, extracts, or detached sentences, as you may well learn the malevolent, vindictive tempers of some of these harpies, at least I have found it so against anyone that dare either write, speak, or act or even think against their new Dagon Constitution. Now, sir, as I told you before that you must not look for either diction, grammar, or even connection from a plowman; but this much I can say, that whatever inaccuracies or incoherence or sentiments thrown together, that they come from a staunch republican Whig who can trace his pedigree in that line much farther back than Charles the 2d even in Shropshire near Ludlow Castle, down to Henry the 2d and before, 14 miles above the city of Berwick on the banks of the Tweed. Adieu, my dear old friend and acquaintance. Please to write how and by whom you receive this and how the land lies in your state touching the new Constitution, etc., and what help we may depend on from the known virtue, wisdom, and good policy of your state in opposing the new Constitution. You may depend on it, you have many good and honest friends this way notwithstanding the many scurrilous, inflammatory pieces published of late in our partial public papers, for it is evident everything was published that was in favor of the new Constitution, but on the contrary, everything huggermuggered and suppressed that was truly alarming against it. I believe by this time I have tired your patience; therefore to make any further apology would be to add to the length of this long epistle, therefore [I] shall conclude. N.B. There is five gentlemen of the first characters on the continent that I formerly occasionally and now with some of them that are now living correspond with (viz.), Dr. [Benjamin] Franklin, Governor [William] Franklin,11 Governor [William] Livingston, now of the Jerseys, the Honorable William Smith12 and Sir Henry Moore,13 formerly of your city, Dr. [William Samuel] Johnson of this state, and the Honorable Samuel Adams14 of Boston, all of whom, the latter excepted, I fear are decidedly against me as to the new Constitution. What Governor Livingston’s opinion is I can never learn,15 as it is somewhat above two years since I received a letter from him on account of the commutation and Cincinnati affairs. I wish I could know what part he takes as touching the new Constitution. If I did, I would write him as well as my old friend Samuel Adams, who by the bye is on the right side of the question, and whose opinion in all cases of government, etc., especially when it coincides with my weak opinion, I value much. I wish you would write which side of the question Governor Livingston takes. Sir Henry Moore, William Smith, Esquire, Phillip Livingston,16 and William Livingston, esquires were formerly some of the greatest and best friends I ever had in America, but my old friend William Smith, Esquire, taking the wrong side of the question, from whom I had a letter some time since. I, from these connections and correspondents, heretofore received great satisfaction in both church and state, more especially from Governor Livingston when he occasionally corresponded with me when writing against the Bishop of Landaff, etc.17 Dr. Johnson, who is at present one of the best friends I have in this state, last May, before he went to the Convention at Philadelphia, was so kind as to spend part of two afternoons with me and now an evening the 5th instant. In May, we talked much of the intended Convention at Philadelphia. The other evening more particularly of the new Constitution; but, altho we differed widely in sentiments about and concerning the new Constitution and the doings of our then-present Convention, so far as they had then transpired, yet all these (as the old saying is) broke no squares in all our other politics or friendship. I have not seen or corresponded with my old friend Dr. Franklin since October 1775 then at Cambridge at General Washington’s house and at Roxbury—on turtle I had the pleasure of dining with him, the General, etc., etc., two days. This journey I made particularly by the Dr.’s desire when the Colonel Harison [Benjamin Harrison] and Mr. [Thomas] Lynche, [Sr.]18 went [as] a committee through this town from Congress to General Washington, etc., at Cambridge, except that I wrote the Dr. last May by Dr. Johnson.19"
