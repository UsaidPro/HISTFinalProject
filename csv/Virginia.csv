Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Elbridge Gerry,,,9/29/1787,"According to your request I now enclose you the Amendments that I proposed to the new Constitution. I incline to think, that unless some such alterations & provisions as those are interposed for the security of those essential rights of Mankind, without which liberty can not exist, we shall soon find that the New plan of Government will be far more inconvenient than any thing sustained under the present Government. And that to avoid Scilla we shall have fallen upon Caribdis."
Letter,Yes,Richard Henry Lee,George Mason,,,10/1/1787,"I have waited until now to answer your favor of September 18th10 from Philadelphia, that I might inform you how the Convention plan of government was entertained by Congress. Your prediction of what would happen in Congress was exactly verified. It was with us, as with you, this or nothing; and this urged with a most extreme intemperance. The greatness of the powers given and the multitude of places to be created produces a coalition of monarchy men, military men, aristocrats, and drones whose noise, impudence and zeal exceeds all belief—whilst the commercial plunder of the South stimulates the rapacious trader. In this state of things, the patriot voice is raised in vain for such changes and securities as reason and experience prove to be necessary against the encroachments of power upon the indispensable rights of human nature. Upon due consideration of the Constitution under which we now act, some of us were clearly of opinion that the 13th Article of the Confederation precluded us from giving an opinion concerning a plan subversive of the present system and eventually forming a new confederacy of nine instead of 13 states. The contrary doctrine was asserted with great violence in expectation of the strong majority with which they might send it forward under terms of much approbation. Having procured an opinion that Congress was qualified to consider, to amend, to approve or disapprove, the next game was to determine that tho a right to amend existed, it would be highly inexpedient to exercise that right; but merely to transmit it with respectful marks of approbation. In this state of things I availed myself of the right to amend and moved the amendments, a copy of which I send herewith, and called the ayes and nays to fix them on the Journal. This greatly alarmed the majority and vexed them extremely, for the plan is to push the business on with great dispatch and with as little opposition as possible; that it may be adopted before it has stood the test of reflection and due examination. They found it most eligible at last to transmit it merely, without approving or disapproving; provided nothing but the transmission should appear on the Journal. This compromise was settled and they took the opportunity of inserting the word “unanimously,” which applied only to simple transmission, hoping to have it mistaken for an unanimous approbation of the thing. It states that Congress having received the Constitution unanimously transmit it, etc. It is certain that no approbation was given."
Letter,Yes,Richard Henry Lee,William Shippen Jr.,,,10/2/1787,"I have considered the new Constitution with all the attention and candor that the thing and the times render necessary, and I find it impossible for me to doubt, that in its present state, unamended, the adoption of it will put civil liberty and the happiness of the people at the mercy of rulers who may possess the great unguarded powers given. And I assure you that confidence in the moderation or benignity of power is not a plant of quick growth in a reflecting bosom. The necessary alterations will by no means interfere with the general nature of the plan, or limit the power of doing good; but they will restrain from oppression the wicked and tyrannic. If all men were wise and good there would be no necessity for government or law. But the folly and the vice of human nature renders government and laws necessary for the many, and restraints indispensable to prevent oppression from those who are entrusted with the administration of one and the dispensation of the other. You will see herewith the amendments that appeared to me necessary.12 They are submitted to you and my excellent old friend at Germantown. Perhaps they may be submitted to the world at large. My good old friend has made himself better acquainted with Hippocrates than with Plato, and relying upon the goodness of his own heart, without reflecting upon the corrupting and encroaching nature of power, he is willing to trust to its fangs more than experience justifies. The malady of human nature in these states now seems to be as it was in the years of 1778 and 1779 with respect to the effect produced by a certain combination. The malady that I mean is a temporary insanity. I wish that the present may subside with as little public injury as it formerly did, altho that was not small in all its branches."
Letter,No,Arthur Lee,John Adams,,,10/3/1787,"I enclose you the long expected production of the Convention. I am inclind to think you will deem it somewhat too Aristocratic. An Oligarchy however I think will spring from it in the persons of the President & Vice President, who, if they understand one another, will easily govern the two Houses to their will. The omission of a Declaration of rights—the appointment of a vice President, whose sole business seems to be to intrigue—securing trial by Jury in criminal cases only—making the federal Court original instead of appellent, & that in the case of a Citisen of any State & one of another, & of a foreigner with the citisen of any State—the omission of a Council—& vesting legislative, executive & judicial Powers in the Senate—the making this Senate Counsellors to the President, & Judges on his impeachement which may happen to be for the very thing they have advisd—are errors, if errors, gross as a Mountain. I say if errors, for I am very much inclined to beleive they were designd. Congress, having three States represented by those who were members of Convention & three of the most influential each in three other States, resolvd to send it on without any recommendation, because its opponents insisted upon having their reasons on the Journals if they offerd to recommend it. The States present were—N.H. 2 Convention men—Mass: 2 Convention, one not. Connecticut one Convention one not. N.Y—N Jersey—Pens:—Delaware—Virg: 1 Convention 3 not—N. Car: one Convention one not—S.C. one Conv: 2 not. Georgia 2 Convention. Pensylvania has orderd the State Convention to meet on the 3d Novr. to determine on its adoption. All the other Assemblies will direct Conventions when they meet. From the present appearance of things, it seems probable it will become our Constitution just as is. No opposition is declard to it, but in Virginia where it will be opposd, I imagine by the Govr. R. H. Lee, Mr. Mason & Mr. Henry: & In this State, the Governor2 & all his friends are in opposition. I wish it may be amended & cannot see why it shoud not. My Br. R. H. Lee is here & desires to be affectionately rememberd [35]to you. Please to remember me to Mrs. Adams, Mr. & Mrs. [William Stephens] Smith & to my nephew [Thomas Lee Shippen], to whom I have not time to write."
Letter,No,Benjamin Harrison,George Washington,,,10/4/1787,"Your favor of the 28th ulto2 got to me two days ago: I am particularly oblig’d to you for this additional mark of your friendship, and attention, than which, there are very few things indeed, that can be more acceptable; I feel myself deeply interested in every thing that you have had a hand in, or that comes from you and am so well assured of the solidity of your judgment, and the rectitude of your intentions, that I shall never stick at trifles to conform myself to your opinions; in the present instance, I am so totally uninform’d as to the general situation of America, that I can form no judgment of the necessity the convention was under to give us such a constitution as it has done; If our condition is not very desperate, I have my fears that the remedy will [36]prove worse than the disease. Age makes men often over cautious; I am willing to attribute my fears to that cause, but from whatever source they spring, I can not divest myself of an opinion, that the seeds of civil discord are plentifully sown, in very many of the powers given both to the president and congress, and that if the constitution is carried in to effect, the States south of potowmac, will be little more than appendages to those to the northward of it. You will say that general charges, are things without force, they are so, but in the present instance, I do not withhold particular observations, because I want them, but that I would not tire your patience, by entering deeply into a subject, before I had heard the reasons which operated in favor of the measures taken. After the meeting of the assembly3 and hearing from those who had a hand in the work, the reasons that operated with them, in favor of their measures, I will then more at length give you my sentiments, in the interim, I shall only say, that my objections chiefly lay, agst. the unlimited powers of taxation, and the regulations of trade, and the jurisdictions that are to be established in every State, altogether independent of their laws. The sword, and such powers will; nay in the nature of things they must sooner or later, establish a tyrany, not inferiour to the triumvirate, or centum viri of Room [Rome]. But enough of this, till another opportunity, in the mean time I have only to add, that I am with the most unfeigned attachment, and perfect esteem"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Samuel Adams,,,10/5/1787,"Having long toiled with you my dear friend in the Vineyard of liberty, I do with great pleasure submit to your wisdom and patriotism, the objections that prevail in my mind against the new Constitution proposed for federal government—Which objections I did propose to Congress in form of amendments to be discussed, and that such as were approved might be forwarded to the States with the Convention system. You will have been informed by other hands why these amendments were not considered and do not appear on the Journal, and the reasons that influenced a bare transmission of the Convention plan, without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation on the part of Congress.2 I [37]suppose my dear Sir, that the good people of the U. States in their late generous contest, contended for free government in the fullest, clearest, and strongest sense. That they had no idea of being brought under despotic rule under the notion of “Strong government,” or in form of elective despotism: Chains being still Chains, whether made of gold or of iron. The corrupting nature of power, and its insatiable appetite for increase, hath proved the necessity, and procured the adoption of the strongest and most express declarations of that Residuum of natural rights, which is not intended to be given up to Society; and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose. In a government therefore, where the power of judging what shall be for the general wellfare, which goes to every object of human legislation; and where the laws of such Judges shall be the supreme Law of the Land: it seems to be of the last consequence to declare in most explicit terms the reservations above alluded to. So much for the propriety of a Bill of Rights as a necessary bottom to this new system—It is in vain to say that the defects in this new Constitution may be remedied by the Legislature created by it. The remedy, as it may, as it may not be applied—And if it should, a subsequent Assembly may repeal the Acts of its predecessor for the parliamentary doctrine is ‘quod legis posteriores priores contrarias abrogant’ 4 Inst. 43.3 Surely this is not a ground upon which a wise and good man would choose to rest the dearest rights of human nature—Indeed, some capital defects are not within the compass of legislative redress—The Oligarchic tendency from the combination of President, V. President, & Senate, is a ruin not within legislative remedy. Nor is the partial right of voting in the Senate, or the defective numbers in the house of Representatives. It is of little consequence to say that the numbers in the last mentioned Assembly will increase with the population of these States, because what may happen in twenty five or 27 years hence is poor alleviation of evil, that the intermediate time is big with; for it often happens that abuse under the name of Use is rivetted upon Mankind. Nor can a good reason be assigned for establishing a bad, instead of a good government, in the first instance; because time may amend the bad-Men do not choose to be sick because it may happen that physic may cure them—Suppose that good men came first to the administration of this government; and that they should see, or think they see, a necessity for trying criminally a Man without giving him his Jury of the Vicinage; or that the freedom of the Press should be restrained because it disturbed the operations of the new government—the mutilation of the jury trial, and the restraint of the Press would then [38]follow for good purposes as it should seem, and by good men—But these precedents will be followed by bad men to sacrifice honest and innocent men; and to suppress the exertions of the Press for wicked and tyrannic purposes—it being certainly true that ‘Omnia mala exempla ex bonis orta sunt: sed ubi imperium ad ignaros aut minus bonos pervinit, novum illud exemplum ab dignis et idoneis ad indignos et non idoneous fertur.’4 In proof of this, we know that the wise and good Lord Holt, to support King William and Revolution principles, produced doctrines in a case of Libel (King against Bear) subversive both of law and sound sense; which his Successor Lord Mannsfield (in the case of Woodfall) would have availed himself of for the restraint of the Press and the ruin of liberty.5 It would appear therefore, that the consideration of human perversity renders it necessary for human safety, that in the first place, power not requisite should not be given, and in the next place that necessary powers should be carefully guarded. How far this is done in the New Constitution I submit to your wise and attentive consideration. Whether, for the present, it may not be sufficient so to alter the Confederation as to allow Congress full liberty to make Treaties by removing the restraining clauses;6 by giving the Impost for a limited time, and the power of Regulating trade; is a question that deserves to be considered. But I think the new Constitution (properly amended) as it contains many good regulations, may be admitted—And why may not such indispensable amendments be proposed by the Conventions and returned With the new plan to Congress that a new general Convention may so weave them into the proffer’d system as that a Web may be produced fit for freemen to wear? If such amendments were proposed by a Capital state or two, & a willingness expressed to agree with the plan so amended; I cannot see why it may not be effected. It is a mere begging the question to suppose, as some do, that only this Moment and this Measure will do—But why so, there being no war external or internal to prevent due deliberation on this most momentous business—The public papers will inform you what violence has been practised by the Agitators of this new System in Philadelphia to drive on its immediate adoption—As if the subject of Government were a business of passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration.7 I shall not leave this place before the 4th of November—in the mean time I shall be happy to hear from you—My best compliments are presented to Mrs. Adams, and I pray to be remembered to Gen. [James] Warren, Mr. [James] Lovell & the good Doctor [Samuel] Holten when you see him."
Letter,No,George Mason,George Washington,,,10/7/1787,"I got very much hurt in my Neck & Head, by the unlucky Accident on the Road; it is now wearing off; tho’ at times still uneasy to me.2— I take the Liberty to enclose You my Objections to the new Constitution of Government; which a little Moderation & Temper, in the latter End of the Convention, might have removed. I am however most decidedly of Opinion, that it ought to be submitted to a Convention chosen by the People, for that special Purpose; and should any Attempt be made to prevent the calling such a Convention here, such a Measure shall have every Opposition in my Power to give it3—You will readily observe, that my Objections are not numerous (the greater Part of the inclosed paper containing Reasonings upon the probable Effects of the exceptionable Parts) tho’ in my Mind, some of them are capital ones.— There is no Declaration of Rights; and the Laws of the general Government being paramount to the Laws & Constitutions of the several States, the Declarations of Rights in the separate States are no Security. Nor are the People secured even in the Enjoyment of the Benefits of the common-Law; (which stands here upon no other Foundation than it’s having been adopted by the respective Acts forming the Constitutions of the several States.—) In the House of Representatives there is not the Substance, but the Shadow only of Representation; which can never produce proper Information in the Legislature, or inspire Confidence in the People: the Laws will therefore be generally made by Men little concern’d in, and unacquainted with their Effects & Consequences.—(a) The Senate have the Power of altering all Money-Bills, and of originating Appropriations of Money, & the sallerys of the Officers of their own Appointment in Conjunction with the President of the United States; altho’ they are not the Representatives of the People, or amenable to them.— These with their other great Powers (vizt. their Power in the Appointment of Ambassadors & all public Officers, in making Treaties, & in trying all Impeachments) their Influence upon & Connection with the supreme Executive from these Causes, their Duration of Office, and their being a constant existing Body almost continually sitting, [44]join’d with their being one compleat Branch of the Legislature, will destroy any Balance in the Government, and enable them to accomplish what Usurpations they please upon the Rights & Libertys of the People.— The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed & extended, as to absorb & destroy the Judiciarys of the several States; thereby rendering Law as tedious intricate & expensive, and Justice as unattainable, by a great Part of the Community, as in England, and enabling the Rich to oppress & ruin the Poor.— The President of the United States has no constitutional Council (a thing unknown in any safe & regular Government) he will therefore be unsupported by proper Information & Advice; and will generally be directed by Minions & Favourites—or He will become a Tool to the Senate—or a Council of State will grow out of the principal Officers of the great Departments; the worst & most dangerous of all Ingredients for such a Council, in a free Country; <for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive Measures, to shelter themselves and prevent an Inquiry into their own Misconduct in Office; whereas had a constitutional Council been formed (as was proposed) of six Members; vizt. two from the Eastern, two from the Middle, and two from the Southern States, to be appointed by Vote of the States in the House of Representatives, with the same Duration & Rotation of Office as the Senate, the Executive would always have had safe & proper Information & Advice, the President of such a Council might have acted as Vice President of the United States, pro tempore, upon any Vacancy or Disability of the chief Magistrate; and long continued Sessions of the Senate would in a great Measure have been prevented.—> From this fatal Defect of a constitutional Council has arisen the improper Power of the Senate, in the Appointment of public Officers, and the alarming Dependence & Connection between that Branch of the Legislature, and the supreme Executive.—Hence also sprung that unnecessary & dangerous Officer the Vice President; who for want of other Employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously blending the executive & legislative Powers; besides always giving to some one of the States an unnecessary & unjust Pre-eminence over the others.— The President of the United States has the unrestrained Power of granting Pardons for Treason; which may be sometimes excercised to screen from Punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the Crime, & thereby prevent a Discovery of his own Guilt.— By declaring all Treaties supreme Laws of the Land, the Executive [45]& the Senate have, in many Cases, an exclusive Power of Legislation; which might have been avoided, by proper Distinctions with Respect to Treaties, and requiring the Assent of the House of Representatives, where it could be done with Safety.— By requiring only a Majority to make all Commercial & Navigation Laws, the five Southern States (whose Produce & Circumstances are totally different from that of the eight Northern & Eastern States) will be ruined; for such rigid & premature Regulations may be made as will enable the Merchants of the Northern & Eastern States not only to demand an exorbitant Freight, but to monopolize the Purchase of the Commodities at their own Price, for many Years: to the great Injury of the landed Interest, & Impoverishment of the People: and the Danger is the greater, as the Gain on one Side will be in Proportion to the Loss on the other. Whereas requiring two thirds of the Members present in both Houses would have produced mutual Moderation, promoted the general Interest, and removed an insuperable Objection to the Adoption of the Government.— Under their own Construction of the general Clause at the End of the enumerated Powers, the Congress may grant Monopolies in Trade & Commerce, constitute new Crimes, inflict unusual & severe Punishments, and extend their Power as far as they shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no Security for the Powers now presumed to remain to them; or the People for their Rights.— There is no Declaration of any kind for preserving the Liberty of the Press, the Tryal by jury in civil Causes; nor against the Danger of standing Armys in time of Peace. The State Legislatures are restrained from laying Export-Duties on their own Produce.— The general Legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further Importation of Slaves for twenty odd Years; tho’ such Importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable, and less capable of Defence.— Both the general Legislature & the State Legislatures are expressly prohibited making ex post facto Laws; tho’ there never was or can be a Legislature but must & will make such Laws, when Necessity & the public Safety require them; which will hereafter be a Breach of all the Constitutions in the Union, and afford Precedents for other Innovations.— This Government will commence in a moderate Aristocracy; it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in it’s Operation, produce a Monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive Aristocracy; it will most probably [46]vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other.— (a)This Objection has been in some Degree lessened by an Amendment, often before refused, and at last made by an Erasure, after the Engrossment upon Parchment, of the word forty, and inserting thirty, in the 3d. Clause of the 2d. Section of the 1st. Article.—"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,George Washington,,,10/11/1787,"It is under the strongest impressions of your goodness and candor, that I venture to make the observations that follow in this letter, assuring you that I feel it among the first distresses that have happened to me in my life, that I find myself compelled by irresistible conviction of mind to doubt about the new System for federal government recommended by the late Convention. It is Sir, in consequence of long reflection upon the nature of Man and of government, that I am led to fear the danger that will ensue to Civil Liberty, from the adoption of the new system in its present form. I am fully sensible of the propriety of change in the present plan of confederation, and altho there may be difficulties, not inconsiderable, in procuring an adoption of such amendments to the Convention System as will give security to the just rights of human nature, and better secure from injury the discordant interests of the different parts of this Union; yet I hope that these difficulties are not insurmountable. Because we are happily uninterrupted by external war, or by such internal discords as can prevent peaceable and fair discussion, in another Convention, of those objections that are fundamentally strong against the new Constitution, which abounds with useful regulations. As there is so great a part of the business well done already, I think that such alterations as must give very general content, could not long employ another Convention when provided with the sense of the different States upon those alterations. I am much inclined to believe that the amendments generally thought to be necessary, will be found to be of such a nature, as tho they do not oppose the exercise of a very competent federal power; are yet such as the best Theories on Government and the best practise upon those theories have found necessary. At the same time that they are [52]such as the opinions of our people have for ages been fixed on. It would be unnecessary for me here to enumerate particulars as I expect the honor of waiting on you at Mount Vernon in my way home early in November.2"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Edmund Randolph,,,10/16/1787,"Dear Sir, I was duly honored with your favor of September 17th,1 from Philadelphia, which should have been acknowledged long before now, if the nature of the business that it related to had not required time. The establishment of the new plan of government, in its present form, is a question that involves such immense consequences to the present times and to posterity, that it calls for the deepest attention of the best and wisest friends of their country and of mankind. If it be found good after mature deliberation, adopt it, if wrong, amend it at all events, for to say (as many do) that a bad government must be established for fear of anarchy, is really saying that we must kill ourselves for fear of dying. Experience and the actual state of things, shew that there is no difficulty in procuring a general convention; the late one being collected without any obstruction: Nor does external war, or internal discord prevent the most cool, collected, full, and fair discussion of this all-important subject. If with infinite ease, a convention was obtained to prepare a system, why may not another with equal ease be procured to make proper and necessary amendments? Good government is not the work of a short time, or of sudden thought. From Moses to Montesquieu the greatest geniuses have been employed on this difficult subject, and yet experience has shewn capital defects in the system produced for the government of mankind. But since it is neither prudent or easy to make frequent changes in government, and as bad governments have been generally found the most fixed; so it becomes of the last consequence to frame the first establishment upon ground the most unexceptionable, and such as the best theories with experience justify; not trusting as our new constitution does, and as many approve of doing, to time and future events to correct errors, that both reason and experience in similar cases, point out in the new system. It has hitherto been supposed a fundamental maxim that in governments rightly balanced, the different branches of legislature should be unconnected, and that the legislative and executive powers should be separate:—In the new constitution, the president and senate have all the executive and two thirds of the legislative power. In some weighty instances (as making all kinds of treaties which are to be the laws of the land) they have the whole legislative and executive powers. They jointly, appoint all officers civil and military, and they (the senate) [62]try all impeachments either of their own members, or of the officers appointed by themselves. Is there not a most formidable combination of power thus created in a few, and can the most critic eye, if a candid one, discover responsibility in this potent corps? Or will any sensible man say, that great power without responsibility can be given to rulers with safety to liberty? It is most clear that the parade of impeachment is nothing to them or any of them—as little restraint is to be found, I presume from the fear of offending constituents.—The president is for four years duration (and Virginia for example) has one vote of thirteen in the choice of him, and this thirteenth vote not of the people, but electors, two removes from the people. The senate is a body of six years duration, and as in the choice of president, the largest state has but a thirteenth vote, so is it in the choice of senators.—This latter statement is adduced to shew that responsibility is as little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from the terror of impeachment. You are, therefore, Sir, well warranted in saying, either a monarchy or aristocracy will be generated, perhaps the most grievous system of government may arise. It cannot be denied with truth, that this new constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously oligarchic; and it is a point agreed that a government of the few, is, of all governments, the worst. The only check to be found in favor of the democratic principle in this system is, the house of representatives; which I believe may justly be called a mere shread or rag of representation: It being obvious to the least examination, that smallness of number and great comparative disparity of power, renders that house of little effect to promote good, or restrain bad government. But what is the power given to this ill constructed body? To judge of what may be for the general welfare, and such judgments when made, the acts of Congress become the supreme laws of the land. This seems a power co-extensive with every possible object of human legislation.—Yet there is no restraint in form of a bill of rights, to secure (what Doctor Blackstone calls) that residuum of human rights, which is not intended to be given up to society, and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose.2—The rights of conscience, the freedom of the press, and the trial by jury are at mercy. It is there stated, that in criminal cases, the trial shall be by jury. But how? In the state. What then becomes of the jury of the vicinage or at least from the county in the first instance, for the states being from 50 to 700 miles in extent? This mode of trial even in criminal cases may be greatly impaired, and in civil causes the inference is strong, that it may be altogether omitted as the constitution positively assumes it in criminal, [63]and is silent about it in civil causes.—Nay, it is more strongly discountenanced in civil cases by giving the supreme court in appeals, jurisdiction both as to law and fact. Judge Blackstone in his learned commentaries, art. jury trial, says, it is the most transcendant privilege which any subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, his person, but by the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals.3 A constitution that I may venture to affirm has under providence, secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages.—The impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society. But if that be entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince, or such as enjoy the highest offices of the state, these decisions in spite of their own natural integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity. It is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should always be attentive to the good of the many. The learned judge further says, that every tribunal selected for the decision of facts, is a step towards establishing aristocracy; the most oppressive of all governments.4 The answer to these objections is, that the new legislature may provide remedies!—But as they may, so they may not, and if they did, a succeeding assembly may repeal the provisions.—The evil is found resting upon constitutional bottom, and the remedy upon the mutable ground of legislation, revocable at any annual meeting. It is the more unfortunate that this great security of human rights, the trial by jury, should be weakened in this system, as power is unnecessarily given in the second section of the third article, to call people from their own country in all cases of controversy about property between citizens of different states and foreigners, with citizens of the United States, to be tried in a distant court where the Congress may sit. For although inferior congressional courts may for the above purposes be instituted in the different states, yet this is a matter altogether in the pleasure of the new legislature, so that if they please not to institute them, or if they do not regulate the right of appeal reasonably, the people will be exposed to endless oppression, and the necessity of submitting in multitudes of cases, to pay unjust demands, rather than follow suitors, through great expence, to far distant tribunals, and to be determined upon there, as it may be, without a jury.—In this congressional legislature, a bare majority of votes can enact commercial laws, so that the representatives of the seven northern states, as they will have a majority, can by law create the most oppressive monopoly upon the five southern states, whose circumstances and productions are essentially different from theirs, [64]although not a single man of these voters are the representatives of, or amenable to the people of the southern states. Can such a set of men be, with the least colour of truth called a representative of those they make laws for? It is supposed that the policy of the northern states will prevent such abuses. But how feeble, Sir, is policy when opposed to interest among trading people:—And what is the restraint arising from policy? Why that we may be forced by abuse to become ship-builders!—But how long will it be before a people of agriculture can produce ships sufficient to export such bulky commodities as ours, and of such extent; and if we had the ships, from whence are the seamen to come? 4000 of whom at least will be necessary in Virginia. In questions so liable to abuse, why was not the necessary vote put to two thirds of the members of the legislature? With the constitution came from the convention, so many members of that body to Congress, and of those too, who were among the most fiery zealots for their system, that the votes of three states being of them, two states divided by them, and many others mixed with them, it is easy to see that Congress could have little opinion upon the subject.5 Some denied our right to make amendments, whilst others more moderate agreed to the right, but denied the expediency of amending; but it was plain that a majority was ready to send it on in terms of approbation—my judgment and conscience forbid the last, and therefore I moved the amendments that I have the honor to send you inclosed herewith, and demanded the yeas and nays that they might appear on the journal. This seemed to alarm and to prevent such appearance on the journal, it was agreed to transmit the constitution without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation; so that the term unanimously only applied to the transmission, as you will observe by attending to the terms of the resolve for transmitting.6 Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that as this constitution abounds with useful regulations, at the same time that it is liable to strong and fundamental objections, the plan for us to pursue, will be to propose the necessary amendments, and express our willingness to adopt it with the amendments, and to suggest the calling of a new convention for the purpose of considering them. To this I see no well founded objection, but great safety and much good to be the probable result. I am perfectly satisfied that you make such use of this letter as you shall think to be for the public good; and now after begging your pardon for so great a trespass on your patience, and presenting my best respects to your lady, I will conclude with assuring you, that I am with the sincerest esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most affectionate and obedient servant, RICHARD HENRY LEE."
Broadside,No,Richard Henry Lee,,,,10/16/1787,"It having been found from universal experience, that the most express declarations and reservations are necessary to protect the just rights and liberty of mankind from the silent, powerful and ever active conspiracy of those who govern; and it appearing to be the sense of the good people of America, by the various bills or declarations of rights whereon the government of the greater number of states are founded. That such precautions are necessary to restrain and regulate the exercise of the great powers given to rulers. In conformity with these principles, and from respect for the public sentiment on this subject, it is submitted,—That the new constitution proposed for the government of the United States be bottomed upon a declaration or bill of rights, clearly and precisely stating the principles upon which this social compact is founded, to wit: That the rights of conscience in matters of religion ought not to be violated—That the freedom of the press shall be secured—That the trial by jury in criminal and civil cases, and the modes prescribed by the common law for the safety of life in criminal prosecutions, shall be held sacred—That standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted, unless assented to by two-thirds of the members composing each house of the legislature under the new constitution—That the elections should be free and frequent; That the right administration of justice should be secured by the independency of the judges; That excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments, should not be demanded or inflicted; That the right of the people to assemble peaceably, for the purpose of petitioning the legislature, shall not be prevented; that the citizens shall not be exposed to unreasonable searches, seizure of their persons, houses, papers or property; and it is necessary for the good of society, that the administration of government be conducted with all possible maturity of judgment, for which reason it hath been the practice of civilized nations, and so determined by every state in the Union: That a council of state or privy council should be appointed to advise and assist in the arduous business assigned to the executive power. Therefore let the new constitution be so amended, as to admit the appointment of a privy council, to consist of eleven members chosen by the president, but responsible for the advice they may give. For which purpose the advice given shall be entered in a council book, and signed by the giver, in all affairs of great moment, and that the counsellors act under an oath of office. In order to prevent the dangerous blending of the legislative and executive powers, and to secure responsibility, the privy, and not the [66]senate shall be joined with the president in the appointment of all officers, civil and military, under the new constitution; that the constitution be so altered as not to admit the creation of a vice-president, when duties as assigned may be discharged by the privy council, except in the instance of proceeding in the senate, which may be supplied by a speaker chosen from the body of senators by themselves, as usual, that so may be avoided the establishment of a great officer of state, who is sometimes to be joined with the legislature, and sometimes to administer the government, rendering responsibility difficult,8 besides giving unjust and needless pre-eminence to that state from whence this officer may have come. That such parts of the new constitution be amended as provide imperfectly for the trial of criminals by a jury of the vicinage, and to supply the omission of a jury trial in civil causes or disputes about property between individuals, whereby the common law is directed, and as generally it is secured by the several state constitutions. That such parts of the new constitution be amended, as permit the vexatious and oppressive callings of citizens from their own country, and all controversies between citizens of different states and between citizens and foreigners, to be tried in a far distant court, and as it may be without a jury, whereby in a multitude of cases, the circumstances of distance and expence may compel numbers to submit to the most unjust and ill-founded demand—That in order to secure the rights of the people more effectually from violation, the power and respectability of the house of representatives be increased, by increasing the number of delegates to that house, where the popular interest must chiefly depend for protection—That the constitution be so amended as to increase the number of votes necessary to determine questions in cases where a bare majority may be seduced by strong motives of interest to injure and oppress the minority of the community, as in commercial regulations, where advantage may be taken of circumstances to ordain rigid and premature laws, that will in effect amount to monopolies, to the great impoverishment of those states whose peculiar situation expose them to such injuries"
Newspaper,No,Cato Uticensis,,Independent Chronicle,,10/17/1787,"To the FREEMEN of Virginia. Adventuring, this day, to call your attention to one of the most serious and awful subjects, that ever was agitated by a free people, I must, in the most unfeigned manner, supplicate your kindest indulgence. I must, (it would be presumption to deny it) own that the head which dictates these words, and the hand, which guides this pen, trembles at this moment with reverential awe; and, if I mistake not, there [71]are few among you,2 whose own feelings will leave any room to doubt it, when you are informed, that I am summing up the courage to question the merits of the Federal Constitution, proposed to your consideration by the late General Convention. In the hour of distress, in the moment of confusion and perilous danger, after separately declaring themselves sovereign and independent, the Thirteen States of America associated together in a Federal league, for their common defense, an affair of such magnitude, formed under the influence of such unfavorable circumstances, could not fail of receiving a tinge from them; consequently, when the war, that link, which supplied each defect was over, the yawning and the chasms of the building began to give evident marks of the hastiness of the workmen: America saw, that without the help of a better cement, the different members were likely to fall asunder, and that, though we may find a lodging in some of the separated pavilions, we must bid adieu to the grandeur and dignity of being inhabitants of a stately palace. The State of Virginia had the honor of taking the lead in this business, and well aware of its magnitude and import, she delegated some of her choicest sons to it, as did the other States, the result has been anxiously waited for, and in the confidence of its being the offspring of the combined abilities and integrity of America, nobody doubted discovering in it the characteristic features of the parents. The reverence, which every man must feel for them, made me, on examining it, guard against my own opinion with the utmost severity. But, as it is not in the power of man to give up, in any single instance, the dictates of his reason, when he has once been convinced of the propriety of allowing his judgment to be swayed by no other motive, I thought it beneath the dignity of a free agent, with strength of conviction on my mind, to sacrifice it to any authority or predilection whatsoever. To acquire this conviction, ’tis true, I had no small difficulty to bring myself to examine the Federal Constitution abstracting from its authors; I hope, nevertheless, that every freeman in Virginia will, in this momentous matter, take the same method, will nobly dare to think for himself, and will not be lulled, perhaps into a fatal stupor, by the whistling of any names whatsoever; this, I am sure, is the wish of the most exalted characters, that formed the Federal Convention; and, believe me, when you will not use this privilege, you are no longer worthy to bear the name of freemen. I would wish to find it sunk deep into your recollection, and be early impressed upon the minds of your children, that all the republics, which were, and are not, in the world, owed their loss of liberty and their dissolution, to an over-weaning reverence for men and their measures. This consideration [72]is not thrown out to you, with the impious arrogance of insinuating the least doubt of the upright and patriotic views, of the Delegates who formed the late General Convention; a vain and presumptuous attempt of that kind would, undoubtedly, have no other effect with you, than that of branding the man, who could be guilty of it, with the most deserved infamy and contempt. The intention of it is, to induce you, as it behooves freemen, to meet the consideration of this matter, with minds purged of all kind of prejudice, and ready to yield to the conviction of your reason—Humanum est errare. The lot of human nature renders it liable to error, and, if we discover it here, it will be a great practical lesson, to humble ourselves before the fountain of ALL WISDOM. Though I have not the fondness to think, that any remarks of mine shall influence the political conduct of any one, I may, perhaps without incurring the imputation of self-sufficiency, indulge myself with the hopes, that they may call forth some abler pens to agitate this matter. It is surely to be wished, that the attention of the Citizens of the different States should be fixed, in a cool, dispassionate manner, to a subject, which is to have so direct an influence on the future prosperity of them and their posterity. It has been the language, since the peace, of the most virtuous and discerning men in America, that the powers vested in Congress were inadequate to the procuring of the benefits, that should result from the union: It was found, that our national character was sinking in the opinion of foreign nations, and, that the selfish views of some of the States were likely to become the source of dangerous jealousy; the requisitions of Congress were set at naught; the Government, that represented the Union, had not a shilling in its Treasury to enable it to pay off the Federal debts, nor, had it any method within its power to alter its situation; it could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the observance of them, and it was felt, that we were suffering from the restrictions of foreign nations, who seeing the want of energy in our Federal Constitution, and the unlikelihood of co-operation in thirteen separate Legislatures, had shackled our commerce, without any dread of recrimination on our part: To obviate these grievances, it was, I believe, the general opinion, that new powers should be vested in Congress, to enable it, in the amplest manner, to regulate the commerce, to lay and collect duties on the imports, of the United States. Delegates were appointed by most of them, for these purposes, to a Convention, to be held at Annapolis in the September before last; a few of them met, and without waiting for the others, who were coming on, they dissolved the Convention, after resolving among themselves, that the powers vested in them were not sufficiently [73]extensive, and, that they would apply to the Legislatures of the several States, which they represented, to appoint members to another Convention, with powers to new model the Federal Constitution. This, indeed, it has now done in the most unequivocal manner, nor has it stopped here, for it has fairly annihilated the Constitution of each individual state. It has proposed to you a high prerogative government, which, like Aron’s serpent, is to swallow up the rest:3 this is what the thinking people in America were apprehensive of; they knew how difficult it is to hit the golden mean, how natural the transition is from one extreme to the other; from anarchy to tyranny; from the inconvenient laxity of thirteen separate Governments to the too sharp and grinding one, before which our sovereignty, as a state, was to vanish. In Art. 1, Sect. 8. of the proposed Federal Constitution; it is said, “Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.”—Are you then, Virginians, about to abandon your country to the depredations of excisemen, and the pressure of excise laws? Did it ever enter the mind of any one of you, that you could live to see the day, that any other government, but the General Assembly of Virginia, should have power of direct taxation in this state? How few of you ever expected to see excise laws, the instruments of tyranny, in force in your country? But who could imagine that any man but a Virginian, were they found to be necessary, would ever have a voice towards enacting them? That any tribunal, but the Courts of Virginia, would be allowed to take cognizance of disputes between her citizens and their tax-gatherers and their excisemen? And that, if it should ever be found necessary to curse this land with these hateful excisemen, anyone, but a fellow citizen, should be entrusted with that office? For my part, I cannot discover the necessity there was of allowing Congress to subject us to excise laws, unless, that considering the extensiveness of the single republic into which this Constitution would collect all the others, and the well-known difficulty of governing large republics with harmony and ease, it was thought expedient to bit our mouths with massive curbs, to break us, bridled with excise laws, and managed by excisemen, into an uniform, sober pace, and thus, gradually, tame the troublesome mettle of the freeman. This necessity could not, surely, arise from the desire of furnishing Congress with a sufficient revenue, to enable it to exercise the prerogatives, which every friend to America would wish to see vested in it; as it would, by unanimous consent, have the management of the impost, it could increase it to any amount, and this would fall sufficiently uniform on every one, according to his ability; or, were this not found sufficient, could not the deficiency be made up by requisitions to the states? Could it not [74]have been made an article of the Federal Constitution, that, if any of them refused their quota, Congress may be allowed to make it up by an increase of the impost, on that particular state so refusing. This would, surely, be a sufficient security to Congress, that their requisitions would be punctually complied with. In any dispute between you and the revenue officers and excisemen of Congress, it is true, that it is provided, the trial shall be, in the first instance, within the state, though before a Federal tribunal: It is said in par. 3. sect. 2. art. 3, “The trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachments shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the crimes shall be committed;” but what does this avail, when an appeal will lie against you to the Supreme Federal Court—In the paragraph preceding the one just now quoted, it is said, “In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned,(a) the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.” But where is this Supreme Court to sit? Will it not be, where Congress shall fix its residence? Thither then you will be carried for trial. Who are to be your jury? Is there any provision made, that you shall have a Venire from your county, or even from your state, as they please to call it? No! you are to be tried within the territory of Congress, and Congress itself is to be a party; you are to be deprived of the benefit of a jury from your vicinage, that boast and birthright of a freeman. Should it not, at least, have been provided, that those revenue officers and excisemen, against whom free governments have, always, justly entertained a jealousy, should be citizens of the state? Was it inadmissible, that, they should be endued with the bowels of fellow-citizens? Are we not to expect, that New England will now send us revenue officers, instead of their onions and their apples? When you observe, that the few places, already, under Congress in this state are in the hands of strangers, you will own, that my suspicion is not without some foundation: and, if the first cause of it be required, those, who have served in Congress, can tell you, that the New England Delegates to that Assembly have always stood by each other, and have formed a firm phalanx, which the southern Delegates have not; that, on the contrary, the maneuvers of the former have been commonly engaged, with success, in dividing the latter, against each other. The force of names and of habits is well known, though Scotland and England go now under the general name of Great Britain, the distinction of Scot[c]human and Englishman still subsists, and, how often has the latter [75]complained, that, that northern hive was continually swarming its hungry instruments of undue prerogative over his country. The ingenious Lord Shaftsbury has said that a wheel within a wheel was an absurdity in politics;4 but, where was this ever so manifest, as in this Federal Constitution. The phantom of sovereignty, which is left the state, enables it to legislate in many instances, and lay taxes; to have its tax-gatherers and excisemen too. Unhappy situation where the natural jealousy, and the pride inherent in two separate governments, presiding over the same people, will induce them to vie in the race of taxation to snatch the prize, the spoils of the citizen, that is to glut the vanity of their respective consequence! he, who has meditated on man, and the secret springs, which move him, must expect this. Unhappy situation where two rival excisemen battle at your doors for precedence in seizing these spoils!—In the name of God look well before you leap, consider, that the question is, whether, you would rather be a sovereign or a sharer in sovereignty: whether, as only a few from their abilities and consequence can expect to be delegated, in rotation, to Congress, you are not about to lay the foundation of a dangerous aristocracy. Whether, it is, not more likely that the blaze of LIBERTY will be kept alive among us, when watched on thirteen separate Altars, than when reunited into one, be it ever so refulgent. Consider, whether you are willing to see the state of Virginia dwindle into the insignificance of a town corporate: and as the Mayor Court of Alderman and Common Council in this make by-laws for its own government, you are satisfied with a Governor, Senate, and Assembly, which will have the same authority as “the United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a Republican FORM of government.” Consider that if you pass the Federal Constitution in toto, you subject yourselves to see the doors of your houses, the impenetrable castles of freemen, fly open before the magic wand of an exciseman, and, that, if you should resent and punish the insolence of office, the daring brutality of the publican, perhaps offered to the wife of thy bosom, you will be dragged for trial before a distant tribunal, and there, perhaps, condemned without enjoying the benefit of a jury from your vicinage, your unalienable birthright as a freeman.

Letter,No,Patrick Henry,George Washington,,,10/19/1787,"I was honor’d by the Rect. of your Favor together with a Copy of the proposed Federal constitution, a few Days ago, for which I beg you to accept my Thanks.

The Concern I feel on this account, is really greater than I am able to express. Perhaps mature Reflection may furnish me Reasons to change my present Sentiments into a conformity with the Opinions of those personages for whom I have the highest Reverence.

Letter,Yes,George Mason,Elbridge Gerry,,,10/20/1787,"There is great Contrariety of Opinion in Virginia upon the new Constitution of Government, & tho’ in general it seems to be approved, Yet even its Advocates can not deny that there are in it some very exceptionable & unsafe Articles. I have no Doubt of our Legislatures referring it to a Convention of the People; where it will probably undergo some Alterations. It wou’d be fortunate for America, if the Conventions in the different States cou’d meet upon this important Business about the same time: by a regular & cordial Communication of Sentiments, confining themselves to a few necessary amendments, & determining to join heartily in the System so amended, they might, without Danger of public Convulsion or Confusion, procure a general Adoption of the new Government; but shou’d many of the States pursue such intemperate & violent Measures as the Legislature of Pensylvania [87]has done,2 it requires no great Degree of Penetration to foresee the Consequences—a federal System will be defeated by the rash & improper means taken to support it, & the People of these United States involved in all the Evils of Civil War.—Indeed the precipitation with which the City of Philadelphia,3 & that party in their Legislature, are attempting to force the new Government upon the People, betrays their Consciousness of it’s not bearing the Test of impartial examination—they dread a thorough Knowledge & public Discussion of the Subject, & wish to hurry it down, during the short & raging hour of Approbation.— I beg You will inform me what are the Sentiments of the wise & disinterested part of Your State, & what will probably be the Fate of the new System there; for there is no trusting to public reports or common News Paper Intelligence. As my Objections, which I shewed You to the new Government, were written in a Hurry, & very incorrect, I take the Liberty of inclosing You a more correct Copy."

Letter,Yes,George Lee Turberville,Arthur Lee,,,10/28/1787,"When I went to the post Office to put in my Letter to you I found your favor October 18th.2 on the Table—but being at that time very much engaged—I referred the Answer of yrs untill ye next post— The plan of a Government proposed to us by the Convention-affords matter for conversation to every rank of beings from the Governor to the door keeper—& the opinions appear to be as various as the persons possessing them—the enthusiastic admirers of the thing in toto (fortunately for us) appear the least considerable—a vast consolidated squadron is composed of those who view the plan as an admirable frame wanting only some few amendments to render it desirable—and a pretty considerable band consists of those who hold it as the engine of distruction—& never think or speak of it but with detestation and abhorence—the extremes are certainly erroneous. As it stands—I really think your objections are unaswerable—together with some others that have great weight with me particularly ye unwarrantable & heterogeneous mixture of Legislative, Judicial & executary powers in ye senate.—That truly republican method of forcing the rulers into the character of Citizens again by incapacitating them for service for a given number of years—after having been as many in Office is forgotten—this certainly is a Barrier against oppression that we ought not to give up, & the opposition to it can only be made—by those ambitious persons who may expect to obtain those high offices—Mr. Wilsons sophism has no weight with me when he declares—that at the formation of the state Legislatures we gave up all that we did not reserve—& that in this Constitution we retain all that we do not give up, because I cannot observe upon what foundation he has [128]rested this curious observation3—the same reason is applicable in both cases, to my comprehension—& this points out to me the absolute necessity of a bill of rights—and that a very full & explanatory one too—where not only the Liberty of the press, the trial by Jury of the vicinage & all those great points—but even every the most trivial priviledge that Citizens have a right to possess—shou’d be expressly stipulated and reserved—& the violation of them most scrupulously & Jealously guarded against—Of what consequence is the federal guarantee of republican governments to the individual states, when the power of the Militia’s even is rested in the president—& when we find that the great advocate for the new plan (Mr. Wilson I allude to) is compelled to acknowledge, while he tried to support the future importance of the state Legislatures—that they will be merely Nominal—since the Election of senators—is the only instance he can produce of their existance in Action—& that the representatives shall be voted for by such persons as are qualified to vote for the largest Body of the state Legislatures—is another of his facts, which certainly makes agt. him—since the existance of them in this instance is Nominal & nothing else— Take but the trouble to examine the mode of choosing the president & you will find—that 15 persons may Elect him—in this Choice the Representatives—(if a Majority of Votes is not in favor of one Man)—have a right to choose the president from those who are the forwardest on the poll & they are to Vote by states, take a majority of the seven smallest states & you will find 15 persons competent to the Election of a president— I may be wrong in some of these observations—they occur from the cursorary attention which I have alone been able to give to this subject never having seen it untill within these few days—& the Business of the house has been such as to prevent me even from paying that attention to my Friends that I am bounden to pay to them—by writing as their Representative to them— Let me request you not to forget the convention in this state come in so as to spend a fortnight in the County & you may ensure your Election4— I shall be very much obliged to you for such peices as are furnished by the New York press both for and against this system.

Letter,Yes,Joseph Jones,James Madison,,,10/29/1787,"On my arrival in Richmond the other day I found your favor of the 7th. from New york with some news papers inclosed2—Mr. Thomas Pleasants3 who called on me the next day inquired whether I had lately heard from you which being acknowledged brot. forward a conversation on the new constitution and finding him a strenuous advocate for it, I asked if he had seen or read some peices in favor of it under the signature of an American Citizen; he said he had not—I then informed him I had received some papers from you, which contained three numbers on the subject and did not doubt he wod. be pleased with the perusal of them; whereupon he signified his desire to possess them—when I delivered them to him I told him it wod. not I thought be amiss [if] they were put into the Printers hands, that he might, if he thought proper, insert them in the News paper here—He said he wod. think of it, and I have not seen him since. I shall speak to him again on the subject so soon as I meet with him but have no doubt he will endeavour to have them printed. I must confess I see many objections to the Constitution submitted to the Conventions of the States—that which has the greatest weight with me lies agt. the constitution of the Senate, which being both legislative and Executive and in some respects judiciary is I think radically bad—the President and the Senate too may in some instances legislate for the Union withot. the concurrence of the popular branch as they may make treaties and alliances which when made are to be paramount the law of the land—the State Spirit will also be preserved in the Senate as they are to have equal numbers and equal votes—It is to be feared this Body united with the President as on most occasions it is to be presumed they will act in concert will be an overmatch for the popular branch—Had the Senate been merely legislative even proportioned as they are to the States, it wod. have been less exceptionable; and the President with a member from each State as a privy Council to have composed the Executive. there is also a strong objection agt. the appelate jurisdiction over law and fact, independent [130page icon]of a variety of other objections which are and may be raised agt. the Judiciary arrangement and the undefined powers of that department—I own I should have been pleased to see a declaration of rights accompany this constitution as there is so much in the execution of the Government to be provided for by the legislature and that Body possessing too great a portion of Aristocracy—The legislature may and will probably make proper and wise regulations in the Judiciary as in the execution of that branch of power the Citizens of all the States will generally be equally affected—but the reflection that there exists in the constitution a power that may oppress makes the mind uneasy and that oppression may and will result from the appelate power of unsetling facts does to me appear beyond a doubt—to rehearse the Doubts and difficulties that arise in my mind when I reflect on this part of the Judiciary power wod. I am sure to you be unnecessary—It wod. be more troublesome than usefull to recite the variety of objections that some raise some of them of more others of inconsiderable weight—could I see a change in the Constitution of the Senate and the right of unsetling facts removed from the Court of Appeals I could with much less reluctance yeild my assent to the System—I could wish I own to see some other alterations take place but for the accomplishment of them, I wod. trust to time, and the wisdom and moderation of the legislature rather than impede the puting the new plan in motion, was it in my power, because I well know our desperate situation under the present form of Government. It is at this time very difficult to inform you what is the prevalent opinion among the people—If we are to judge of them at large from their representatives here they must be very much divided and I think the advocates for the new plan rather diminish than increases in number—You will have from the Executive an accot. of the proceedings of the Houses on the report of the Convention—I think they have taken a wise course in delivering it over to the People withot. conveying sentiments of approbation or Disapprobation. As yet nothing of consequence excepting the referring to the People the new Constitution, has been done in the assembly—Tomorrow4 they are to discuss the recommendation of Congress respecting British debts. I think there will be a majority in the Delegates for the repeal of the laws—how it will go down in the Senate I am unable to calculate. You shall be occasionally informed how we go on—"
Letter,Yes,Arthur Lee,Edward Rutledge,,,10/29/1787,"The proposed Constitution begins to undergoe a very serious discussion. The first impression was so favorable, that you will not be surprised at its losing ground. This change of sentiment is such as to render it very doubtful, whether it will be adopted even in Pensylvania. In this State it is thought there is already a majority against it, & in Virginia the opposition is formidable. For my own part, I do not like it. The want of a promised declaration of rights, when by some exceptions in the Body of it, things, in which no power is expressly given, implies that every thing not excepted is given; is a very material defect. The strange & dangerous combination of Legislative, executive, & judicial Powers in the Senate; violates every idea I have of a good & wise Constitution. To what purpose is the power of Impeachment given to the Representative, when it is triable before the Senate which advising in all great matters of State, especially foreign; wou’d frequently be Judges & parties? The Representation in England is about one Member to every 10,000, with us it is to be 1 to 30,000. They have the sole controul of the purse—with us the Senate can amend money bills—with them Impeachment is a high power, a serious terror, with us, it is to be a shadow—All this is calculated to ensure a feeble Representative & a powerful Senate—that is to sacrifise the Democracy to the Aristocracy. Now tho’ I wish to see the Aristocracy have its due weight yet, I can never agree that they shall trample upon the People, & I am persuaded, that a due balance is the best gaurd to the Aristocracy itself, otherwise it will soon run riot & lose itself in a despotism, as in Denmark & Sweden."
Letter,No,Edmund Randolph,James Madison,,,10/29/1787,"My dear friend I have omitted to write to you since my return home,2 from an inability to obtain so accurate a grasp of the Opinions prevailing here, as to justify me in communicating the politics of our legislature. The first raptures in favor of the constitution were excessive. Every town resounded with applause. The conjectures of my reasons for refusing to sign were extraordinary, and so far malicious, as to suppose, that I was chagrined at not carrying every point in my own way, or that I sought for popularity. These were the effluvia until the assembly met. A diversity of opinion appeared immediately on the convening of that body; which gave as evidence of the good fruit from one of the revised laws, by being punctual to the day.3 Among the heroes of opposition were Mr. Henry, Mr. Wm. Cabell, Colo. Bland and Mr. French Strother.4 A great ferment was kept up, until thursday last [25 October], when, contrary to my expectations the debate for calling the convention was conducted with temper, and a vote passed Unanimously for that purpose, freely to discuss and deliberate on the constitution. This is a happy and politick resolution; for I am thoroughly persuaded, that if it had been propounded by the legislature to the people, as we5 propounded it, the constitution would have been rejected and the spirit of union extinguished. At present the final event seems uncertain. There are many warm friends for taking the constitution altogether without the alteration of a letter; among these are Colo. Nicholas and Mr. F. Corbin. But I suspect, that the tide is turning. New objections are daily started, and the opinions of Mr. H—y gain ground. He and I have had several animated discourses; but he recedes so far from me, that we must diverge after a progress of half a degree further; An incidental question is allotted for tomorrow, by which it will be known how the party positively against the constitution stand as to number. A motion was postponed until that day for repealing the laws against the recovery of british debts.6 Much of the repugnance to this motion will be founded on the danger of every defendant being hurried sooner or later to the seat of the Fœderal government. This is the most vulnerable and odious part of the constitution. I shall therefore conclude, if the acts be repealed, that the majority of the legislature may be said to have overcome the most exceptionable points. As to the recusants,7 we have been spoken of illiberally at least. Mr. Mason has declared in assembly that altho’ he is for amendments, he will not quit the union, even if they should not be made. I have thought proper to postpone any explanation of myself, except in private, until Every thing is determined, which may relate to the constitution. I have prepared a letter, and shall send you a copy in a few days.8 I see the Penna. papers abounding with eulogiums on some, and execrations on others, whose opinion they know not substantially. Mr. Pendleton, who is here has expressed himself to this effect: that the constitution is very full of radical faults, & that he would adopt it with a protest as to its imperfections, in order that they may be corrected at a future day— The bar are generally against it. So are the judges of the general court.

Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle (VA),James Wilson,10/31/1787,"Mr. W——’s speech to the meeting at Philadelphia,1 says a correspondent, is really a laughable performance. When the people, said the orator, established the powers of legislation under their separate governments, they vested their representatives with every right and authority, which they did not in explicit terms reserve; but the congressional authority is to be collected from the positive grant alone, expressed in the instrument. This, it seems, is so self-evident a principle, as to be never in danger of being questioned in future, and it will no doubt be sufficient security for posterity to know, that a Pennsylvania attorney established it; and from thence thought himself sufficiently authorised to draw the following conclusion. “Hence it is evident that in the former case every thing which is not reserved is given, but, in the latter the reverse prevails, and every thing which is not given is reserved.” Bravo J——y! this is rare security for the liberty of the press, “that sacred palladium of national freedom.” The futility of this assertion, that, “the trial by jury is abolished in civil cases,” is detected by him, “taking the advantage of his professional experience,” and from this we learn, that it is not yet abolished, but that it may, if Congress think fit; but he undoubtedly knows, that juries are found inconvenient in excise business. He says, that the vesting of a power in Congress to keep up a standing army in time of peace is no new prerogative, because it is exercised at present on the banks of the Ohio: But this subtle reasoner did not consider, that it is now a time of war on the banks of the Ohio. There never was a charge, said he, made with less reason than that of the dread of an aristocracy from this Federal Constitution, and he proves it by Mr. Adams’s doctrine of balances;2 but neither he, nor the balancer, ever considered the futility of that doctrine in a country, where the members composing the different departments of government are necessarily of the same rank, have the same views and interests, and where the only balance, which it was of consequence to attend to, is that between the governors and the governed, has been unfortunately forgotten in this Federal Constitution. In the next place he tells us, much to the purpose, that those who have used the word, corporation, are not aware of its extent, that though in common parlance, it signifies petty associations, it may be applied even to the Federal Union. In the same manner, it may be said, that those, who make use of the word, Chief Magistrate, applied to our governor, do not know the extent of it; as it may also be applied to the Grand Sultan. But the strength of his argument is yet to come, for he plainly proves that the Federal Constitution does not annihilate the state governments, because it calls them Legislatures. They would be cross children indeed, who would cry for a whistle when they get something in the shape of one, especially, when the same whistle is given to it. But why shall we be so wayward as to be alarmed at Congress’s having the power of internal taxation and of laying on excise duties, do not we hear how he says: “I will venture to predict, that the great revenue of the United States must and always will be raised by impost, for being less obnoxious and more productive, the interests of the government will be best promoted by the accommodation of the people.” It would seem then, that dominion not revenue was the motive of inserting it; but no matter, let us give up our liberties, there is no danger, he says we shall be kindly used, and that we shall have a LEGISLATURE, sure never there was as more explicit bill of rights!!! He says, that it is only interested people, who set their faces against the Federal Constitution, it is really a pity that it should miscarry, for he has given the public so striking a specimen of his abilities, that, no doubt, he would get much practice in the supreme Federal Court, should it be thought advisable to allow the benefit of council there."

Letter,No,William Grayson,William Short,,,11/10/1787,"I have recieved your favor, for which I am much obliged; the Convention, at Philada. about which I wrote you, have at length produced (contrary to expectation) an entire new constitution; This has put us all in an uproar.… In Delawar & Maryland I hear of little or no opposition; though in the latter some was expected from Chase & Paca.

Washington however who is a host within himself is strongly in favor of it, & I am at a loss to determine how the matter will be ultimately closed.… With respect to my own sentiments I own I have important objections:—In the first place I think liberty a thing of too much importance to be trusted on the ground of implication: it should rest on principles [151page icon]expressed in the clearest & most unequivocal manner. A bill of rights ought then to have preceded, tryals by jury should have been expressly reserved in Civil as well as Criminal cases. The press ought to have been declared free—I think the federal Courts in the different states wrong—One Court at the session of Congress with appellative jurisdiction in the cases mentioned in the proposed constitution would have been sufficient. The presentation in the Senate ought to have been in the same proportion as the lower house, except in a few cases merely of a federal nature where the little States should be armed with a repulsive quality to preserve their own existence. The power of regulating commerce by a bare majority and that of taxing will ruin the Southern States; and the proposed method of making treaties i e, by two thirds of the Senators present will be the means of losing the Missisippi for ever:—Indeed we have had great difficulty to prevent it from destruction for two years past.— In these & several other instances which I could enumerate, I think the generarility will have too much power, but there are points where I don’t think they have power enough: In order to face foreign powers properly & to preserve their treaties & their faith with them, they should have had a negative upon the State laws with sevl other incidental powers—Witht. this I am satisfied, the new government if adopted will in a year or two be as contemptible as the present.—Upon the whole I look upon the new system as a most ridiculous piece of business—something (entre nouz) like the legs of Nebuchadnezar’s image: It seems to have been formed by jumbling or compressing a number of ideas together, something like the manner in which poems were made in Swift’s flying Island.4 How ever bad as it is, I believe it will be crammed down our throats rough & smooth with all it’s imperfections: the temper of America is changed beyond conception since you were here, & I believe they were ready to swallow almost any thing.… [N.B.] Inclosed are the papers of the day.

Newspaper,No,George Mason,,Massachusetts Centinel,,11/21/1787,"There is no declaration of rights, and of the laws of the general government being paramount to the laws and constitutions of the several States, the declarations of rights in the seperate States are no security. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoyment of the benefit of the common law, which stands here upon no other foundation than its having been adopted by the respective acts forming the Constitutions of the several States. In the House of Representatives there is not the substance, but the shadow only of representation; which can never produce proper information in the Legislature, or inspire confidence in the people; the laws will therefore be generally made by men little concerned in, and unacquainted with their effects and consequences.(a) The Senate have the power of altering all money bills, and of originating appropriations of money, and the salaries of the officers of their own appointment, in conjunction with the President of the United States; although they are not the Representatives of the people, or amenable to them.—These, with their other great powers (viz. their powers in the appointment of Ambassadours, and all publick officers, in making treaties, and in trying all impeachments) their influence upon and connection with the Supreme Executive from these causes, their duration of office, and their being a constant existing body almost continually setting, joined with their being one compleat branch of the Legislature, will destroy any balance in the government, and enable them to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and liberties of the people. The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended, as to absorb and destroy the Judiciaries of the several States; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive, and justice as unattainable by a great part of the community, as in England; and enabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. The President of the United States has no Constitutional Council (a thing unknown in any safe and regular government) he will therefore be unsupported by proper information and advice; and will generally be directed by minions and favourites—or he will become a tool to the Senate—or a Council of State will grow out of the principal officers of the great departments; the worst and most dangerous of all ingredients for such a Council, in a free country; for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive measures, to shelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry into their own misconduct in office: Whereas had a constitutional council been formed (as was proposed) of six members, viz. two from the eastern, two from the middle, and two from the southern States, to be appointed by vote of the States in the House of Representatives, with the same duration and rotation of office as the Senate, the Executive would always have had safe and proper information and advice: The President of such a Council might have acted as Vice-President of the United States, pro tempore, upon any vacancy or disability of the Chief Magistrate; and long continued sessions of the Senate would in a great measure have been prevented. From this fatal defect of a constitutional council has arisen the improper power of the Senate, in the appointment of publick officers, and the alarming dependence and connection between that branch of the Legislature and the Supreme Executive. Hence also sprung that unnecessary and dangerous officer, the Vice-President, who for want of other employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously blending the Executive and Legislative powers; besides always giving to some one of the States an unnecessary and unjust preeminence over the others. The President of the United States has the unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason; which may be sometimes exercised to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt. By declaring all treaties supreme laws of the land, the Executive and the Senate have in many cases, an exclusive power of Legislation; which might have been avoided, by proper distinctions with respect to treaties, and requiring the assent of the House of Representatives, where it could be done with safety. Under their own construction of the general clause at the end of the enumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in trade and commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual [290]and severe punishment, and extend their power as far as they shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no security for the powers now presumed to remain to them; or the people for their rights. There is no declaration of any kind for preserving the liberty of the press, the trial by jury in civil causes, nor against the danger of standing armies in time of peace. The State Legislatures are restrained from laying export duties on their own produce—the general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further importation of slaves for twenty odd years, though such importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable, and less capable of defence.—Both the general legislature, and the state legislatures, are expressly prohibited making expost facto laws, though there never was, nor can be a legislature but must and will make such laws, when necessity and the publick safety require them; which will hereafter be a breach of all the Constitutions in the union, and afford precedents for other innovations. This government will commence in a moderate aristocracy, it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in its operation, produce a monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other. (a) This objection has been in some degree lessened, by an amendment, often before refused, and at last made by an erasure, after the engrossment upon parchment, of the word forty, and inserting thirty, in the 3d clause of the 2d section of the 1st article."

Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Governor Edmund Randolph,Virginia Gazette,,12/6/1787,"Dear Sir, I was duly honored with your favor of September 17th, from Philadelphia, which should have been acknowledged long before now, if the nature of the business that it related to had not required time. The establishment of the new plan of government, in its present form, is a question that involves such immense consequences to the present [367page icon]times and to posterity, that it calls for the deepest attention of the best and wisest friends of their country and of mankind. If it be found good after mature deliberation, adopt it, if wrong, amend it at all events, for to say (as many do) that a bad government must be established for fear of anarchy, is really saying that we must kill ourselves for fear of dying. Experience and the actual state of things, shew that there is no difficulty in procuring a general convention; the late one being collected without any obstruction: Nor does external war, or internal discord prevent the most cool, collected, full, and fair discussion of this all-important subject. If with infinite ease, a convention was obtained to prepare a system, why may not another with equal ease be procured to make proper and necessary amendments? Good government is not the work of a short time, or of sudden thought. From Moses to Montesquieu the greatest geniuses have been employed on this difficult subject, and yet experience has shewn capital defects in the system produced for the government of mankind. But since it is neither prudent or easy to make frequent changes in government, and as bad governments have been generally found the most fixed; so it becomes of the last consequence to frame the first establishment upon ground the most unexceptionable, and such as the best theories with experience justify; not trusting as our new constitution does, and as many approve of doing, to time and future events to correct errors, that both reason and experience in similar cases, point out in the new system. It has hitherto been supposed a fundamental maxim that in governments rightly balanced, the different branches of legislature should be unconnected, and that the legislative and executive powers should be separate:–In the new constitution, the president and senate have all the executive and two thirds of the legislative power. In some weighty instances (as making all kinds of treaties which are to be the laws of the land) they have the whole legislative and executive powers. They jointly, appoint all officers civil and military, and they (the senate) try all impeachments either of their own members, or of the officers appointed by themselves. Is there not a most formidable combination of power thus created in a few, and can the most critic eye, if a candid one, discover responsibility in this potent corps? Or will any sensible man say, that great power without responsibility can be given to rulers with safety to liberty? It is most clear that the parade of impeachment is nothing to them or any of them—as little restraint is to be found, I presume from the fear of offending constituents.–The president is for four years duration (and Virginia for example) has one vote of thirteen in the choice of him, and this thirteenth vote not of the people, but electors, two removes from the people. The senate is a body of six years duration, and as in the choice [368page icon]of president, the largest state has but a thirteenth vote, so is it in the choice of senators.–This latter statement is adduced to shew that responsibility is as little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from the terror of impeachment. You are, therefore, Sir, well warranted in saying, either a monarchy or aristocracy will be generated, perhaps the most grievous system of government may arise. It cannot be denied with truth, that this new constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously oligarchic; and it is a point agreed that a government of the few, is, of all governments, the worst. The only check to be found in favor of the democratic principle in this system is, the house of representatives; which I believe may justly be called a mere shread or rag of representation: It being obvious to the least examination, that small ness of number and great comparative disparity of power, renders that house of little effect to promote good, or restrain bad government. But what is the power given to this ill constructed body? To judge of what may be for the general welfare, and such judgments when made, the acts of Congress become the supreme laws of the land. This seems a power co-extensive with every possible object of human legislation.–Yet there is no restraint in form of a bill of rights, to secure (what Doctor Blackstone calls) that residuum of human rights, which is not intended to be given up to society, and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose.2—The rights of conscience, the freedom of the press, and the trial by jury are at mercy. It is there stated, that in criminal cases, the trial shall be by jury. But how? In the state. What then becomes of the jury of the vicinage or at least from the county in the first instance, for the states being from 50 to 700 miles in extent? This mode of trial even in criminal cases may be greatly impaired, and in civil causes the inference is strong, that it may be altogether omitted as the constitution positively assumes it in criminal, and is silent about it in civil causes.–Nay, it is more strongly discountenanced in civil cases by giving the supreme court in appeals, jurisdiction both as to law and fact. Judge Blackstone in his learned commentaries, art. jury trial, says, it is the most transcendant privilege which any subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, his person, but by the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals.3 A constitution that I may venture to affirm has under providence, secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages.–The impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society. But if that be entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince, or such as enjoy the highest offices of the state, these decisions in spite of their own natural [369page icon]integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity. It is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should always be attentive to the good of the many. The learned judge further says, that every tribunal selected for the decision of facts, is a step towards establishing aristocracy; the most oppressive of all governments. The answer to these objections is, that the new legislature may provide remedies!–But as they may, so they may not, and if they did, a succeeding assembly may repeal the provisions.–The evil is found resting upon constitutional bottom, and the remedy upon the mutable ground of legislation, revocable at any annual meeting. It is the more unfortunate that this great security of human rights, the trial by jury, should be weakened in this system, as power is unnecessarily given in the second section of the third article, to call people from their own country in all cases of controversy about property between citizens of different states and foreigners, with citizens of the United States, to be tried in a distant court where the Congress may sit. For although inferior congressional courts may for the above purposes be instituted in the different states, yet this is a matter altogether in the pleasure of the new legislature, so that if they please not to institute them, or if they do not regulate the right of appeal reasonably, the people will be exposed to endless oppression, and the necessity of submitting in multitudes of cases, to pay unjust demands, rather than follow suitors, through great expence, to far distant tribunals, and to be determined upon there, as it may be, without a jury.–In this congressional legislature, a bare majority of votes can enact commercial laws, so that the representatives of the seven northern states, as they will have a majority, can by law create the most oppressive monopoly upon the five southern states, whose circumstances and productions are essentially different from theirs, although not a single man of these voters are the representatives of, or amenable to the people of the southern states. Can such a set of men be, with the least colour of truth called a representative of those they make laws for? It is supposed that the policy of the northern states will prevent such abuses. But how feeble, Sir, is policy when opposed to interest among trading people:–And what is the restraint arising from policy? Why that we may be forced by abuse to become ship-builders!–But how long will it be before a people of agriculture can produce ships sufficient to export such bulky commodities as ours, and of such extent; and if we had the ships, from whence are the seamen to come? 4000 of whom at least will be necessary in Virginia. In questions so liable to abuse, why was not the necessary vote put to two thirds of the members of the legislature? With the constitution came from the convention, so many members of that body to Congress, and of those too, who were among the most fiery [370page icon]zealots for their system, that the votes of three states being of them, two states divided by them, and many others mixed with them, it is easy to see that Congress could have little opinion upon the subject.4 Some denied our right to make amendments, whilst others more moderate agreed to the right, but denied the expediency of amending; but it was plain that a majority was ready to send it on in terms of approbation—my judgment and conscience forbid the last, and therefore I moved the amendments that I have the honor to send you inclosed herewith, and demanded the yeas and nays that they might appear on the journal. This seemed to alarm and to prevent such appearance on the journal, it was agreed to transmit the constitution without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation; so that the term unanimously only applied to the transmission, as you will observe by attending to the terms of the resolve for transmitting. Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that as this constitution abounds with useful regulations, at the same time that it is liable to strong and fundamental objections, the plan for us to pursue, will be to propose the necessary amendments, and express our willingness to adopt it with the amendments, and to suggest the calling of a new convention for the purpose of considering them. To this I see no well founded objection, but great safety and much good to be the probable result. I am perfectly satisfied that you make such use of this letter as you shall think to be for the public good; and now after begging your pardon for so great a trespass on your patience, and presenting my best respects to your lady, I will conclude with assuring you, that I am with the sincerest esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most affectionate and obedient servant, richard henry lee. postscript.5 It having been found from universal experience, that the most express declarations and reservations are necessary to protect the just rights and liberty of mankind from the silent, powerful and ever active conspiracy of those who govern; and it appearing to be the sense of the good people of America, by the various bills or declarations of rights whereon the government of the greater number of states are founded. That such precautions are necessary to restrain and regulate the exercise of the great powers given to rulers. In conformity with these principles, and from respect for the public sentiment on this subject, it is submitted,–That the new constitution proposed for the government of the United States be bottomed upon a declaration or bill of rights, clearly and precisely stating the principles upon which this social compact is founded, to wit: That the rights of conscience in matters of religion ought not to be violated–That the freedom of the press shall be secured–That the trial by [371page icon]jury in criminal and civil cases, and the modes prescribed by the common law for the safety of life in criminal prosecutions, shall be held sacred–That standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted, unless assented to by two-thirds of the members composing each house of the legislature under the new constitution–That the elections should be free and frequent; That the right administration of justice should be secured by the independency of the judges; That excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments, should not be demanded or inflicted: That the right of the people to assemble peaceably, for the purpose of petitioning the legislature, shall not be prevented; That the citizens shall not be exposed to unreasonable searches, seizure of their persons, houses, papers or property; and it is necessary for the good of society, that the administration of government be conducted with all possible maturity of judgment, for which reason it hath been the practice of civilized nations, and so determined by every state in the Union: That a council of state or privy council should be appointed to advise and assist in the arduous business assigned to the executive power. Therefore let the new constitution be so amended, as to admit the appointment of a privy council, to consist of eleven members chosen by the president, but responsible for the advice they may give. For which purpose the advice given shall be entered in a council book, and signed by the giver, in all affairs of great moment, and that the counsellors act under an oath of office. In order to prevent the dangerous blending of the legislative and executive powers, and to secure responsibility, the privy, and not the senate shall be joined with the president in the appointment of all officers, civil and military, under the new constitution; that the constitution be so altered as not to admit the creation of a vice-president, when duties as assigned may be discharged by the privy council, except in the instance of proceeding in the senate, which may be supplied by a speaker chosen from the body of senators by themselves, as usual, that so may be avoided the establishment of a great officer of state, who is sometimes to be joined with the legislature, and sometimes to administer the government, rendering responsibility difficult, besides giving unjust and needless preeminence to that state from whence this officer may have come. That such parts of the new constitution be amended as provide imperfectly for the trial of criminals by a jury of the vicinage, and to supply the omission of a jury trial in civil causes or disputes about property between individuals, whereby the common law is directed, and as generally it is secured by the several state constitutions. That such parts of the new constitution be amended, as permit the vexatious and oppressive callings [372page icon]of citizens from their own country, and all controversies between citizens of different states and between citizens and foreigners, to be tried in a far distant court, and as it may be without a jury, whereby in a multitude of cases, the circumstances of distance and expence may compel numbers to submit to the most unjust and ill-founded demand–That in order to secure the rights of the people more effectually from violation, the power and respectability of the house of representatives be increased, by increasing the number of delegates to that house, where the popular interest must chiefly depend for protection–That the constitution be so amended as to increase the number of votes necessary to determine questions in cases where a bare majority may be seduced by strong motives of interest to injure and oppress the minority of the community, as in commercial regulations, where advantage may be taken of circumstances to ordain rigid and premature laws, that will in effect amount to monopolies, to the great impoverishment of those states whose peculiar situation expose them to such injuries."
Newspaper,No,Philanthropos (VA),,Independent Chronicle (VA),Brutus (VA),12/6/1787,"The time in which the constitution or government of a nation undergoes any particular change, is always interesting and critical. Enemies are vigilant, allies are in suspense, friends hesitating between hope and [209]fear; and all men are in eager expectation to see what such a change may produce: But the state of our affairs at present, is of such moment, as even to rouse the dead.—Brutus, forsooth, has taken up the cudgels, and that too, against all objections, amendments and improvements, on our new federal form of government: Yet pretends, he has a mighty veneration for a candid investigation, by insinuating that Col. Mason has a design to effect that in a clandestine manner, which he cannot by sound reasoning and solid argument: And the ground for his hypothesis, is, Col. Mason’s not prematurely publishing his objections to said constitution.— Permit me to inform Mr. Brutus, that the public did not appoint that gentleman to a seat in the convention.—The Legislature, alone, appointed him. To the Legislature, alone, is he amenable for all parts of his conduct, while there; and order, as well as common politeness required, that the Legislature, previous to all others, should be informed of his behaviour, and discharge of that office, to which they had appointed him.—If Mr. Brutus has recovered from his lethean slumbers, he must remember to have seen Col. Mason’s first speech, after taking his seat in the House of Delegates, inserted in the public papers, wherein he informs the house, that his reasons for not subscribing the new constitution, should, in due time, be made known to his countrymen.2—It is asserted also, that he handed forth his objections among those on whom he expected them to make the most favorable impressions, which is palpably a falsehood, for several of his most intimate friends requested them, and were refused for the above reasons.—He saw no occasion for hurry (and as ignorance is a misfortune, that humanity bids us pity rather than condemn) always did, and does wish, that the meanest capacities may have time to consider and comprehend that constitution, under which we are about to submit ourselves.—So far is he from seduction, from every thing that can be called clandestine, or a desire to bias people in his opinion, that he wishes every man to judge, and form an opinion for himself, which is another reason why he did not publish his objections earlier. And therefore the attempt Brutus has made to shew the badness of his heart, serves only to demonstrate the ignorance of his own head.—After inserting the objections, he winds up the whole, by saying, that they are more calculated to alarm the fears of the people, than to answer any valuable end—was that the case, as it is not, will any man in his sober senses, say, that the least infringement, or appearance of infringement on our liberty, that liberty, which has lately cost so much blood and treasure, together with anxious days and sleepless nights, ought not both to rouse our fears and awaken our jealousy. Truly the [210]gentleman’s arguments and sentiments (if he has expressed them) are as futile as his name is fictitious.—The new constitution in its present form, is calculated to produce despotism, thraldom and confusion, and if the United States do swallow it, they will find it a bolus, that will create convulsions to their utmost extremities.—Were they mine enemies, the worst imprecation I could devise would be, may they adopt it: For tyranny, which has been chained (as for a few years past) is always more cursed, and sticks its teeth in deeper than [before?].—Were Col. Mason’s objections obviated, the improvement would be very considerable, though even then, not so complete as might be.—The Congress’s having power without controul, to borrow money on the credit of the United States: Their having power to appoint their own salaries, and their being paid out of the treasury of the United States, thereby, in some measure, rendering them independent of the individual States, also their being judges of the qualification and election of their own members, by which means they can get men to suit any purpose, together with Col. Mason’s wise and judicious objections, are grievances, the very idea of which, is enough to make every honest citizen exclaim in the language of Cato, O liberty, O my country!3—Our present constitution, with a few additional powers to Congress, seems better calculated to preserve the rights, and defend the liberties of our citizens, than the one proposed, without proper amendments.—Let us therefore, for once, shew our judgment and solidity, by continuing it; and prove the opinion to be erroneous, that levity and fickleness, are not only the foibles of our tempers, but the reigning principles in these States.—There are men amongst us, of such dissatisfied tempers, that place them in Heaven, they would find something to blame; and so restless and self-sufficient, that they must be eternally reforming the state; but the misfortune is, they always leave affairs worse than they find them.—A change of government is at all times dangerous, but at present may be fatal, without the utmost caution, just after emerging out of a tedious and expensive war—Feeble in our nature, and complicated in our form, we are little able to bear the rough jostlings of civil dissensions, which are likely to ensue.—Even now, discontent and opposition distract our councils:—Division and despondency affect our people. Is it then a time, to alter our government, that government, which, even now totters on its foundation, and will, without tender care, produce ruin by its fall.— Beware my countrymen! our enemies, uncontrolled as they are in their ambitious schemes: Fretted with losses, and perplexed with disappointments, will exert their whole power and policy to increase and [211]continue our confusion; and while we are destroying one another, they will be repairing their losses, and ruining our trade.— Of all the plagues that infest a nation, a civil war is the worst. Famine is severe, pestilence is dreadful; but in these, though men die, they die in peace; the father expires without the guilt of the son; and the son, if he survives, enjoys the inheritance of his father: Cities may be thinned, but they are neither plundered nor burnt.—But when a civil war is kindled, there is thenceforth no security of property; nor protection from any law; life and fortune become precarious; and all that is dear to men is at the discretion of a profligate soldiery, doubly licentious on such an occasion. Cities are exhausted by heavy contributions, or sacked because they cannot answer the exorbitant demand. Countries are eaten up by the parties they favor, and ravaged by the one they oppose; fathers and sons, sheath their swords in one anothers bowels in the field, and their wives and daughters, are exposed to the rudeness and lust of ruffians at home. And when the sword has decided the quarrel, the scene is closed with banishments, forfeitures, and barbarous executions, that entail distress on children then unborn. May Heaven avert the dreadful catastrophe! In the most limited governments, what wranglings, animosities, factions, partiality, and all other evils, that tend to embroil a nation and weaken a state, are constantly practiced by legislators. What then may we expect if the new constitution be adopted as it now stands? The great will struggle for power, honor and wealth, the poor become a prey to avarice, insolence and oppression, and while some are studying to supplant their neighbours, and others striving to keep their stations, one villain will wink at the oppression of another, the people be fleeced, and the public business neglected. From despotism and tyranny good Lord deliver us. N.B. I am sorry I had not an opportunity of seeing Mr. Brutus’s piece earlier, or should have answered it in course."
Broadside,No,A True Friend,,,,12/6/1787,"To the ADVOCATES for the NEW FEDERAL CONSTITUTION; and to their ANTAGONISTS. gentlemen, You have already pretty nearly agreed, if you be, as I believe you are, well intentioned; at least it is easy to compromise matters between you, unless under the veil of the public good, or of a jealous care for the liberties of your country, you are actuated by private or interested motives. If you are swayed by the pure and chaste love alone of your country, I, this day, offer myself to become arbitrator between you; to reconcile your differences, and if possible, put an end to these ingenious dissertations, which hold the public opinion in suspense. Let us then, in the first place, agree on a few preliminary positions. You, gentlemen, the preachers up of the new Constitution, will not surely contest a fact proved by the records of all ages and of all nations, that is, that the liberties and the rights of the people have been always encroached on, and finally destroyed by those, whom they had entrusted with the powers of government; these have continually abused the confidence reposed in them; and whether this confidence was placed in a single magistrate, or in a body of magistrates, the authority ceded to them by the people has been constantly turned against themselves; has subjected; and in fine enslaved them. The precaution, which they have sometimes taken, to divide this solemn trust amongst different departments, and to balance these one against the other, has not been hitherto capable of affording a sufficient mound against these dreadful encroachments; for it is unhappily in the nature of men, when collected for any purpose whatsoever into a body, to take a selfish and interested bias, tending invariably towards the encreasing of their prerogatives and the prolonging of the term of their function; but what is yet more unfortunate, those corps have been always victorious over the unconnected, the divided opposition, that men acting individually could make against them: Since then this fact is as certain and incontrovertible a principle in politics, as universal attraction is in physics, the people of this country, blessed with the heavenly boon of liberty, ought to be, to day, not only circumspect, but cautious and suspicious too in the extent of the powers they should delegate, in the choice of the persons they should delegate them to, and in the term of time it may be prudent to continue them in office; thus to guard against incurring the same fate with all the different governments, with which we have been hitherto made acquainted. It would even seem as if the examples, which Poland, Sweden, Geneva, and Holland exhibit, had been reserved by providence for this age, to give this rising empire more striking and experimental lessons. Neither can you, gentlemen, who oppose the new constitution, disown the pressing necessity there is for a federal constitution, which may reunite into one whole, and on an uniform regular plan, the different interests and separate advantages of the thirteen states, united at present, ’tis true, in name; though in fact divided and opposed one to the other. You wish, or most undoubtedly you ought to wish, to see good order and mutual confidence established at home, and your credit and reputation flourishing among the nations abroad; these, these are the means, which must give a rapid progresion to our agriculture, to our commerce, and to our navigation. Without these main springs of public felicity, our finances must necessarily remain in their present state of penury and contempt, we shall continue overwhelmed without debts and difficulties, and be daily forced on ruinous and dishonorable expedients: We shall thus be stunted in our growth, nor can we surely flatter ourselves with being esteemed a free, happy, and recommendable people. These two cardinal points being thus invariably fixed, and, too true to say, incontestible by either party; the obvious consequences are—1st. A pressing necessity for a new plan of general government; and 2d.—The indispensible obligation we are under to ourselves, to posterity, to the whole world in short, to guard with jealous care and watchful anxiety, in its utmost purity, that glorious and darling deposit, with which Providence has blessed us, perhaps, for the common good of mankind: These should be the aims of every true patriot, and they are doubtless these of both contending parties. To ensure success in the attaining of them, the different states culled out the men of the most enlightened understandings and of the most conspicuous merit: They brought them together in order to discuss, balance and arrange their separate and individual interests, on a uniform comprehensive plan, and into a system founded on justice and reciprocal advantages: It was out of this assembly alone, that we could flatter ourselves that this grand and generous system should arise; there, opinions were contrasted and wisdom united—partial views were banished—salutary and indispensible concessions mutually made;—there, objections were discussed, and satisfactory solutions given to them: It is therefore now both useless and impossible for us to reply to all these, which each state may make, and how much more would the difficulty encrease, should it be attempted to give answers to each individual in those states? None of those are now placed in the proper situation, to take a large and comprehensive view of this extensive prospect; they see but their immediate, partial, and, perhaps, delusive interests: The people in their private capacities are not more likely to discover the solidity or the futility of the reasons, or of the objections of each party. The [219]encomiums and the censures, the attacks and the defences, are set forthwith equal acrimony and address; they terrify but do not instruct us: These essays and reasonings give, indeed, proofs of the ingenuity and talents of the champions, and sometimes, alas, of the abuse which they make of them! They likewise prove a melancholy truth; of which every man of reflection had been previously convinced. It is, the impossibility of framing a good constitution on any one invariable foundation so firmly as never to be shaken. The best that can be devised will at last be vitiated by the corroding hand of time, and can only be kept pure by continually modifying it according to circumstances, and by bringing it now and then to the test of its general principles: The citizens of America will then, with the utmost reason, repose no confidence in these writers and reasoners, who are ready to level without being able to edify; who raise doubts and fears in order to hinder or to retard the execution of a plan, which is the result of the reflection, the debates and the wisdom of patriots, whom they themselves made choice of: But, as notwithstanding their extensive knowledge and their pure intentions, they are not exempted from the common lot of human frailty, and as it is possible, that they may have erred in some parts of that great art, so difficult to be attained, of governing without enslaving; as the extent of our country, our situation, our manners and national character cannot be pertinently compared to any thing, which has hitherto existed on earth, we should not, consequently, model ourselves servilely on any system of government, which has yet appeared, or pin our faith on any political writer whatsoever, be his reputation what it may. Sound reason and urgent necessity lay their positive commands on us to accept the new federal constitution; but, on the other hand prudence seems to require from us, that we should adopt it on trial only for a certain limited time, for eight, ten, or twelve years: at the expiration of which ever of these periods may be agreed on, we will again call a general convention, in order to rectify the defects or lapses, which the unerring guides, time and experience may discover; this will then reform what our circumstances may point out for reformation. It is a general principle in legislation, which, if well understood, would abridge very much the study of that science for the body of the people, that the greater the power is with which it invests its governors, the shorter should be the limits of its duration; and on the contrary, that the smaller the power is, the longer it may be permitted to continue. This may be held as certain an axiom in politics as this is in mechanics; that2 we cannot increase force but at the expence of velocity, nor increase velocity but at the expence of force. The constitution fixed on at the time of the declaration of our independence was universally admired; it was then, perhaps, the best we could aspire to, we now find it [220]inadequate, and we reform it. The new constitution has its enthusiastic admirers, it is nevertheless imprudent that we should accept it on any other condition, but that of its laying itself open at a stated period for correction, if necessary, or for being confirmed for another stated period, if expedient: Under these two grand guides, time and experience, we shall become expert in the intricate and complicated science of legislation; we shall be looked up to as models by other nations, instead of our servilely copying their institutions; we shall enjoy the singular3 advantage, hitherto unexampled, to reform our government insensibly and by degrees, without experiencing those violent concussions and catastrophes, which have desolated nations when they attempted a reform. Another precaution seems indispensibly necessary. Notwithstanding Mr. Wilson’s assertion, that every thing which is not given up by this federal constitution, is reserved to the body of the people;4 that security is not sufficient to calm the inquietude of a whole nation. Let us then insert in the first page of this constitution, as a preamble to it, a declaration of our rights, or an enumeration of our prerogatives, as a sovereign people; that they may never hereafter be unknown, forgotten or contradicted by our representatives, our delegates, our servants in Congress: Let the recognition, and solemn ratification by Congress, of this declaration of rights, be made the sine qua non of the adoption of this new federal constitution, by each state. This precious, this comfortable page, will be the ensign, to which on any future contestation, time may induce between the governed and those intrusted with the powers of government, the asserters of liberty may rally, and constitutionally defend it. The rights of the people should never be left subject to problematical discussion: They should be clear, precise and authenticated: They should never stand in need of the comments or explanations of lawyers or political writers, too apt, we know, to entangle the plainest rights in their net of sophistry: What man of upright intentions will dare to say, that free men giving up such extensive prerogatives to their rulers, as the new federal constitution requires, should not at the same time put them in mind of the rights, which constitute them such? If there be any person who says, that implication, that forced construction should satisfy their doubts, ye imps of hell whip me such fiend! I now most earnestly pray, that both the fautors and the opponents of the new federal constitution, may deign to accept this compromise. If either party refuse to subscribe to it, let them be judged by their country, and if I mistake not, they will be found guilty of the treacherous views, and dark designs with which they are so ready to asperse their antagonists. December 5, 1787."
Letter,Yes,Matthew Maury,James Maury,,,12/10/1787,"My Dear Brother … The Face of things is greatly changed in this Country[,] changed for the Worse since you left it—The Distresses of the People in general, consequent on the heavy Taxes, & their private Debts are greater than you can well conceive. Many, or at least some, of the back Counties have refused to pay the Taxes last Year, & I am apprehensive, their Example will be followed by a great Number in the next. As to my own Part, from the Distresses & the general Discontent of the People I take it for granted we are on the Eve of a Revolution. Many promise themselves great Things from the New Constitution, should it be adopted. But I doubt much whether it will do—It may suspend for a while, but I hardly think it will entirely avert our Fate: For I think I can see plainly from the Temper of the People, that Nothing short of an Abolition of all Debts will in the End satisfy them. Be cautious who you Trust on this Side the Water.… The last has been the dryest Summer remembered by the oldest Men in this Country,—in many Parts, particularly in this Neighbourhood, there was not a Rain from early in March till late in October, sufficient to wett the Earth more than two Inches.—In consequence of which the Crops of Corn are shorter than ever known.

Tis not sir to draw from you—your opinions—but merely to be informed of some parts of the Plan of Government proposed by the convention at Philadelphia—which appear obscure to a Reader that I have ventured to interrupt you, seeing that it is impossible to receive any information in the circle here—but what manifestly bears ye Stamp of faction—rancour—or intemperance— Upon a question of Such importance—(on which perhaps it may be my lot to have a Vote)2 you will therefore excuse me for endeavoring to understand the subject as well as possible to the end that I may be enabled to form cooly & deliberately—such an opinion of it as my best abilities—aided by extreme attention—& all the information I can obtain—will admit—without further apology therefore I will proceed to mention such parts of the plan as appear obscure to me—always premising that it is not my wish to draw from you your own opinions, but only the reasonings thereon—& the objects thereof that weighed with the convention— The principal objection that the opponents bring forward against this Constitution, is the total want of a Bill of Rights—this they build upon as an essential—and altho’ I am satisfied that an enumeration of those priviledges which we retained—wou’d have left floating in uncertainty a number of non enumerated contingent powers and priviledges—either in the powers granted or in those retained—thereby indisputably trenching upon the powers of the states—& of the Citizens—insomuch as those not specially retained might by just implication have been consider’d as surrender’d—still it wou’d very much assist me in my determination upon this subject if the sense of the Convention and their opinion upon it cou’d be open’d to me3— Another objection (and that I profess appears very weighty with me) is the want of a Council of State to assist the President—to detail to you the various reasons that lead to this opinion is useless. You have seen them in all the publications almost that pretend to analyse this system—most particularly in Colo. Masons We have heard from private persons that a system of government was engrossed—which had an Executive council—and that the priviledge of importing slaves (another great evil) was not mention’d in it—but that a Coalition took place between the members of the small states—& those of the southern states—& they barter’d the Council for the Priviledge—and the present plan thus defective—owes it origin to this Junction4—if this was the case it takes greatly off from the confidence that I ever conceived to [233]be due to this Convention—such conduct wou’d appear rather like the attempt of a party to carry an interested measure in a state legislature than the production of the United Wisdom—Virtue—& Uprightness of America called together to deliberate upon a form of Government that will affect themselves & their latest Posterity.— The operation of the Judiciary is a matter so far beyond the reach of most of our fellow Citizens that we are bounden to receive—& not to originate our opinions upon this branch of ye Federal government—Lawyers alone conceive themselves masters of this subject & they hold it forth to us danger & distress as the inevitable result of the new system—& that this will proceed from the immense power of the general Judiciary—which will pervade the states from one extremity to the other & will finally absorb—& destroy the state Courts—But to me their power seem’s very fairly defined by the clauses that constitute them—& the mention of Juries, in criminal cases—seeming therefor by implication in civil cases—not to be allowed, is the only objection I have to this Branch— Why shou’d the United states in Congress Assembled be enabled to fix on the places of choosing the Representatives? Why shou’d the Laws of the Union operate agt. & supercede—the state Constitutions? Wou’d not an uniform duty—impost—or excise of £5. pr. hhd on Tobo. exported—throughout the United states—operate upon the Tobo. states alone? & have not the U. S. the power of levying this impost? Why shou’d the states be prevented from raising a Revenue by Duties or Taxes—on their own Exports? Are the states not bound down to direct Taxation for the support of their police & government? Why was not that truely republican mode of forcing the Rulers or sovereigns of the states to mix after stated Periods with the people again—observed—as is the case with the present members of Congress—Governors of this state &c &c—? For what Reason—or to answer what republican View is it, that the way is left open for the importation of Negro slaves for twenty one Yrs? May not the powers of the Congress from the clause which enables them to pass all Laws necessary to carry this system into effect—& that clause also which declares their Laws to be paramount to the Constitutions of the states—be so operated upon as to annihilate the state Governments? If the Laws of the United states are to be superior to the Laws & Constitutions of the several states, why was not a Bill of Rights affixed [234]to this Constitution by which the Liberties of individuals might have been secured against the abuse of Federal Power? If Treaties are to be the Laws of the Land and to supercede all laws and Constitutions of the states—why is the Ratification of them left to the senate & President—and not to the house of Representatives also? These queries if satisfactorily answer’d will defeat all the attempts of the opposition—many of them I can readily answer to satisfy myself—but I still doubt whether my fondness for the new government may not make me as improper a Judge in its favor, as the rage of the opposition renders those who are under its influence inadequate to decide even agt. it— You will I hope my good sir excuse this scrawl which is scarcely legible it has been written by peice meals—& as I cou’d snatch an opportunity from the hurry of business—& from the noise & clamour of the disputants at ye house in which I lodge—the Mail is just going out and I have not time—to add the detail of State politics—but as I have written on the subject of the federal Constitution—I will Just detain you for a moment on ye present Situation of it in this state— The people in the Country generally for it—the doctrine of amendments exploded by them—the Assembly I fear agt. it—Mr. Henry—Mr. Harrison—Mr. smith—All the Cabells & Colo.

Newspaper,No,C.D.,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,12/26/1787,"Mr. Printer, By inserting the following, you will oblige one of your Readers. C.D. The articles of confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state, and the union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State.1 The Act of Assembly authorising the meeting in Philadelphia, authorises them to propose alterations, which, if agreed to by a Congress of the United States, and duly ratified by the several States in the union, shall be adopted.2 The new Constitution proposes a Government not ratified by the Legislature, but only to be ratified by nine States. This new Government must therefore be established contrary to the present laws of the union. If it shall be adopted, what security can we have for amending it at any future day? for the clause therein proposing a method of altering the new system, may also be set aside and some other method proposed. The conclusion I draw then is, that although the people be called to ratify the new plan, the present laws of the union forbid any alteration, without consent of the Legislatures. And the law under which the Philadelphia Deputies were appointed, requires a ratification by all the States; therefore under that law no act of nine States can dissolve the union. Richmond, Dec. 19, 1787."
Letter,No,Edmund Randolph,,,,12/27/1787,"Sir, The Constitution, which I inclosed to the General Assembly in a late official letter, appears without my signature. This circumstance, although trivial in its own nature, has been rendered rather important to myself at least, by being misunderstood by some, and misrepresented by others—As I disdain to conceal the reasons for with-holding my subscription, I have always been, still am, and ever shall be, ready to proclaim them to the world. To the legislature therefore, by whom I was deputed to the Fœderal Convention, I beg leave now to address them; affecting no indifference to public opinion, but resolved not to court it by an unmanly sacrifice of my own judgment. As this explanation will involve a summary, but general review of our fœderal situation, you will pardon me, I trust, although I should transgress the usual bounds of a letter. Before my departure for the Convention, I believed, that the confederation was not so eminently defective, as it had been supposed.1 But after I had entered into a free communication with those, who were best informed of the condition and interest of each state; after I had compared the intelligence derived from them, with the properties which ought to characterize the government of our union, I became persuaded, that the confederation was destitute of every energy, which a constitution of the United States ought to possess. For the objects proposed by its institution were, that it should be a shield against foreign hostility, and a firm resort against domestic commotion: that it should cherish trade, and promote the prosperity of the states under its care. But these are not among the attributes of our present union. Severe experience under the pressure of war—a ruinous weakness, manifested since the return of peace—and the contemplation of those dangers, which darken the future prospect, have condemned the hope of grandeur and of safety under the auspices of the confederation. In the exigencies of war indeed the history of its effects is short; the final ratification having been delayed until the beginning of the year 1781. But howsoever short, this period is distinguished by melancholy testimonies, of its inability to maintain in harmony the social intercourse of the states, to defend Congress against incroachments on their rights, and to obtain by requisitions supplies to the fœderal treasury of recruits to the fœderal armies. I shall not attempt an enumeration of the particular instances; but leave to your own remembrance and the records of Congress, the support of these assertions. In the season of peace too not many years have elapsed; and yet each of them has produced fatal examples of delinquency, and sometimes of pointed opposition to fœderal duties. To the various remonstrances of Congress I appeal for a gloomy, but unexaggerated narrative of the injuries, which our faith, honor and happiness have sustained by the failures of the states. But these evils are past; and some may be lead by an honest zeal to conclude, that they cannot be repeated. Yes, sir; they will be repeated as long as the confederation exists, and will bring with them other mischiefs, springing from the same source, which cannot be yet foreseen in their full array of terror. If we examine the constitutions, and laws of the several states, it is immediately discovered, that the law of nations is unprovided with sanctions in many cases, which deeply affect public dignity and public justice. The letter, however of the confederation does not permit Congress to remedy these defects, and such an authority, although evidently deducible from its spirit, cannot, without a violation of the second article,2 be assumed. Is it not a political phænomenon, that the head of the confederacy should be doomed to be plunged into war, from its wretched impotency to check offences against this law? And sentenced to witness in unavailing anguish the infraction of their engagements to foreign sovereigns? And yet this is not the only grievous point of weakness. After a war shall be inevitable, the requisitions of Congress for quotas of men or money, will again prove unproductive and fallacious. Two causes will always conspire to this baneful consequence. 1. No government can be stable, which hangs on human inclination alone, unbiassed by the fear of coercion; and 2. from the very connection between states bound to proportionate contributions,—jealousies and suspicions naturally arise, which at least chill the ardor, if they do not excite the murmurs of the whole. I do not forget indeed, that by one sudden impulse our part of the American continent has been thrown into a military posture, and that in the earlier annals of the war, our armies marched to the field on the mere recommendations of Congress. But ought we to argue from a contest, thus signalized by the magnitude of its stake, that as often as a flame shall be hereafter kindled, the same enthusiasm will fill our legions? or renew them, as they may be thinned by losses? If not, where shall we find protection? Impressions, like those, which prevent a compliance with requisitions of regular forces, will deprive the American republic of the services of militia. But let us suppose, that they are attainable, and acknowledge, as I always shall, that they are the natural support of a free government. When it is remembered, that in their absence agriculture must languish; that they are not habituated to military exposures and the rigor of military discipline, and that the necessity of holding in readiness successive detachments, carries the expence far beyond that of inlistments-—this resource ought to be adopted with caution. As strongly too am I persuaded, that requisitions for money will not be more cordially received. For besides the distrust, which would prevail with respect to them also; besides the opinion, entertained by each state of its own liberality and unsatisfied demands against the United States, there is another consideration, not less worthy of attention. The first rule for determining each quota was the value of all land granted or surveyed, and of the buildings and improvements thereon.3 It is no longer doubted, that an equitable, uniform mode of estimating that value, is impracticable; and therefore twelve states have substituted the number of inhabitants under certain limitations, as the standard according to which money is to be furnished.4 But under the subsisting articles of the union, the assent of the thirteenth state is necessary, and has not yet been given. This does of itself lessen the hope of procuring a revenue for fœderal uses; and the miscarriage of the impost almost rivets our despondency.5 Amidst these disappointments, it would afford some consolation, if when rebellion shall threaten any state, an ultimate asylum could be found under the wing of Congress. But it is at least equivocal, whether they can intrude forces into a state, rent asunder by civil discord, even with the purest solicitude for our fœderal welfare, and on the most urgent intreaties of the state itself. Nay the very allowance of this power would be pageantry alone, from the want of money and of men. To these defects of Congressional power, the history of man has subjoined others, not less alarming. I earnestly pray, that the recollection of common sufferings, which terminated in common glory, may check the sallies of violence, and perpetuate mutual friendship between the states. But I cannot presume, that we are superior to those unsocial passions, which under like circumstances have infested more ancient [265page icon]nations. I cannot presume, that through all time, in the daily mixture of American citizens with each other, in the conflicts for commercial advantages, in the discontents, which the neighborhood of territory has been seen to engender in other quarters of the globe, and in the efforts of faction and intrigue—thirteen distinct communities under no effective superintending controul (as the United States confessedly now are notwithstanding the bold terms of the confederation) will avoid a hatred to each other deep and deadly. In the prosecution of this inquiry we shall find the general prosperity to decline under a system thus unnerved. No sooner is the merchant prepared for foreign ports with the treasures, which this new world kindly offers to his acceptance, than it is announced to him, that they are shut against American shipping, or opened under oppressive regulations. He urges Congress to a counter-policy, and is answered only by a condolence on the general misfortune. He is immediately struck with the conviction, that until exclusion shall be opposed to exclusion and restriction to restriction, the American flag will be disgraced. For who can conceive, that thirteen legislatures, viewing commerce under different relations, and fancying themselves, discharged from every obligation to concede the smallest of their commercial advantages for the benefit of the whole, will be wrought into a concert of action in defiance of every prejudice? Nor is this all:—Let the great improvements be recounted, which have inriched and illustrated Europe: Let it be noted, how few those are, which will be absolutely denied to the United States, comprehending within their boundaries the choicest blessings of climate, soil and navigable waters; then let the most sanguine patriot banish, if he can, the mortifying belief, that all these must sleep, until they shall be roused by the vigour of a national government. I have not exemplified the preceding remarks by minute details; because they are evidently fortified by truth, and the consciousness of United America. I shall therefore no longer deplore the unfitness of the confederation to secure our peace; but proceed, with a truly unaffected distrust of my own opinions, to examine what order of powers the government of the United States ought to enjoy? how they ought to be defended against incroachment? whether they can be interwoven in the confederation without an alteration of its very essence? or must be lodged in new hands? shewing at the same time the convulsions, which seem to await us from a dissolution of the union or partial confederacies. To mark the kind and degree of authority, which ought to be confided to the government of the United States is no more than to reverse the description, which I have already given, of the defects of the confederation. From thence it will follow, that the operations of peace and war will be clogged without regular advances of money, and that these will be slow indeed, if dependent on supplication alone. For what better name do requisitions deserve, which may be evaded or opposed, without the fear of coercion? But although coercion is an indispensable ingredient, it ought not to be directed against a state, as a state; it being impossible to attempt it except by blockading the trade of the delinquent, or carrying war into its bowels. Even if these violent schemes were eligible, in other respects both of them might perhaps be defeated by the scantiness of the public chest; would be tardy in their complete effect, as the expence of the land and naval equipments must be first reimbursed; and might drive the proscribed state into the desperate resolve of inviting foreign alliances. Against each of them lie separate unconquerable objections. A blockade is not equally applicable to all the states, they being differently circumstanced in commerce and in ports; nay an excommunication from the privileges of the union would be vain, because every regulation or prohibition may be easily eluded under the rights of American citizenship, or of foreign nations. But how shall we speak of the intrusion of troops? shall we arm citizens against citizens, and habituate them to shed kindred blood? shall we risque the inflicting of wounds, which will generate a rancour never to be subdued? would there be no room to fear, that an army accustomed to fight, for the establishment of authority, would salute an emperor of their own? Let us not bring these things into jeopardy. Let us rather substitute the same process, by which individuals are compelled to contribute to the government of their own states. Instead of making requisitions to the legislatures, it would appear more proper, that taxes should be imposed by the fœderal head, under due modifications and guards: that the collectors should demand from the citizens their respective quotas, and be supported as in the collection of ordinary taxes. It follows too, that, as the general government will be responsible to foreign nations, it ought to be able to annul any offensive measure, or inforce any public right. Perhaps among the topics on which they may be aggrieved or complain, the commercial intercourse, and the manner, in which contracts are discharged, may constitute the principal articles of clamour. It follows too, that the general government ought to be the supreme arbiter for adjusting every contention among the states. In all their connections therefore with each other, and particularly in commerce, which will probably create the greatest discord, it ought to hold the reins. It follows too, that the general government ought to protect each state against domestic as well as external violence. And lastly it follows, that through the general government alone can we ever assume the rank, to which we are entitled by our resources and situation. Should the people of America surrender these powers, they can be paramount to the constitutions, and ordinary acts of legislation, only by being delegated by them. I do not pretend to affirm, but I venture to believe, that if the confederation had been solemnly questioned in opposition to our constitution or even to one of our laws, posterior to it, it must have given way. For never did it obtain with us a higher ratification, than a resolution of Assembly in the daily form.6 This will be one security against incroachment. But another not less effectual is, to exclude the individual states from any agency in the national government, as far as it may be safe, and their interposition may not be absolutely necessary. But now, sir, permit me to declare, that in my humble judgment the powers by which alone the blessings of a general government can be accomplished, cannot be interwoven in the confederation without a change of its very essence; or in other words, that the confederation must be thrown aside. This is almost demonstrable from the inefficacy of requisitions and from the necessity of converting them into acts of authority. My suffrage, as a citizen, is also for additional powers. But to whom shall we commit these acts of authority, these additional powers? To Congress?—When I formerly lamented the defects in the jurisdiction of Congress, I had no view to indicate any other opinion, than that the fœderal head ought not to be so circumscribed. For free as I am at all times to profess my reverence for that body, and the individuals, who compose it, I am yet equally free to make known my aversion to repose such a trust in a tribunal so constituted. My objections are not the visions of theory, but the result of my own observation in America, and of the experience of others abroad. 1. The legislative and executive are concentred in the same persons. This, where real power exists, must eventuate in tyranny. 2. The representation of the states bears no proportion to their importance. This is an unreasonable subjection of the will of the majority to that of the minority. 3. The mode of election and the liability to be recalled may too often render the delegates rather partizans of their own states, than representatives of the union. 4. Cabal and intrigue must consequently gain an ascendancy in a course of years. 5. A single house of [268page icon]legislation will some times be precipitate, perhaps passionate. 6. As long as seven states are required for the smallest, and nine for the greatest votes, may not foreign influence at some future day insinuate itself, so as to interrupt every active exertion? 7. To crown the whole, it is scarcely within the verge of possibility, that so numerous an assembly should acquire that secrecy, dispatch, and vigour, which are the test of excellence in the executive department. My inference from these facts and principles is, that the new powers must be deposited in a new body, growing out of a consolidation of the union, as far as the circumstances of the states will allow. Perhaps, however, some may meditate its dissolution, and others partial confederacies. The first is an idea awful indeed and irreconcileable with a very early, and hitherto uniform conviction, that without union we must be undone. For before the voice of war was heard, the pulse of the then colonies was tried and found to beat in unison. The unremitted labour of our enemies was to divide, and the policy of every Congress to bind us together. But in no example was this truth more clearly displayed, than in the prudence, with which independence was unfolded to the sight, and in the forbearance to declare it, until America almost unanimously called for it. After we had thus launched into troubles, never before explored, and in the hour of heavy distress, the remembrance of our social strength not only forbade despair, but drew from Congress the most illustrious repetition of their settled purpose to despise all terms, short of independence. Behold then, how successful and glorious we have been, while we acted in fraternal concord. But let us discard the illusion, that by this success and this glory the crest of danger has irrecoverably fallen. Our governments are yet too youthful to have acquired stability from habit. Our very quiet depends upon the duration of the union. Among the upright and intelligent, few can read without emotion the future fate of the states, if severed from each other. Then shall we learn the full weight of foreign intrigue. Then shall we hear of partitions of our country. If a prince, inflamed by the lust of conquest, should use one state, as the instrument of enslaving others—if every state is to be wearied by perpetual alarms, and compelled to maintain large military establishments—if all questions are to be decided by an appeal to arms, where a difference of opinion cannot be removed by negotiation—in a word, if all the direful misfortunes, which haunt the peace of rival nations, are to triumph over the land—for what have we contended? Why have we exhausted our wealth? Why have we basely betrayed the heroic martyrs of the federal cause? But dreadful as the total dissolution of the union is to my mind, I entertain no less horror at the thought of partial confederacies. I have not the least ground for supposing, that an overture of this kind would be listened to by a single state; and the presumption is, that the politics of the greater part of the states flow from the warmest attachment to an union of the whole. If however a lesser confederacy could be obtained, by Virginia, let me conjure my countrymen well to weigh the probable consequences, before they attempt to form it. On such an event, the strength of the union would be divided into two or perhaps three parts. Has it so increased since the war as to be divisible?—and yet remain sufficient for our happiness? The utmost limit of any partial confederacy, which Virginia could expect to form, would comprehend only the three southern states, and her nearest northern neighbour. But they, like ourselves, are diminished in their real force, by the mixture of an unhappy species of population. Again may I ask, whether the opulence of the United States has been augmented since the war? This is answered in the negative by a load of debt, and the declension of trade. At all times must a southern confederacy support ships of war, and soldiery. As soon would a navy move from the forest, and an army spring from the earth, as such a confederacy, indebted, impoverished in its commerce, and destitute of men, could, for some years at least provide an ample defence for itself. Let it not be forgotten, that nations, which can inforce their rights, have large claims against the United States, and that the creditor may insist on payment from any one of them. Which of them would probably be the victim? The most productive and the most exposed. When vexed by reprisals or war, the southern states will sue for alliances on this continent or beyond sea. If for the former, the necessity of an union of the whole is decided. If for the latter, America will, I fear, react the scenes of confusion and bloodshed, exhibited among most of those nations, which have, too late, repented the folly of relying on auxiliaries. Two or more confederacies cannot but be competitors for power. The ancient friendship between the citizens of America, being thus cut off, bitterness and hostility will succeed in its place. In order to prepare against surrounding danger, we shall be compelled to vest somewhere or other power approaching near to a military government. The annals of the world have abounded so much with instances of a divided people, being a prey to foreign influence, that I shall not restrain my apprehensions of it, should our union be torn asunder. The opportunity of insinuating it will be multiplied in proportion to the parts, into which we may be broken. In short, sir, I am fatigued with summoning up to my imagination the miseries, which will harrass the United States, if torn from each other, and which will not end, until they are superseded by fresh mischiefs under the yoke of a tyrant. I come therefore to the last and perhaps only refuge in our difficulties, a consolidation of the union, as far as circumstances will permit. To fulfil this desirable object, the constitution was framed by the Fœderal Convention. A quorum of eleven states, and the only member from a twelfth have subscribed it;7 Mr. Mason of Virginia, Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts and myself having refused to subscribe. Why I refused, would, I hope, be solved to the satisfaction of those, who know me, by saying that a sense of duty commanded me thus to act. It commanded me, sir, For believe me, that no event of my life ever occupied more of my reflection. To subscribe seemed to offer no inconsiderable gratification; since it would have presented me to the world, as a fellow-labourer with the learned and zealous statesmen of America. But it was far more interesting to my feelings, that I was about to differ from three of my colleagues; one of whom is, to the honor of the country, which he has saved, imbosomed in their affections, and can receive no praise from the highest lustre of language; the other two of whom have been long inrolled among the wisest and best lovers of the commonwealth; and the unshaken and intimate friendship of all of whom I have ever prized, and still do prize, as among the happiest of all my acquisitions. I was no stranger to the reigning partiality for the members, who composed the convention; and had not the smallest doubt, that from this cause, and from the ardor for a reform of government, the first applauses at least would be loud, and profuse. I suspected too, that there was something in the human breast, which for a time would be apt to construe a temperateness in politicks into an enmity to the union. Nay I plainly foresaw, that in the dissensions of parties, a middle line would probably be interpreted into a want of enterprize and decision. But these considerations, how seducing soever, were feeble opponents to the suggestions of my conscience. I was sent to exercise my judgment, and to exercise it was my fixed determination; being instructed by even an imperfect acquaintance with mankind, that self approbation is the only true reward, which a political career can bestow, and that popularity would have been but another name for perfidy, if to secure it, I had given up the freedom of thinking for myself. It would have been a peculiar pleasure to me, to have ascertained, before I left Virginia, the temper and genius of my fellow-citizens, considered relatively to a government, so substantially differing from the confederation, as that, which is now submitted. But this was for many obvious reasons impossible: and I was thereby deprived of what I thought the necessary guides. I saw however that the confederation was tottering from its own weakness, and that the sitting of the convention was a signal of its total insufficiency. I was therefore ready to assent to a scheme of government, which was proposed, and which went beyond the limits of the confederation, believing, that without being too extensive it would have preserved our tranquility, until that temper and that genius should be collected. But when the plan which is now before the General Assembly, was on its passage through the convention, I moved, that the state-conventions should be at liberty to amend, and that a second general Convention should be holden to discuss the amendments, which should be suggested by them. This motion was in some measure justified by the manner, in which the confederation was forwarded originally, by Congress to the state-legislatures, in many of which amendments were proposed, and those amendments were afterwards examined in Congress.8 Such a motion was doubly expedient here, as the delegation of so much more power was sought for. But it was negatived. I then expressed my unwillingness to sign. My reasons9 were the following. 1. It is said in the resolutions, which accompany the constitution,10 that it is to be submitted to a convention of Delegates, chosen in each state by the people thereof, for their assent and ratification. The meaning of these terms is allowed universally to be, that the Convention must either adopt the constitution in the whole, or reject it in the whole, and is positively forbidden to amend. If therefore I had signed, I should have felt myself bound to be silent as to amendments, and to endeavor to support the constitution without the correction of a letter. With this consequence before my eyes and with a determination to attempt an amendment, I was taught by a regard for consistency not to sign. 2. My opinion always was, and still is, that every citizen of America, let the crisis be what it may, ought to have a full opportunity to propose through his representatives any amendment, which in his apprehension tends to the public welfare—By signing I should have contradicted this sentiment. 3. A constitution ought to have the hearts of the people on its side. But if at a future day it should be burthensome, after having been adopted in the whole, and they should insinuate, that it was in some measure forced upon them, by being confined to the single alternative of taking or rejecting it altogether, under my impressions and with my opinions I should not be able to justify myself had I signed. 4. I was always satisfied, as I have now experienced, that this great subject, would be placed in new lights and attitudes by the criticism of the world, and that no man can assure himself, how a constitution will work for a course of years, until at least he shall have heard the observations of the people at large. I also fear more from inaccuracies in a constitution, than from gross errors in any other composition; because our dearest interests are to be regulated by it, and power, if loosely given, especially where it will be interpreted with great latitude, may bring sorrow in its execution. Had I signed with these ideas, I should have virtually shut my ears against the information, which I ardently desired. 5. I was afraid, that if the Constitution was to be submitted to the people, to be wholly adopted or wholly rejected by them, they would not only reject it, but bid a lasting farewell to the union. This formidable event I wished to avert, by keeping myself free to propose amendments, and thus, if possible, to remove the obstacles to an effectual government. But it will be asked, whether all these arguments were not well weighed in Convention. They were, sir, and with great candor. Nay, when I called to mind the respectability of those, with whom I was associated, I almost lost confidence in these principles. On other occasions I should chearfully have yielded to a majority; on this the fate of thousands, yet unborn, enjoined me not to yield, until I was convinced— Again may I be asked, why the mode pointed out in the Constitution for its amendment, may not be a sufficient security against its imperfections, without now arresting it in its progress?—My answers are, 1. that it is better to amend, while we have the Constitution in our power, while the passions of designing men are not yet enlisted and while a bare majority of the states may amend, than to wait for the uncertain assent of three fourths of the states. 2. That a bad feature in government becomes more and more fixed every day. 3. That frequent changes of a Constitution even if practicable ought not to be wished, but avoided as much as possible: and 4. That in the present case it may be questionable, whether, after the particular advantages of its operation shall be discerned, three fourths of the states can be induced to amend. I confess, that it is no easy task, to devise a scheme which shall be suitable to the views of all. Many expedients have occurred to me, but none of them appear less exceptionable than this: that if our Convention should choose to amend, another federal Convention be recommended: that in that federal Convention the amendments proposed by this or any other state, be discussed; and if incorporated in the constitution or rejected, or if a proper number of the other states should be unwilling to accede to a second Convention, the constitution be again laid before the same state-conventions, which shall again assemble on the summons of the Executives, and it shall be either wholly adopted, or wholly rejected, without a further power of amendment. I count such a delay, as nothing in comparison with so grand an object; especially too as the privilege of amending must terminate after the use of it once. I should now conclude this letter, which is already too long, were it not incumbent on me from having contended for amendments, to set forth the particulars, which I conceive to require correction. I undertake this with reluctance; because it is remote from my intentions to catch the prejudices or prepossessions of any man. But as I mean only to manifest, that I have not been actuated by caprice, and now to explain every objection at full length would be an immense labour, I shall content myself with enumerating certain heads, in which the constitution is most repugnant to my wishes. The two first points are the equality of suffrage in the Senate, and the submission of commerce to a mere majority in the legislature,11 with no other check than the revision of the President. I conjecture that neither of these things can be corrected; and particularly the former; without which we must have risen perhaps in disorder. But I am sanguine in hoping, that in every other, justly obnoxious clause, Virginia, will be seconded by a majority of the states. I hope, that she will be seconded 1. in causing all ambiguities of expression to be precisely explained: 2. in rendering the President ineligible after a given number of years: 3. in taking from him either the power of nominating to the judiciary offices, or of filling up vacancies which therein may happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session: 4. in taking from him the power of pardoning for treason, at least before conviction: 5. in drawing a line between the powers of Congress and individual states; and in defining the former; so as to leave no clashing of jurisdictions nor dangerous disputes: and to prevent the one from being swallowed up by the other, under the cover of general words, and implication: 6. in abridging the power of the Senate to make treaties the supreme laws of the land: 7. in providing a tribunal instead of the Senate for the impeachment of Senators: 8. in incapacitating the Congress to determine their own salaries: and 9. in limiting and defining the judicial power. The proper remedy must be consigned to the wisdom of the convention: and the final step, which Virginia shall pursue, if her overtures shall be discarded, must also rest with them. But as I affect neither mystery nor subtilty, in politics, I hesitate not to say, that the most fervent prayer of my soul is the establishment of a firm, energetic government; that the most inveterate curse, which can befal us, is a dissolution of the union; and that the present moment, if suffered to pass away unemployed, can never be recalled. These were my opinions, while I acted as a Delegate; they sway me, while I speak as a private citizen. I shall therefore cling to the union, as the rock of our salvation, and urge Virginia to finish the salutary work, which she has begun. And if after our best efforts for amendments they cannot be obtained, I scruple not to declare, (notwithstanding the advantage, which such a declaration may give to the enemies of my proposal,) that I will, as an individual citizen, accept the constitution; because I would regulate myself by the spirit of America.12 You will excuse me, sir, for having been thus tedious. My feelings and duty demanded this exposition: for through no other channel could I rescue my omission to sign from misrepresentation, and in no more effectual way could I exhibit to the General Assembly an unreserved history of my conduct. I have the honor, Sir, to be, with great respect, your most obedient servant, EDMUND RANDOLPH. The Honorable the Speaker of the House of Delegates."
Letter,Yes,Edmund Randolph,James Madison,,,12/27/1787,"My dear friend Altho’ many mails have passed since I wrote to you last, I am not without excuses of a satisfactory nature which are too long and unimportant to you to hear in detail. Having shaken off the impediments to writing, I shall be hereafter punctual. My letter is now inclosed to you. What the general opinion is, I would not undertake to vouch because I stay much at home, and I find daily reason to distrust reports, which always receive a tincture from the wishes of the narrator. But I rather suspect, that the current sets violently against the new constitution. Nay I must be permitted to express a fear, lest true fœderalism should be pressed hard in the convention—General Wilkinson2 from Kentucke, who is now here, is not to be appeased in his violence against the constitution; and it is presumed that thro his means the vote of Kentucky will have the same direction. He is rivatted by Colo. Harry Lee,3 declaring to him, that the surrender of the Mississippi would probably be among the early acts of the new congress.—Mr. Meriwether Smith moved yesterday for a circular letter from our to the other legislatures, intimating the likelihood of amendment here. But his motion was changed into an instruction to the executive to forward the late act.4 Mr Henry is implacable. Colo Mason seems to rise beyond his first ground. He will be elected, it is said, for Stafford, and Colo. Mercer, it is also said, will be sent for by the people of that county for a similar purpose.5 I need not assure you, that it would give me no pleasure to see my conduct in refusing to sign, sanctified, if it was to produce a hazard [276]to the union; and if I know myself, I have no extreme ardor to acquire converts to my opinions. But I verily believe, that the only expedient which can save the fœderal government in any shape in Virginia, will be the adoption of some such plan, as mine. However the high-toned friends to the constitution are still very sanguine, that the whole will run thro with ease.…"
Letter,Yes,,,Freeman's Journal,,1/2/1788,"Extract of a letter from a gentleman at Washington Court-House, near Holstein,2 Virginia, to his friend in this city. “Here I expected to be happily removed from the din of politics, but even in these remote wilds the people are deeply engaged in that science. The new Constitution is the subject of universal discussion. A general dissatisfaction with the proceedings of the late Convention prevail here. So much disappointed in their expectations are the people, [284]that they think it more eligible to revert to the tyranny of Britain than bow the neck to domestic tyrants.”"
Newspaper,No,Tamony,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,1/9/1788,"To the FREEHOLDERS of AMERICA. When important subjects demand discussion, they ought to be treated with coolness and moderation, reason should be alone appealed to, and meet no interruption from passion or prejudice. Those who contend for the new Constitution without amendment think differently, or must condemn their own assertions, for in place of ascertaining how natural rights are secured, or government prudently restrained, they continually exclaim in a tone that assumes authority, “rejection must precipitate into the gulphs of destruction,—adoption leads to national happiness and dignity—men whose fortunes are involved may dread an effective administration and join those who under a federal system, would lose an importance dearer to them, than the welfare of their country.” Listen Americans, with caution to declamatory invective, patriotism scorns such language, and recoils from the idea of inflaming prejudice to reduce reflection, the interest of your country requires mental exertion, joined to a manly firmness, that may be compared to the steadiness of time, rises superior to the keenness of death. Such sentiments exalt human nature, they have acquired one glorious revolution, and must be banished from your breasts, before you can embrace a Constitution, which does not secure a minority of the [287]states, from local oppression, is open to the encroachments of aristocracy, the ambition of an individual. Happily for America the enlightened wisdom of a Virginia Assembly, has empowered their constituents, to investigate the truth or falsehood of the above assertions, by enacting that their Convention should proceed to a full discussion, and be freed from those fetters artifice wished to impose, under the specious pretence, of confining debate within the compass of absolute rejection or adoption.2 The extent thus opened for speculative enquiry, joined to real magnitude in the object, may be styled by enthusiasm or horizon, the eyes of few mens understanding can steadily behold the expression, though poetically just, reduced to common sense, means importance, and instead of superseding the duty incumbent on freeholders to judge for themselves, renders the neglect of doing so, treason against their country. What man capable of enjoying that liberty Divine Providence gives a common inheritance to mankind, will at such a crisis restrain his mental faculties from examining a temple built by men equally mortal with himself, for the residence of constitutional freedom, despotism may enjoin a silent reverence, free governments command enquiry, and owe existence to that animation enquiry creates. That citizen who feels and avows such a maxim, need not apologize for collecting the following observations on the fœderal fabric. Force seems its ruling principle—Forts and garrisons are provided for, a standing army must follow, the celebrated Doctor Price thus addresses Americans, “God forbid that standing armies should ever find an establishment in America, they are every where the grand support of arbitrary power and the chief source of the depression of mankind, no wise people will trust their defence out of their own hands, or consent to hold their rights at the mercy of armed slaves.”3 The office of president is treated with levity and intimated to be a machine calculated for state pageantry—Suffer me to view the commander of the fleets and armies of America, with a reverential awe, inspired by the contemplation of his great prerogatives, though not dignified with the magic name of King, he will possess more supreme power, than Great Britain allows her hereditary monarchs, who derive ability to support an army from annual supplies, and owe the command of one to an annual mutiny law.4 The American President may be granted supplies for two years, and his command of a standing army is unrestrained by law or limitation. As to supplies, the term may be shortened; but such a measure implying want of confidence in the first magistrate, will probably be postponed till the hour of danger arrives, and commonwealths be [288]exposed to that hazardous situation, emphatically called death bed repentance. Expectation from such a source may be deemed visionary, and reflection must compel even hope to confess, a mutiny law must owe existence to a general Convention, as the mode prescribed by article the 5th—for the president being by the people made commander of an army, is not subject in that command to a legislative body. Pause America—suspend a final affirmation, till you contemplate what may ensue—Do not contemn the declarations of Locke, Sydney, Montesquieu, Raynal, whose writings are legacies to the present and future ages, they unite in asserting that annual supplies and an annual mutiny law, are the chief dykes man’s sagacity can raise against that torrent of despotism, which continually attempts to deluge the rights of individuals. You are told impeachment will stem the flood, a legislative body, sixty five in number, are to march in formidable array, to a tribunal of twenty-six, and summons the commander of an army sworn to obey him—the event can be foreseen without suspicion of second sight, for anticipation may with confidence announce, that the bauble of a mace, hazarded in the mouth of a mortar, would be speedily conveyed, to that “bourn from whence no traveller returns.”5 Had the Constitution said, the president can do no wrong, nor shall he be re-elected—corruption in the man, might be guarded against by that rotation, which inculcates the idea of certain dissolution, and a council answerable to the people for consenting to, or advising measures, would cautiously give their sanction to a ruler whose official shield, must inevitably revert to dust. Virginia, Dec. 20, 1787."
Letter,No,William Russel,William Fleming,,,1/25/1788,"It afforded me, much pleasure, to be informed by Mr. Stewart, that you, & Mrs. Fleming, were well; and, afforded equal pleasure to Mrs. Russell. I have long wished for a line from you, and have, as long neglected to claim the right. But sir, calling to mind our long and happy acquaintance, I am emboldened, at this critical juncture (when the sentiments of our Nation seam so greatly devided, on the new plan of Government) to ask, that your wẽl grounded judgement on government, be given to me, thereupon; which will, no doubt be satisfactory to many others in this quarter, besides my self. Having matured my thoughts upon it, confess I am much alarmed, & am prone to think (although it is a production of much genius, yet, it demands the closest attention of every friend to our Country; or it may prove an enjine of destruction to the liberties, we have been so long [– – –] contending for, & at length acquired, at vast espence of blood & treasure. The first article giving powers to Congress legislatively; & 8th. article [i.e., section] refining these powers, yeild to Congress the sole power to lay & collect taxes &C, to borrow money, to regulate commerce, to constitute tribunals to define & punish piracies, to declare war, to raise & support armies, to provide & support a Navy, to call forth the Militia, & to be abosolute over all Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock [324]yards & other needful building thereunto belonging;—together with a variety of other powers; must, I think require the utmost circumspection, whether these powers are dangerous or not. And next, please examine the following Article—(“And to make laws that shall be necessary & proper, for carrying into execution the foregoing powers; & all other powers vested by this constitution; in the government of the United States; or in any department or offices thereof”) to which, I think, you will readily say, that no power is reserved or withheld from Congress. It seams to me, if Congress, have a right to make all laws that may be necessary & proper, that no inferiour Legislature, can be more than a Mitaphysical nothing. It must be evident, that only force under the new constitution can dictate to Congress; which is a misery every good man wood wish to escape. The late President has wisely observed. “It may be said that the new Legislature may provide remedies; but as they may so they may not, & if they did, a succeeding assembly may repeal the provision, & adds, the evil is founded resting upon constitutional bottomn, & the remedy upon the mutable ground of legislation, & revocable at any annual meeting.”2 Time at present, wont allow me, or my mind might be enlarged on, my fears of the Constitution without amendments; but, am encouriaged from the judicious remarks so many able pens have pointed out, that the people will behold the danger eer it be too late, & make choice of men for, the Conventions of the different States; whom, the hand of Providence, may direct, to wholesome amendments, upon the most permanent basis.3 I shall now rest my sentiments, hoping shortly for your better judgement, to aid your friend, & the good people of this country, in so important an object. I think but few here understand it yet. We lately heard from Mrs. Christian, all well there; as are Mr. Madisons4 family."
Newspaper,No,Civis Rusticus,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,1/30/1788,"To Mr. DAVIS. The following “objections to the Constitution of Government formed by the Convention,” are stated to be Col. Mason’s.3 I shall remark on them with that freedom which every person has a right to exercise on publications, but, with that deference, which is due to this respectable and worthy gentleman; to whose great and eminent talents, profound judgment, and strength of mind, no man gives a larger credit, than he, who presumes to criticise his objections—these, falling from so great a height, from one of such authority, may be supposed, if not taken notice of, to contain arguments unanswerable—not obtruding themselves on my mind in that forcible manner, I submit to the decision of the public, whether, what is now offered, contain declamation or reason; cavil, or refutation. 1st. “There is no declaration of rights; and the laws of the general government being paramount to the laws and constitutions of the several states, the declarations of rights in the separate states are no security. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoyment of the benefits of the common law, which stands here upon no other foundation than its having been adopted by the respective acts forming the constitutions of the several states. 2d. In the house of representatives there is not the substance, but the shadow only of representation; which can never produce proper information in the legislature, or inspire confidence in the people; the laws will therefore be generally made by men little concerned in, and unacquainted with their effects and consequences.4 3d. The senate have the power of altering all money bills, and of originating appropriations of money and the salaries of the officers of their own appointment, in conjunction with the president of the United States; although they are not the representatives of the people, or amenable to them. These, with their other great power (viz. their power in the appointment of ambassadors and other public officers, in making treaties, and in trying all impeachments) their influence upon and connection with the supreme executive from these causes, their duration of office, and their being a constant existing body almost continually sitting, joined with their being one complete branch of the legislature, will destroy any balance in the government, and enable them to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and liberties of the people. 4th. The judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended as to absorb and destroy the judiciaries of the several states; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive, and justice [333]as unattainable by a great part of the community, as in England, and enabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. 5th. The president of the United States has no constitutional council (a thing unknown in any safe and regular government) he will therefore be unsupported by proper information and advice, and will be generally directed by minions and favorites—or will become a tool to the senate—or a council of state will grow out of the principal officers of the great departments; the worst and most dangerous of all ingredients for such a council in a free country: For they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive measures, to shelter themselves and prevent an enquiry into their own misconduct in office; whereas had a constitutional council been formed (as was proposed) of six members, viz. two from the eastern, two from the middle, and two from the southern states, to be appointed by vote of the states in the House of Representatives, with the same duration and rotation in office as the senate, the executive would always have had safe and proper information and advice, the president of such a council might have acted as vice-president of the United States, pro tempore, upon any vacancy or disability of the chief magistrate, and long continued sessions of the senate would in a great measure have been prevented. From this fatal defect of a constitutional council has arisen the improper power of the senate in the appointment of public officers, and the alarming dependance and connection between that branch of the legislature and the supreme executive. 6th. Hence also sprung that unnecessary and dangerous officer the vice-president, who for want of other employment is made president of the senate: Thereby dangerously blending the executive and legislative powers; besides always giving to some one of the states an unnecessary and unjust pre-eminence over the others.—The president of the United States has the unrestraining power of granting pardons for treason; which may be sometimes exercised to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt. 7th. By declaring all treaties supreme laws of the land, the executive and the senate have, in many cases, an executive5 power of legislation, which might have been avoided by proper distinctions with respect to treaties, and requiring the assent of the house of representatives where it could be done with safety. 8th. By requiring only a majority to make all commercial and navigation laws, the five southern states (whose produce and circumstances are totally different from that of the eight northern and eastern states) will be ruined; for such rigid and premature regulations may be made, [334]as will enable the merchants of the northern and eastern states not only to demand an exorbitant freight, but to monopolise on the purchase of the commodities at their own price, for many years, to the great injury of the landed interest, and impoverishment of the people: And the danger is the greater, as the gain on one side will be in proportion to the loss on the other: Whereas requiring two thirds of the members present in both houses would have produced mutual moderation, promoted the general interest, and removed an insuperable objection to the adoption of the government. 9th. Under their own construction of the general clause at the end of the enumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in trade and commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual and severe punishments, and extend their power as far as they shall think proper; so that the state legislatures have no security for the powers now presumed to remain to them; or the people for their rights. 10th. There is no declaration of any kind for preserving the liberty of the press, the trial by jury in civil causes; nor against the danger of standing armies in time of peace. 11th. The state legislatures are restrained from laying export duties on their produce. 12th. The general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further importations of slaves for twenty odd years; though such importations render the United States weaker and more vulnerable, and less capable of defence. 13th. Both the general legislature and the state legislatures are expressly prohibited making expost facto laws; though there never was, nor can be a legislature but must and will make such laws, when necessity and the public safety require them; which will hereafter be a breach of all the constitutions in the union, and afford precedents for other invocations.6 This government will commence in a moderate aristocracy; it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in its operation produce a monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive aristocracy, it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate between the one and the other.” Ob. 1st. This objection proves too much, it goes against all sovereignty, “it being paramount to all laws of the several states, the declaration of rights in the separate states are no security,” if the declaration of rights in the separate states be no security, which it is confessed are not repealed, neither would a general declaration of rights be any security, for the sovereign who made it could repeal it; “the very title of sovereignty shews the absurdity of an irrevocable [335]law.” The people have every security of enjoying the benefits of the common law, and all acts of parliament previous to the fourth of James the first, they ever had—they remain unrepealed,7 and are the palladium of the rights of the people: as long as they retain the spirit of freedom, these rights will exist, amidst the mighty shock of revolutions, the crush of power, the fall of colonies, and the rise of empires. There are only five states in the union that have declarations of rights8—the proposed government is thoroughly popular—the house of representatives are immediately chosen by the people, the senate mediately by their representatives in Assembly, and the president by electors, in such manner as the legislature of the state may direct—at the end of four years, he may, and will be removed from his situation, unless he discharge the duties of it, to the approbation of the people, and to the glory and advantage of America. A government thus constituted stands in need of no bill of rights; the liberties of the people never can be lost, until they are lost to themselves, in a vicious disregard of their dearest interests, a sottish indolence, a wild licentiousness, a dissoluteness of morals, and a contempt of all virtue. 2d. “The house of representatives is not numerous enough,” and yet they exceed in number the present Congress:9 there was a time when these could acquire information, and why should not their successors? the number from this state will be ten, besides two senators; the number at present only five.—The reason of not augmenting the representation, I take to be this; the fear of augmenting the expences of government; and considering the condition of America, it is wise to pay a particular respect to this circumstance. 3d. “The senate have the power of altering money bills;” and why not? because the Lords in England, an hereditary aristocracy, have not, of late years, been permitted by the commons to exercise this power, shall the senate, a rotatory body, chosen by the representatives of the people, be deprived of this essential right of legislation? the people cannot be taxed, but, by the consent of their immediate representatives. They can fix no salaries without the consent and approbation of the president: Here they are checked; if we suppose both these bodies colluding, (which would at once demonstrate their wickedness and folly) and setting salaries at an infinitely exorbitant pitch, and above services; will not the house of representatives reclaim against such measures, and refuse all grants of money, ’till these are altered, and redressed? Of this truly respectable part of the constitution, in my idea, there is not the least ground for apprehension or fear: they cannot take their seats, ’till thirty years of age: the presumption is not a violent one, [336]that their integrity will be tried, and their abilities known and approved: most of them probably will be past, “the hey-day in the blood;”10 weaned from the intoxicating dissipation of youth, and the hot allurements of pleasure. 4th. The judiciary of the United States have original jurisdiction only, in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party—The convention has only crayoned the outlines, it is left to the Congress, to fill up and colour the canvas—To these able artists, the representatives of the states, the Wittenagemot of America11 (this task, the finishing of this piece) is left with great propriety—It is taken for granted by Mr. Mason that law will be rendered tedious and expensive, &c.—Let us pass over this begging of the question, and ask, what could this enlightened gentleman mean? by instancing England, as the place where justice is tedious and unattainable—“At the sittings in London and Middlesex there are not so few as eight hundred causes set down a year, and all disposed of; of these not more than twenty or thirty are ever afterwards heard of in the shape of special verdicts, special cases, &c.—Notwithstanding this immensity of business, it is notorious, that in consequence of method and a few rules, which have been laid down to prevent delay (even where the parties themselves would willingly consent to it) nothing now hangs in court—Upon the last day of the term there was not a single matter of any kind that remained undetermined” Burrow’s Rep. 4th vol. p. 2583.12 May justice in America be always attainable as in England, and may it be administered here precisely as it is administered at Westminster-Hall! The rich here, as in all other countries, will have an advantage over the poor, in all cases where the services of eminent and learned men are to be commanded by the influence of money. 5th. Had the convention left the executive power indivisible, I am free to own it would have been better, than giving the senate a share in it; or had they left the power to the president of appointing his own privy council, upon each of whom for every measure be advised and carried, responsibility should have been fixed, this blending of what should be separate would have been avoided—The following conjecture may explain the reason of this: A jealousy of executive government; and a jealousy in the minor states, which made them anxious to add every weight to the scale of the senate, considering it as the inexpugnable barrier of their privileges, and the soul of their existence. 6th. The powers of the vice-president do not strike me as dangerous; he will seldom or ever have that devolution of power by the death, resignation, or inability of the president; and, if he should, he will exercise it for a short time—The president’s having the unrestrained [337]power of pardoning for treasons is another objection; and why? “it may be sometimes exercised to screen from punishment those whom he, (the president) had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt”—I appeal to this worthy gentleman himself, I appeal to the public, whether there be in this objection, more of validity and force, or chimera and imagination. 7th. The infraction of the present treaty shews the necessity of treaties having the force of laws—When any publicity of them will not be injurious to America, they will be submitted to the representatives in Congress. The King of England can make peace or declare war; can make treaties, but, whenever the Commons disapprove of the measures by which these have been brought about, we know the consequences—Col. Mason is too well read in parliamentary history, not to know what the effects would have been, had the Commons frowned on those of Hanover, Seville, &c. negociated in the administration of Sir Robert Walpole—The cast of the proposed constitution is surely more popular than the English. 8th. Our interest is variant, not opposite; different from, not contrary to, that of the eastern states: I confess, on this point I have had my fears: as a Virginian, it would be more to my mind not to have the possibility of restraint imposed on the free transport of our staple, but, as an American I would submit this to the general sense, rather than secede—If, as I believe, for I will not assert, the agricultural system in Pennsylvania prevail over the commercial, we need not fear monopolies in the carrying business, restrictions, and navigation acts. I believe too, but I will not assert, be this as it may,—that the representative Congress of the United States will not, in fifty years, make so large a sacrifice of the trade of Virginia on the altar of selfishness and monopoly, as her assembly has made of it, in four, on the altar of ignorance and absurd prejudice. 9th. The latter part of the answer to the 6th objection may suffice for this—Valeat quantum valere potest.13 10th. “No declaration of the liberty of the press.” Our Bill of Rights declares, and it is not repealed, that the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of the liberty of the people, and never can be restrained, but by despotic power.14 The people of England have no other security for the liberty of the press, than we have—Their own spirit, and an act of parliament—their act of parliament may be repealed—our Bill of Rights may be repealed. Of that no man has any fear, of this no man need have, while this spirit is in the people—“This peculiar privilege must last (says a learned writer) as long as our government remains, in any degree, free and independent—it is seldom [338]that liberty of any kind is lost at once—slavery has so frightful an aspect to men accustomed to freedom, that it must steal upon them by degrees, and disguise itself in a thousand shapes in order to be received—But, if the liberty of the press ever be lost, it will be lost at once.—The general laws against sedition and libelling are at present as strong as they can possibly be made, nothing can impose a further restraint, but, either clapping an imprimatur on the press, or giving to the court very large discretionary powers, to punish whatever displeases them—but these concessions would be such a bare faced violation of liberty, that they will probably be the last efforts of a despotic government—Hume’s essay vol. 1. p. 17.”15 The last efforts of a despotic government! Can we then a popular government, a guaranteed republic, fear this more under the proposed, than the present constitution? A standing army without the consent of the representatives of the people in Congress there never can be: to their wisdom and their discretion we submit—Necessity may oblige America to raise an army—and who can judge of this necessity so well as Congress? Where can this power be more safely reposed? Dr. Smith (in his “Wealth of Nations,” book 5. ch. 1.)16 is of opinion in some cases, that a standing army is not dangerous to liberty—of this the people of America will judge, and a people jealous of their liberty, vigiliant over executory magistracy, will oppose with their united voice this institution, when they discover its end to be usurpation and tyranny. 11th. Happy for Virginia, that this restraint is imposed. Laying duties on exports is the acme of impolicy, and has been the practice of our Assemblies. 12th. Not restraining for twenty years the importation of Africans will not effect us—This gives South-Carolina and Georgia that privilege, if it be their pleasure to avail themselves of it—Is not this objection, the excess of criticism? 13th. Ex post facto laws have ever been considered as abhorrent from liberty: necessity and public safety never can require them—“If laws do not punish an offender, let him go unpunished; let the legislature, admonished of the defect of the laws, provide against the commission of future crimes of the same sort—The escape of one delinquent can never produce so much harm to the community, as may arise from the infraction of a rule, upon which the purity of public justice, and the existence of civil liberty essentially depend”—Paeley’s Principles of Moral Philosophy, vol. 2. p. 234.17 Oc[tavo] Ed. 14th. The last objection does not call for any particular animadversion—What the government may terminate in depends on the people—let [339]them feel their importance, be alive to their own interests; elect those of the best abilities and character; keep a jealous eye over their representatives, and over judicial and executory magistracy; be disposed to reverence the authority of laws, yet active to detect and expose malversation and wrong measures: the proposed government will then, not only induce external consideration and respectability, but will have internal efficiency and permanence, and will ensure to the present and future generations, security of property, and peace, happiness, and liberty, the great end of political and civil society. I have now finished, what I proposed to observe on these objections, and trust no person will conclude my design has been to condemn this respectable gentleman for not putting his signature to the constitution; on the contrary, thinking as he did, I commend him—The man of abilities, firmness, and integrity will dare to think, to judge, and act for himself, his principles have not the pliancy of his gloves, neither has he his mind to make up at every revolution of an hour: authority with him is not the guide to truth, nor does infallibility rest in numbers—He has a surer monitor; his own judgment and the dictates of his conscience of such stern matter is, if I am rightly informed, the mind of Mr. Mason composed, never yielding itself up, when convinced of its rectitude, at the arbitrium of the popular breath, nor giving into opinions that are not its own. Dec. 29, 1787."
Letter,Yes,William Short,William Grayson,,,1/31/1788,"I recieved by Commodore Jones your agreeable letter of Nov. 10. & was prevented from answering it by the last packet by the Commodore’s having retained it in his possession by mistake, until it was too late. I cannot express to you Sir all my gratitude for the abundance of information contained in it on American matters. The observations which you make on the proposed constitution are such as appear perfectly reasonable to all thinking men on this side of the Atlantic. I confess to you my ideas of federal matters have been all turned topsy turvy by reading & [studying?] on the result of the federal convention. When I awake from a reverie I cannot help [but?] thinking it all a dream. I ask myself, is it possible that the Citizens of America should have made in three years larger strides towards a toleration of monarchical principles than it had been supposed possible they should have made in as many centuries? I am forced to answer myself in the affirmative—the proposed constitution, a great part of [what?] is written on it in the public papers combine to shew that it is so.—This alarms me Sir not so much for the present as for future generations. despotism will probably not venture to shew itself in all its terrors during our time; but if we go on from three Years to [five?] years as we have done lately, an able political calculator would have no difficulty in shewing us to what a degree we should have advanced by the next generation.—I turn & twist this matter every way in order that I may get one favorable, one consolatory view of the subject but it is all in vain.—I am forced to return to the same position—that is, that so desperate a remedy would not have been proposed, much less tolerated, but in a desperate case. and surely the case is sufficiently desperate when we consider that violent as the dose is, the best thing we can do is to swallow it: for I confess to you I see at present [no alternative to?] an acceptance of this constitution or a dissolution of the union. the former [is certainly?] to be preferred, & among a variety of reasons for this one particularly that [there remains yet?] some hope of the States changing the new constitution by degrees [shaping it as much as?] possible to what it ought to be. whereas in the other case of a dissolution no hope is left. Yesterday at three o’clock the edict for the toleration of non catholic religions (& of which you have probably heard a great deal) was en-registered by the Parliament of Paris, [one?] hundred votes for, fifteen against it.—It is thought this edict will do a great deal of political good to the Kingdom. it cannot fail to do good; but time alone can shew [343]us the quantum.—The majority by which it was approved shews the progress of information & the increase of good principles in this country—indeed in every part of Europe there seems unquestionably a progression towards the points of information & of liberty, so much to be desired. I wish the same could be said of our dear country—[There?] progression of late years has been certainly retrograde, & that to the astonishment of the truly philosophical part of the learned here.—You know among the learned there are two opinions respecting the human species relative to government. the one that they are capable of enjoying the purest degree of liberty, & that they were intended for it by the great author of all things—the other that nature never intended them for any thing more than a partial degree of liberty & that consequently the idea of a pure republic is a visionary idea.—Our country, Sir, was the great standard to which these disputants always refered.—consider what a victory the latter party has lately gained, by America herself declaring that no government can exist without a monarch; though he shall for a time be called a President.…"
Newspaper,No,A Plain Dealer,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/13/1788,"Mr. DAVIS, As you have the character of being a very independent printer, and as the time is yet at hand when the liberty of the press, and the free discussion of public measures, are considered as the first data of free government, I doubt not you will publish the following observation in your useful paper.—To know the head which dictated them can be of no use to the public, and will add no weight to the publication; being written by an obscure citizen, but anxiously wishing for the prosperity of this country. The author judges, that when the majesty of office is laid aside, and its possessor enters the lists as a writer, a signal is thereby given for free animadversion; yet such as is decent and respectful, and with which the freedom of the press should ever be dignified. P.D. [364 Mons parturiens et ecce nascilur mus.1 After a long and general expectancy of some dissertation on the subject of the proposed Fœderal Constitution, worthy the first magistrate of the respectable state of Virginia, a letter of his Excellency Governor Randolph, of Oct. 10, 1787, is at length presented to the public. Previous to the appearance of this letter, various opinions were prevailing in different parts of this country, respecting that gentleman’s real opinion on the subject of the said Constitution; and it became difficult, for many to conjecture how his Excellency would devise a middle course, so as to catch the spirit of all his countrymen, and to reconcile himself to all parties. It was not known to me, at least, that his Excellency felt an “unwillingness to disturb the harmony of the legislature” on this important subject; nor could I conceive that the sentiments of even the ablest man among us could “excite a contest unfavorable” to the fairest discussion of the question. On the other hand, I thought it right that the adversaries of the Constitution, as well as its favorers, should candidly avow their real sentiments, as early and decidedly as possible for the information of those who are to determine. It is true, his Excellency was prevented declaring his opinion sooner,” by motives of delicacy arising from two questions depending before the General Assembly, one respecting the Constitution, the other respecting himself;”2 but I am of opinion that during the pendency of a question concerning the Constitution, every information on that subject, is most properly to be adduced; and I did not know that the being, or not being, Governor of Virginia, (an office in a great degree nominal) was sufficient to deter, a real patriot, from speaking the warning voice of opposition, in behalf of the liberties of his country.3 The letter above-mentioned can derive no aid from panegyric, as to the brilliancy and elegance of its stile; for, unlike the threadbare discourses of other statesmen on the dry subject of government, it amuses us with a number of fine words. But, how shall I express my dislike of the ultimatum of his Excellency’s letter, wherein he declares “that if after our best efforts for amendments, they cannot be obtained, he will adopt the Constitution as it is.” How is this declaration reconcileable to a former opinion of his Excellency’s, expressed to the Hon. Richard H. Lee, and repeated by the latter gentleman in his letter, as printed in the public papers—“that either a monarchy or an aristocracy will be generated from the proposed Constitution.”4 Good God! how can the first Magistrate and Father of a free republican government, after a feeble parade of opposition, and before his desired plan of [365]amendments has been determined upon, declare that he will accept a Constitution which is to beget a monarchy or an aristocracy? How can such a determination be reconciled to the feelings of Virginia, and to the principles which prevailed in almost every legislature in the union, who looked no farther than the amendment of our present republican confederation? I have charity to believe that the respectable characters who signed this Constitution, did so, thinking that neither a monarchy nor an aristocracy would ensue, but that they should thereby preserve and meliorate the republic of America: but never until now, that his Excellency has let the cat out of the bag, did I suppose, that any member of the Convention, at least any from the republican state of Virginia, would accept a Constitution, whereby the republic of his Constituents is to be sacrificed in its infancy, and before it has had a fair trial. But his Excellency will adopt this Constitution, “because he would regulate himself by the Spirit of America:[”]—But is his Excellency a prophet as well as a politician? Can he foretel future events? How else can he at this time discover what the spirit of America is? But admitting his infallibility for a moment, how far will his principle carry him?—Why, that if the dominion of Shays, instead of that of the new Constitution, should be generally accepted, and become the spirit of America, his Excellency too, would turn Shayite!—and yet this question of the Constitution, is “one on which the fate of thousands yet unborn depends.” It is his Excellency’s opinion, as expressed in the aforesaid letter, that the powers which are acknowledged necessary for supporting the Union, cannot safely be entrusted to our Congress as at present constituted; and his main objection is “that the representation of the states bears no proportion to their importance.” This is literally true; but it is equally true of the senate of the proposed Constitution, which is to be an essential part of the legislature; and yet his Excellency will accept the latter, and not agree to invest the necessary powers in the former, although the above objection equally applies to both. Nay, I am inclined to believe that the injurious consequences of this unequal representation will operate more strongly under the new government—for under the present confederation the members of Congress are removable at the pleasure of their constituents;—whereas under the proposed Constitution, the only method of removing a wicked, unskilful, or treacherous senator, will be by impeachment before the senate itself, of which he is a member. These, Mr. Printer, are some of the inconsistencies, which even a slight observation of the above letter, will suggest. It is not my purpose to oppose now, or investigate the merits of the Constitution. This I leave to abler pens, and to the common sense of my countrymen. The [366]science of government is in itself simple and plain; and if in the history of mankind, no perfect government be found, let it be attributed to the chicane perfidy and ambition of those who fabricate them; and who are more or less in common with all mankind infected with a lust of power. It is however certainly not consistent with sound sense to accept a Constitution, knowing it to be imperfect; and his Excellency acknowledges the proposed one to have radical objections. A Constitution ought to be like Caesar’s wife, not only good; but unsuspected, since it is the highest compact which men are capable of forming, and involves the dearest rights of life, liberty and property. I fear his Excellency has done no service to his favorite scheme of amendments (and he too seems to be of the same opinion) by his very candid declaration at the end of his letter. Subtlelty and chicane in politics, are equally odious, and dishonorable; but when it is considered, that the present is not the golden age—the epoch of virtue, candor and integrity—that the views of ambitious and designing men are continually working to their own aggrandisement and to the overthrow of liberty, and that the discordant interests of thirteen different commonwealths are to be reconciled and promoted by one general government; common reason will teach us, that the utmost caution, secrecy, and political sagacity is requisite to secure to each the important blessings of good government. I shall now take my leave of his Excellency and the above-mentioned letter; declaring my highest veneration for his character, and abilities. And it can be no impeachment of the talents of any man who has not served a regular apprenticeship to politics, to say, that his opinions on an intricate political question are erroneous: For if, as the celebrated Dr. Blackstone observes, “in every art, occupation, or science, commercial or mechanical, some method of instruction or apprenticeship is held necessary, how much more requisite will such apprenticeship be found to be, in the science of government, the noblest and most difficult of any!”5"
Newspaper,No,A Virginian,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/13/1788,"A hint to the people called QUAKERS in Virginia Gentlemen, Have you considered the plan of the new Constitution? If you have, I think you certainly disapprove it, especially in two points. 1st. As it admits of the importation of slaves to America for a limited time; for admitting slavery to be justifiable, it would be very impolitic to allow of any more of the poor Africans to be brought amongst us; instead whereof, I think it would better become us all as men and Christians, to endeavor to release those already under our care from the grievous burthens they are labouring under, than to permit any more to be subjected to the like sufferings. 2dly. I think by the plan in its present form, the governors which are thereby to be set up at Philadelphia, will have it in their power to make war on any terms they please: If so, no doubt but they may point out the part every man shall take therein, or be liable to such fines and penalties as they may think proper to impose; therefore gentlemen, as you are principled against war, in case we should be so unhappy as to be again involved therein, to whom will you apply for indulgence on account of your religious scruples? Not to the Assembly of Virginia, from whom, as I lately heard a respectable member of your society say, you have experienced many favors;2 no, my friends, I apprehend our Assembly will not have the power of interfering in such matters, indeed, as I conceive, there will be but a mere shaddow of power left in the hands of our legislature in any respect. There are divers other parts of the plan very exceptionable in my humble opinion, by which you will be liable in common with other people to be very much affected. Now, although you are a peaceable people, and do not incline to meddle with the affairs of government, yet, I don’t see there can be any impropriety in your endeavoring to guard yourselves in time against such measures as may be likely at length to bring on you great impositions and cruel sufferings. February 4, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Republicus,,Kentucky Gazette,,2/16/1788,"Mr. Bradford. Please to publish the anexed hints, perhaps they may have a tendency to rouse the attention of some judicious person to discuss the subject more at large. ——pierce my vein. Take of the crimson stream meandering there, And chatechize it well. Apply your glass. Search now and probe it, if it be not blood Congenial with thine own.—    Cowper.2 So soon after the close of a bloody and distressing war, which we have sustained in defence of the liberties and indefeasible rights of mankind; during which those rights have been investigated with the utmost precision: it may, to some, seem a little extraordinary to resume so trite a subject: but as there is a prospect of an æra near approaching, big with events highly, very highly interesting to these western districts; and as it seems, that some, even of our leading characters, have been too much hurried to have given those subjects so much of their attention as they seem to have merited; or may have forgotten some of the features peculiar to the picture of liberty; I beg leave to hold up to public view, some of the outlines of the charming portrait, in order to attach my fellow citizens to the original form from whence they are taken: and add a few very plain observations on civil government. In [376]this I shall confine myself to civil liberty, and that natural liberty or freedom of mankind, in an unconnected state, (or as some say, in a state of nature) from whence it arises: and shall first enquire what this natural freedom is, it is obvious at first sight, that this is neither more nor less than a power of self government, a performance of all our actions agreable to our own will; or in plainer terms, it is a doing as we please; under the direction of reason, the great, primary, and never-ceasing law of nature. As long as any man does so he has a right to enjoy his person, life, and property, free from all molestation whatsoever; and were he able, even to repel the combined power of the world, in any attempt to deprive him of either; and on this is founded a right of equality: for as one mans right is limited to the enjoyment, and defence of his own property; so every other mans right extends to the same limits, but no further: for it is inconceivable that an individual can of right, enjoy any possible possession, or happiness any part of which another person or even community of men can have a right to deprive him of: or that any two or more individuals, can at the same time justly claim or possess an exclusive right to any thing whatsoever! for what I wholy and rightfully claim or enjoy, every other man is wholy and rightfully excluded of claiming, or enjoying by this great and primary law of nature, and this it is which establishes a perfect natural equality among mankind, and excludes all right of one man to govern or controul the rightful actions, or property of another in any case whatsoever; and an universal, and unerring observation of, and obedience to this law, is what we call rectitude, or moral virtue: which, where it prevails, necessarily precludes all civil government: which is only substituted in the room of the aforesaid natural law, where its principles are not duly attended to, or its sanctions appear too distant, or fe[e]ble. It is evident that all men act according to, or depart from this law of nature; in proportion as, on the one hand their reason, or on the other their passions and appetites, preponderate: but as universal observation assures us, that mankind are more generally actuated by their passions and appetites, than by their reason; something is necessary to restrain, controul, or at least to counteract those passions: hence the necessity of civil government; and on that necessity it originates: the lust of power, or of property, would stimulate the strong, or the artful, to [seize?] the persons, or properties of the weak, or the simple, and appropriate them to their own use, in contempt of the sacred law of nature. Hence mankind found it necessary to enter into solemn compacts of mutual defence, and security, and in those compacts, to establish certain rules, founded upon, or at least agreeable to, the universal reason of mankind, (the common [377]law of nature) to which they should all be equally subject; as their [they] rightfully, and originally were in their unconnected state, to that original law; and this only to secure to themselves that liberty, and those rights to which they as said above are all naturally, equally, and unalienably entitled. Thus it appears how civil government becomes a substitute for moral virtue: and that instead of infringing the rightful liberties of mankind, it tends to secure them: and by this criterion may every government be tried: that government which tends not to secure the lives, liberties and properties of every individual of the community, as far as the law of reason would have done, is unjust and iniquitious and merits not the name of civil government. I said above that civil government originates in necessity: I now add it originates with the people under that necessity. They form the compact, they prescribe the rules and they also enact them or delegate others to do it for them; who are indiscriminately, and in the proper sense of the word their servants and accountable to them and to them only how they execute those trusts: as really so as the man whom I employ for daily wages is accountable to me and to me only how he performs my business; and are therefore to be chosen by them, and that in a way perfectly consistent with the equality of their right; because if they have an equal natural right to legislative and executive power in all their different branches, which takes in all the powers that can exist in a state: none can have a right to exercise any of those powers, but by appointment or delegation: consequently those who are thus chose by them to the executive department are as really their representatives, as those similarly chosen to the legislative: This I think an observation of some consequence; all this power they are justly authorized to exercise and that in their own joint and equal right: for if at the time of entring into such compact, a compleat equality in point of right subsists; it ever ought to subsist as there can be no legitimate superior, or even co ordinate power, to destroy or diminish that equality. But it is not only necessary that government should be formed on principles of equal right; but also that those principles should be precisely delineated and guarantied by the most solemn sanctions. This if you please we will call a constitution. There should also be woven into the very texture of that constitution certain antidotes or preservatives against corruption or degeneracy, and care should be taken by every member of the community, that those antidotes be duly administred. Otherwise tho they may begin their career on a very fair plain, yet, it may at last terminate in a precipice, which they may never discover till it be too late to retract. And first the constitution should provide for a fair and equal representation. [378]That is that every member of the union have a freedom of suffrage and that every equal number of people have an equal number of representatives; for if the preceding sentiments are just, no man deprived of suffrage, ought (unless he voluntarily adopt it at least implicitly) to be under the controul or direction of such constitution, or any law made in consequence of it; it is no law to him[,] he is in respect of it, still in a state of nature: and without equality of numbers it would be unjust: for it is incontestible that if every man has an equal natural right to governing power, he has an equal right to every thing that represents it; and if we suppose for instance one district to contain one hundred inhabitants, and another a thousand: each entitled to send two representatives if we suppose the former to be only duly represented, then there will be nine hundred in the latter not represented at all; But this is so plain a case that it is only strange that it should ever have been controverted. But again it should provide against their holding those trusts for long terms. This would call into public service a greater variety of estimable characters; would beget an emulation who should serve their country the most essentially; and make it perhaps as fashionable a virtue to serve the interest of the public, as it has been formerly a vice to serve the private interest of some favorite family or worthless dependent. Besides, this is a security which the people owe to themselves, for the fidility of their servants; and perhaps the only good security they can have: add to this temporary intervals of ineligibility, that they may in a private capacity feel all the good and evil effects resulting from their administration; and be prevented from acquiring any influence, dangerous to the liberty of the community. Whoever doubts the utility of this provisionary measure let him just recur to the state of the British government under the triennial and septennial parliaments: and he will soon be satisfied. But it should also provide for its own stability and permanency: and that no law may ever come into existence the foundation of which is not found in those primary principles: as the constitution comes immediately from the people; so ought the laws to flow immediately from the constitution; it should like a circle circumscribe all legislative power as the legislat[i]ve ought to circumscribe the executive, and both take their form from the people as the great centre of all: it should with all the authority becoming the majesty of a free people from whence it proceeds command; hetherto shalt thou come but no further; for if it suffers itself to be broken in one instance, why not in a thousand; it becomes like a bubble, its existence is no more and the issue may be fatal. But lastly, and above all it should provide that no man or set of men whatsoever from within or without, should even possess a power of controul, suspension, or negation, either permanent, or temporary, on or over any resolves, acts, proceedings, or laws made by the people themselves, or their representatives: duly chosen as above: for whenever this happens, their liberty expires, they are under the direction of a will different from, and superior to their own: and though they may still have the privilege of nominating those who possess that power, it is only the poor and degrading privilege of pointing out, among many tyrannical masters, whose lash they will cho[o]se to feel. In short they are slaves[.] It has been disputed whether one house, or rather power of legislature, be more eligible, or rather to be chosen than two. I shall hazard a few random thoughts on that subject. And first, if an institution answers all the ends designed by the institutors, as well as any other institution, or plan could have done, or can do, there remains no possibility of its doing more; it is therefore perfect, if any thing is added it becomes a redundancy, consequently an imperfection. I hope it will not be denied, that a single legislative body, is capable of making laws, the perfection of those laws depend on the wisdom, virtue, and integrity of the legislature, but does it appear, that more wisdom, virtue, and integrity, will, or can possibly be found in two houses than in one, provided they consist of the same number, but more particularly of the same identical persons? No man will affirm this. But it may be said that a second house or senate, being generally fewer in number, do, by their separation acquire an influence which would have been lost, had the whole been incorporated in one house. I answer, perhaps it might not have been lost; it would no doubt sometimes so happen, that they, in conjunction with the minority in the other house would be able to set aside some bills, which for want of their assistance there, [would] have passed, this would have been a shorter, and easier way; and attended besides, with much less expence of time and money; and excepting in some such instances, all such influence ought to be lost: for in no instance ought the minority to govern the majority. Again, it is more simple: and it is a well known maxim that the simpler a machine is, it is the more perfect; the reason on which it is grounded is obvious; viz,. because it is the less liable to disorder, the disorder more easily discovered; and when discovered, more easily repaired and in no instance is this maxim more applicable than in the great machine of government. But say they there ought to be two houses, because there are two separate interests. I answer by denying that any community can possibly have any but one common public interest, that is, [380]the greatest good of the whole and of every individual as a part of that whole; but if it be private interest that is meant, I confess that there are not only two, but twenty and it may be more private interests in every government, and the same argument would prove that there ought to be twenty or indeed five hundred houses of legislature in each government: and by proving too much falls to the ground. But the grand argument of all, is that by being separate they have a power of checking some bills which would otherwise pass into laws and might be detrimental to society. Had not this argument been produced on the other side, I should certainly have produced it in favour of one house: however I ask is a minority in one house, properly entitled to over rule a majority in the other? Are they not as likely to check a good bill as a bad one? and has it not in fact often happened? Is it not as probable that the second house would lay some of their checks on a good bill which perhaps they had little considered as that the first, should pass a bad one, where it had originated and been thoroughly canvassed? But let us turn the argument over and take a view of the other side of it. The inconsistencies that attend the idea of two houses are innumerable. Take one, supposing them both our represe[n]tatives (tho’ it will be hard to prove them so) it makes their constituents to say in many instances by their representatives in one house, ‘this shall be a law’, by their representatives in the other with respect to the same bill; ‘This shall not be a law’. It impowers one body of men to enact statutes; and another to forbid their being carried into execution. It resembles a man putting forth his right hand to do some important business and then stretching forth his left hand to prevent it; but supposing them not our representatives at all, they have no business there, and all their mighty power of checking, is a mere farce. I am now come down to that period, which I proposed at my setting out; and ought not, it may be trouble the public any farther; however as I consider myself a free agent, and would have every other man not only to believe so of hims[e]lf but also to use every means to be and continue really so for ever; I intend in some future paper3 (if I continue in the same humour I am now in) to make some transient observations, on the constitution held out to the united states, by the continental convention, which I sincerely wish might in the mean time be done by some better hand. In the above hints, I have spoken my sentiments but their authority comes from their being the sentiments of a Locke a Sidney and of all the great and good names who have favoured the world with observations on this important subject: but what gives them the highest [381]possible dignity with me; I believe them to be the sentiments of reason itself: and which I remain under the conviction should a government arise, flowing from any other source and running in another channel; though I shall always submit to the laws of my country, with as much cheerfalness as I can; yet the voice of the united world shall never persuade me to say it is right."
Letter,No,William Fleming,Thomas Madison,,,2/19/1788,"Your favour of Jany 2d2 is before me. A trip to G.

Who will offer I know not. should the Voters choose me for one,3 I will serve them as I look on it to be my duty, and the last [years?] service I can render my Country, should I be rejected, it will give me no umbrage, it will be a pleasure to see members of superior abilities, and equal willingness, ready to serve the County—You desire me to write you my thoughts on the Constitution, and hint that I am against it. On my receiving a Copy of the Plan when first published to that before I had seen any thing pro or Con, on the Subject, I declared that poor Democracy was at the last gasp, Aristocracy was establishing, which I feard would end in Tyrannical Regality, this declaration has unjustly, perhaps stamp’d me with many, an Ante Confœdralist, I most heartily agree with you that the Union of the American states ought to be consolidated, and this force, power & energy of the Confederation be brought to point, this would give us weight with foreign Nations, and make us respectable in the political Scale of Europe, on the Contrary an independant Sovereignty in each state, will directly & immediatly produce sciens of blood amongst ourselves, & make us an easy prey to the first powerfull foreign invader, but can not the last inconvenience & the former advantage be obtained without depriving the Citizens of their priveleges? I think it may.—let me say it without the imputation of vanity, that I was pleased the letter from Mr Lee4 contained many of my private objections before I had seen it. I therefore refer you to that and at present shall only remove one objection you make in yours. Viz the Influence the President may have in Council the Members of his own choosing. May not this be obviated by the Members of the Privy Council being chosen by the Legislators of the diffrent States, from the above you will, see that I am for the Constitution with such amendments as will secure the liberty of the Subject, for of all Governments an Oligarchy is the worst, and power once parted with can never be reclaimed without bloodshed—I am in the same situation with respect to having the public prints that you are, I have not seen a paper since I came up from the River, and even in the small circle of Botetourt, the communication is interrupted from the Inhabitants at the Courthouse innoculating for the [384]small pox. Your Unckle Lewis and Jones,5 are strongly for the Confederation as new modeled. Mr Lewis I believe will offer for Rockingham, I have received a letter from the General6 on this subject which I will answer by this conveyance (which I expect will be by Mr G Nelson), and as The Tomahawk is burried between you, & the Tree of Peace planted, and in a fair way to flourish Green & Strong, You will see it—What occasion for an excuse for the length of Your letter? the longer the better, it supplies a tete a tete conversation. I am well pleased to hear, you have got a sufficiency of good water, for the making of Salt, and likely to shorten the process.—In your old habitation which looks like a deserted place, I found a small decanter with Sixteen ounces of Quicksilver as it was standing open to every one and would certainly be lost, last week I took it home for which I am accountable to you.—"
Letter,No,Harry Innes,John Brown,,,2/20/1788,"I returned late last evening from Fayette & found Mr. Lacasagne2 here on his way to Philadelphia. I have snatched up my pen to let you know that I am not altogether thoughtless of you; this letter should be more full but the bearer sets out early this morning & I am obliged to curtail it. I wrote you via Richmond very fully on the subject of your business & what I thought the Court would probably do at the March Term. I have nothing to add on that head but to assure you that everything in my power shall be done for the benefit of yours and your clients interest. The subject of the Federal Constitution begins to engross the attention [386]of the people & I am endeavoring to bring about a convention on that important subject big with the fate of Kentucky & the Western Country.3 The objections which have been generally made to the eastward are of a general nature and appear to affect the general interest of United America; they are of too much importance to be looked over. I need not repeat them here as they have often appeared in the Public Print, but my Dr. Sir. the adoption of that Constitution would be the destruction of our young & flourishing country which I shall endeavor to point out concisely to you, viz: All commercial regulations “are to be vested in the General Congress”. Our interests and the interests of the Eastern states are so diametrically opposite to each other that there cannot be a ray of hope left to the Western Country to suppose that when once that interest clashes we shall have justice done us. There is no such idea as justice in a Political society when the interests of 59/60 are to be injured thereby and that this will be the case as soon as we have the liberty of exportation, is self evident. Is there an article that the Eastern States can export except Fish oil & rice that we shall not abound in. I say not one. So long therefore as Congress hath this sole power & a majority have the right of deciding on those grand questions we cannot expect to enjoy the navigation of the Mississippi, but another evil equally great will arise from the same point. If ever we are a great and happy people, it must arise from our industry and attention to manufactories. This desirable end can never be brought about so long as the state Legislatures have the power of prohibiting imports, can we suppose that Congress will indulge us with a partial import when we must otherwise procure all our resources from the Eastward, the consequence of which is that we will be impoverished and the Eastern States will draw all our wealth and emigration will totally cease. The most particular objection is the power of the Judiciary if our separation takes place, there will probably arise disputes between the Citizens of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, & North Carolina and the Citizens of Kentucky; it is hardly to be supposed that each of the Citizens of these States as may have disputes with the Citizens of Kentucky will sue in Kentucky we shall be drawn away to the Federal Court and the Citizens from Kentucky away from their local habitations will nine times out of ten fall a sacrifice to their contests. there are with me three insurmountable objections to the New Constitution. I wish to see a convention of the people on the subject & to remonstrate against it through the convention of Virginia & if that cannot be done, at least to address. Our local situation must justify, [387]any measures which may be adopted upon this occasion, certain that if the Constitution is adopted by us that we shall be the mere vassals of the Congress and the consequences to me are horrible and dreadful. I would write more, but am obliged to conclude but before I lay down my pen must observe that the Indians continue hostile. 25 horses were taken in the latter end of January when the earth was covered 5 inches of snow. Will Congress do anything for us. Let us hear from you as soon as possible. Mr. Lacasagne will stay some time in Philadelphia & hath promised me to inform you of his lodgings, & to undertake to forward any letter you may send to his care. Mr. Al Parker of Lexington4 will leave Philadelphia the beginning of April. We have had a most severe winter, which is not ended. I know of no changes among your acquaintances here. We are all well."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/20/1788,"To the free people of Virginia. Countrymen and Fellow-Citizens, That the subject, which has given rise to the following observations, is of the highest consequence to this country, requires not the aid of logical proof; that it merits the most serious attention of every member of this community, is a fact not to be controverted. Will not a bare mention of the new Federal Constitution justify this remark? To foreigners or such, whose local connections form no permanent interest in America, this may be totally indifferent; and to them it may afford mere matter of speculation and private amusement. When such advert to the high and distinguished characters, who have drawn up, and proposed a set of articles to the people of an extensive continent as a form of their future government, an emotion of curiosity may induce them to examine the contents of those articles: and they may, perhaps, from having contemplated on a former situation of those people—that they had struggled against a potent enemy—that they had by their virtuous and patriotic exertions rescued themselves from impending danger—that they had used the like endeavors to establish for themselves a system of government upon free and liberal principles—that they had in pursuance of those endeavors [388]chosen a system, as conducive to the great ends of human happiness, the preservation of their natural rights and liberties—that this system has prevailed but a few years; and now already a change, a fundamental change therein is meditated:—strangers, I say, having contemplated on these circumstances, may be led to consider this nation, as a restless and dissatisfied people, whose fickle inconsistent minds suffer them not to abide long in the same situation; who perpetually seeking after new things throw away one blessing in pursuit of another: and while they are thus indulging their caprice—lose all, ere any can ripen into maturity. If the unconcerned part of those among us entertain themselves in this manner, can any good American be content to deserve such reflections? Will not all rather feel an honest indignation, if they once perceive their country stamped with a character like this? And yet, may we not justify such conceptions, if we thus precipitate ourselves into a new government before we have sufficiently tried the virtues of the old? So incident is error to the human mind, that it is not to be wondered at indeed, if our present Constitution is incomplete. The best regulated governments have their defects, and might perhaps admit of improvement: but the great difficulty consists in clearly discovering the most exceptionable parts and judiciously applying the amendments. A wise nation will, therefore, attempt innovations of this kind with much circumspection. They will view the political fabric, which they have once reared, as the sacred palladium of their happiness;—they will touch it, as a man of tender sensibility toucheth the apple of his eye,—they will touch it with a light, with a trembling—with a cautious hand,—lest they injure the whole structure in endeavoring to reform any of its parts. In small and trivial points alterations may be attempted with less danger; but—where the very nature, the essence of the thing is to be changed: when the foundation itself is to be transformed, and the whole plan entirely new modelled;—should you not hesitate, O Americans? Should you not pause—and reflect a while on the important step, you are about to take? Does it not behove you to examine well into the nature and tendency of the Constitution now proposed for your adoption? And by comparing it with your present mode of government, endeavor to distinguish which of the two is most eligible? Whether this or that is best calculated for promoting your happiness? for obtaining and securing those benefits, which are the great object of civil society? Will it be consistent with the duty, which you owe to yourselves, as a nation, or with the affection, which you ought to bear for your posterity, if you rashly or inconsiderately adopt a measure, which is to influence the fate of this country for ages yet to come? How will it accord with your dignity and reputation, [389]as an independent people, if either through an over-weaning fondness for novelty you are suddenly transported on the wings of imagination, and too hastily make up your thoughts on this great subject; or by sinking into a listless inactivity of mind, view it as an indifferent matter unworthy of any deliberate consideration? Will any respect? Will any honor? Will any veneration be due to the memory of yourselves, as ancestors, if millions of beings, who have not yet received their birth, when you are all mouldered into dust, should find themselves fixed in a miserable condition by one injudicious determination of your’s at this period? If you see no impropriety in these questions, the suggestions contained in them will not appear altogether unworthy of attention. One moment’s reflection, it is humbly presumed, will render it obvious that on this occasion they are not impertinently propounded. In pursuing this address I beg leave to premise that the only true point of distinction between arbitrary and free governments seems to be, that in the former the governors are invested with powers of acting according to their own wills, without any other limits than what they themselves may understand to be necessary for the general good; whereas in the latter they are intrusted with no such unlimited authority, but are restrained in their operations to conform to certain fundamental principles, the preservation whereof is expressly stipulated for in the civil compact: and whatever is not so stipulated for is virtually and impliedly given up. Societies so constituted invest their supreme governors with ample powers of exerting themselves according to their own judgment in every thing not inconsistent with or derogatory to those principles; and so long as they adhere to such restrictions, their deeds ought not to be rescinded or controuled by any other power whatsoever. Those principles are certain inherent rights pertaining to all mankind in a state of natural liberty, which through the weakness, imperfection, and depravity of human nature cannot be secured in that state. Men, therefore, agree to enter into society, that by the united force of many the rights of each individual may be protected and secured. These are in all just governments laid down as a foundation to the civil compact, which contains a covenant between each with all, that they shall enter into one society to be governed by the same powers; establishes for that purpose the frame of government; and consequently creates a Convention between every member, binding those, who shall at any time be intrusted with power, to a faithful administration of their trust according to the form of the civil policy, which they have so constituted, and obliging all to a due obedience therein. There can be no other just origin of civil power, [390]but some such mutual contract of all the people: and although their great object in forming society is an intention to secure their natural rights; yet the relations arising from this political union create certain duties and obligations to the state, which require a sacrifice of some portion of those rights and of that exuberance of liberty, which obtains in a state of nature.—This, however, being compensated by certain other adventitious rights and privileges, which are acquired by the social connection; it follows that the advantages derived from a government are to be estimated by the strength of the security, which is attended at once with the least sacrifice and the greatest acquired benefits. That government, therefore, which is best adapted for promoting these three great ends, must certainly be the best constituted scheme of civil policy. Here, then, it may not be improper to remark that persons forming a social community cannot take too much precaution when they are about to establish the plan of their government. They ought to construct it in such a manner as to procure the best possible security for their rights;—in doing this they ought to give up no greater share than what is understood to be absolutely necessary:—and they should endeavor so to organise, arrange and connect it’s several branches, that when duly exercised it may tend to promote the common good of all, and contribute as many advantages, as the civil institution is capable of. It has been before observed that the only just origin of civil power is a contract entered into by all the people for that purpose.—If this position be true (and, I dare presume, it is not controverted, at least in this country) right reason will always suggest the expediency of adhering to the essential requisites in forming that contract upon true principles. A cautious people will consider all the inducements to enter into the social state, from the most important object down to the minutest prospect of advantage. Every motive with them will have its due weight. They will not pay a curious attention to trifles and overlook matters of great consequence:—and in pursuing these steps they will provide for the attainment of each point in view with a care—with an earnestness proportionate to its dignity, and according as it involves a greater or a lesser interest. It is evident, therefore that they should attend most diligently to those sacred rights, which they have received with their birth, and which can neither be retained to themselves, nor transmitted to their posterity, unless they are expressly reserved: for it is a maxim, I dare say, universally acknowledged, that when men establish a system of government, in granting the powers therein they are always understood to surrender whatever they do not so expressly reserve. This is obvious from the very design of the civil institution, which is adopted in lieu of the state of natural liberty, wherein each [391]individual, being equally intitled to the enjoyment of all natural rights, and having equally a just authority to exercise full powers of acting, with relation to other individuals, in any manner not injurious to their rights, must, when he enters into society, be presumed to give up all those powers into the hands of the state by submitting his whole conduct to the direction thereof. This being done by every member, it follows, as a regular conclusion, that all such powers, whereof the whole were possessed, so far as they related to each other individually, are of course given up by the mere act of union. If this surrender be made without any reservation, the conclusion is equally plain and regular, that each and all have given up not only those powers, which relate to others, but likewise every claim, which pertained to themselves, as individuals. For the universality of the grant in this case must necessarily include every power of acting, and every claim of possessing or obtaining any thing—except according to the regulations of the state. Now a right being properly defined, “a power or claim established by law, to act, or to possess, or to obtain something from others,” every natural right is such power or claim established by the law of nature. Thus, it is manifest, that in a society constituted after this manner, every right whatsoever will be under the power and controul of the civil jurisdiction. This is the leading characteristic of an arbitrary government, and whenever any people establish a system like this, they subject themselves to one, which has not a single property of a free constitution. Hence results the necessity of an express stipulation for all such rights as are intended to be exempted from the civil authority. Permit me now, my country men, to make a few observations on the proposed Federal Constitution. In this attempt the subject, as it is arduous and difficult, naturally impresses the modest mind with diffidence: yet being of the last importance, as involving in it the highest interest, that freemen can have—all that is dear and valuable to the citizens of these United States; a consciousness of the strong claim, which this subject has, to a free and general discussion, has prevailed over that discouraging idea so far as to produce the present address to you. This is done with a reliance on that benevolence and liberality of sentiment, with which you have hitherto been actuated. From these benign qualities, it is hoped, the most favorable indulgence will be granted, and that the zeal, with which this is written, will be allowed in some measure an excuse for its defects. However imperfect, therefore this may be, however inadequate to your own ideas, or to the wishes of him, who offers it to your consideration; you are hereby intreated to let the perusal, with which you may think proper to favor [392]it, be serious, candid, dispassionate—as it relates to a common cause, in which all are alike concerned. Suffer me, then, in the first place to advert to a part of the sixth article in this constitution. It may, perhaps, appear somewhat irregular, to begin with this article, since it is almost the last proposed: yet, if it be considered that this at once defines the extent of Congressional authority, and indisputably fixes its supremacy, every idea of impropriety on this head will probably vanish. The clause alluded to contains the following words, “This constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary, notwithstanding.” If this constitution should be adopted, here the sovereignty of America is ascertained and fixed in the federal body at the same time that it abolishes the present independent sovereignty of each state. Because this government being general, and not confined to any particular part of the continent; but pervading every state and establishing its authority equally in all, its superiority will consequently be recognized in each; and all other powers can operate only in a secondary subordinate degree. For the idea of two sovereignties existing within the same community is a perfect solecism. If they be supposed equal, their operation must be commensurate, and like two mechanical powers of equal momenta counteracting each other;—here the force of the one will be destroyed by the force of the other: and so there will be no efficiency in either. If one be greater than the other, they will be similar to two unequal bodies in motion with a given degree of velocity, and impinging each other from opposite points;—the motion of the lesser in this case will necessarily be destroyed by that of the greater: and so there will be efficiency only in the greater. But what need is there for a mathematical deduction to shew the impropriety of two such distinct co-existing sovereignties? The natural understanding of all mankind perceives the apparent absurdity arising from such a supposition: since, if the word means anything at all, it must mean that supreme power, which must reside somewhere instate; or, in other terms, it is the united powers of each individual member of the state collected and consolidated into one body. This collection, this union, this supremacy of power can, therefore, exist only in one body. This is obvious to every man: and it has been very properly suggested that under the proposed constitution each state will dwindle into “the insignificance of a town corporate.” This certainly will be their utmost consequence; and, as such, they will have [393]no authority to make laws, even for their own private government any farther than the permissive indulgence of Congress may grant them leave. This, Virginians, will be your mighty, your enviable situation after all your struggles for independence! and, if you will take the trouble to examine, you will find that the great, the supereminent authority, with which this instrument of union proposes to invest the federal body, is to be created without a single check—without a single article of covenant for the preservation of those inestimable rights, which have in all ages been the glory of freemen. It is true, “the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government:” yet they do not guarantee to the different states their present forms of government, or the bill of rights thereto annexed, or any of them; and the expressions are too vague, too indefinite to create such a compact by implication. It is possible that a “republican form” of government may be built upon as absolute principles of despotism as any oriental monarchy ever yet possessed. I presume that the liberty of a nation depends, not on planning the frame of government, which consists merely in fixing and delineating the powers thereof; but on prescribing due limits to those powers, and establishing them upon just principles. It has been held in a northern state by a zealous advocate for this constitution that there is no necessity for “a bill of rights” in the federal government; although at the same time he acknowledges such necessity to have existed when the constitutions of the separate governments were established. He confesses that in these instances the people “invested the[i]r representatives with every power and authority, which they did not in explicit terms reserve:” but “in delegating federal powers,” says he, “every thing, which is not given, is reserved.”2 Here is a distinction, I humbly conceive, without a difference, at least in the present enquiry. How far such a discrimination might prevail with respect to the present system of union, it is immaterial to examine; and had the observation been restrained to that alone, perhaps it might be acknowledged to contain some degree of propriety. For under the confederation it is well known that the authority of Congress cannot extend so far as to interfere with, or exercise any kind of coercion on, the powers of legislation in the different states; but the internal police of each is left free, sovereign and independent: so that the liberties of the people being secured as well as the nature of their constitution will admit; and the declaration of rights, which they have laid down as the basis of government, having their full force and energy, any farther stipulation on that head might be unnecessary. But, surely, when this doctrine comes to be applied to the proposed [394]federal constitution, which is framed with such large and extensive powers, as to transfer the individual sovereignty from each state to the aggregate body,—a constitution, which delegates to Congress an authority to interfere with, and restrain the legislatures of every state—invests them with supreme powers of legislation throughout all the states—annihilates the separate independency of each; and, in short—swallows up and involves in the plenitude of its jurisdiction all other powers whatsoever:—I shall not be taxed with arrogance in declaring such an argument to be fallacious; and insisting on the necessity of a positive unequivocal declaration in favor of the rights of freemen in this case even more strongly than in the case of their separate governments. For it seems to me that when any civil establishment is formed, the more general its influence, the more extensive the powers, with which it is invested, the greater reason there is to take the necessary precaution for securing a due administration, and guarding against unwarrantable abuses."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,James Gordon Jr.,,,2/26/1788,"Captain Merry delivered me the letter that you were pleased to write me, on the 11th instant,2 in which I find you propose the following questions, relative to the new constitution, proposed by the late general convention, and request my answer to them: First. Whether the United States had not better receive than reject the said constitution? Secondly. Whether it would not injure our credit in the European world, if we were to dissent therefrom; and whether our country would not thereby be endangered, as there are large demands in Europe against us? Thirdly. Whether every objection to the plan may not, by instructions from the different states, be made as soon as the said Congress may be assembled? Fourthly. Whether ruin would await us, unless we are consolidated in one general plan of government? To the first question, namely, “Whether the United States,” &c. I answer, that this question implies a necessity of either adopting or rejecting. But I know of no power on earth that has, or ever had, a right to propose such a question of extremity to the people, or any part of the people, of the United States. The happiness or misery of mankind depends so essentially upon government, that, when this is to be established by the people for themselves and their posterity, the right of the people cannot be questioned, of so acting with plans proposed, as to adopt them, reject them, or propose amendments to them. To the second query, “Whether it would not injure,” &c. I reply, that this second question is much founded on the first; and, so far as it is, may receive the same answer. It is divisible into two parts; the first, shall our credit be injured in Europe by dissenting from the proposed plan? It is presumable, that credit abroad depends much upon union and happiness at home, as it must always greatly do upon that industry and real strength which grows out of the possession of civil liberty. Those, therefore, who contend for the new plan, by propounding such a question, should prove, in the first place, that the adoption of this constitution will secure union and happiness at home, and those valuable consequences that flow from the possession of civil liberty; and this is the more necessary, as there are such numbers who think that the proffered plan, if admitted without amendments, will empower the administrators of the new government to destroy civil liberty. The second part of this question is, [“]whether our country will not be endangered by a dissent, as there are large demands against us in Europe.” I presume that foreigners have no business with the nature of our government. Payment of their debts they are entitled to, but no possible reason can be assigned, why these debts may not as well be paid if the proposed constitution was to be so amended, as to secure the just rights and liberties of the people from violation, by a proper [419]bill of rights; to retain the trial by jury in all cases, civil as well as criminal, as directed by the common law; to secure the rights of conscience, and freedom of the press. Will France, Holland, or Spain, be disturbed at our retaining these valuable privileges? or, will they quarrel with us for so amending this new plan, as to put it out of the power of the new rulers to carry every citizen of the state, by way of appeal, to be tried for every suit for debt, brought by all others than our own state citizens, in the supreme federal court, where distance and expense may ruin multitudes? Have foreigners any thing to do with our amending the proposed constitution, so as to put it out of the power of the rulers under it, to garble elections, by ordering all the elections of any state to be held at any place they shall choose—at Cape Henry,3 for instance, if they so please at any time. See section fourth, article first, where they have power over time, place, and manner of holding elections for choosing representatives, without restraint or limitation. To the third query, “Whether every objection,” &c. I answer, that the constitution containing these objections, is made by the people of the United States; “and the removal of them by the Congress, would only be a common act of legislation, which may be revoked and repealed by every subsequent meeting of the Congress.[”] So that the power of oppressing will be founded on the strong and lasting ground of a constitution made by the people of the United States, and the remedies (if the new rulers should ever please to declare any,) will rest on feeble and changeable acts of a common legislature. Can it be safe or prudent to suffer this? As for instructions, it is to be remarked, that the senators are chosen by the legislature of the states, and the representatives by all the freeholders—to instruct one, and not both branches of the new legislature, would be doing nothing; and to render instructions of use, the general assembly, and the freeholders of the community, must unite. The almost impossibility of procuring such a union from the majority of the United States, is too obvious, not to show the very little dependence that should be put on such instructions. And, after all, the result could only be a legislative and mutable act against a fixed constitution. But how absurd would it be for the people to agree to a constitutional evil to-day and to-morrow call for a legislative redress of that evil! The fourth and last question, “Whether ruin would await us,” &c. I am clearly of opinion, that our greater strength, safety, and happiness, depends on our union; but I am as clear that this union had infinitely better be on principles that give security to the just rights and liberties of mankind, than on such principles as permit rulers to [420]destroy them. Thus, sir, I hope that I have fully, and to your satisfaction, answered your several questions: so that you may think yourself warranted, if not bound to be a friend to amendments that should be constitutional. To trust to future events for remedy of evils that we have ourselves once created, is like choosing to be sick, because a doctor may possibly cure us! A very capital defect in this new project is, that the executive and legislative powers are so blended and united, as to remove all chance for responsibility; and to possess man with very great powers, without making him easily answerable for an abuse of these powers, is, in my opinion, neither safe nor wise. I am glad to hear that Colonel Barbour4 stands for the convention. It is many years ago since I saw his conduct in the legislature, and observed it to be both sensible and honest. I have been obliged to write in haste, so that you may be sure this letter is not intended for the press."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/27/1788,"(Continued from our last.) Section 8th of the first article gives the Congress a power “to lay and collect, taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” If it be a true maxim that those, who are entrusted with the exercise of the higher powers of government, ought to observe two essential rules; first in having no other view than the general good of all without any regard to private interest; and secondly, to take equal care of the whole body of the community, so as not to favor one part more than another: it is apparent that under the proposed constitution, this general confederated society, made up of thirteen different states, will have very little security for obtaining an observance, either of the one, or of the other, rule. For being different societies, though blended together in legislation, and having as different interests; no uniform rule for the whole seems to be practicable: and hence, it is to be feared, that the general good may be lost in a mutual attention to private views. From the same causes we may lament the probability of losing the advantage of the second rule; for it may be expected, in like manner, that the general [421]care of the whole will be lost by the separate endeavors of different legislators to favor their own states. So long as mankind continues to be influenced by interest, the surest means of effecting an union of counsels in any assembly is by an union of interests. Now, if it be considered that it is this concert, that it is this union in promoting the general good, which alone can preserve concord in this great republic, and secure it success and glory,—unhappy will be the situation of America, if she once precludes the beneficial effects of such a good understanding. Yet, I apprehend that these evils may result in a great measure from an exercise of that branch of legislative authority, which respects internal direct taxation. For in this, it is scarcely probable that the interest, ease or convenience of the several states can be so well consulted in the federal assembly, as in their own respective legislatures. So different are many species of property, so various the productions, so unequal the profits arising, even from the same species of property, in different states, that no general mode of contribution can well be adopted in such a manner as at once to affect all in an equitable degree. Hence may arise disagreeable objects of contention. A diversity of interests will produce a diversity of schemes. Thus each state, as it is natural will endeavor to raise a revenue by such means, as may appear least injurious to its own interest: a source of dissention manifestly detrimental to that harmony, which is necessary to support the confederation. I cannot conceive it impracticable to reform the federal system in such a manner as to ensure a compliance with the necessary requisitions of Congress from the different state legislatures. Then all the several states being left to raise their own share of the revenue, and being the only proper judges of the mode most convenient to themselves, it is highly probable that this important branch of government would be carried on more generally to the satisfaction of each state; and would tend to promote a spirit of concord between all the parts of this great community. Because each being thus accommodated, and participating [in] the advantages of the union,—none subjected to any inconvenience thereby,—all would consequently concur in nourishing an affection for the government, which so cemented them. I believe, it is acknowledged that the establishment of excises has been one of the greatest grievances, under which the English nation has labored for almost a century and an half. Although this may seem an economical tax, as arising out of manufactures, from which the industrious may derive advantages; and whereof the wealthy by consuming the greatest share, will of course contribute the largest proportion of the tax: yet the nature of it being such, as requires severe laws for [422]its execution, it has justly become an object of general detestation. This has induced Judge Blackstone to declare that “the rigour and arbitrary proceedings of excise laws seem hardly compatible with the temper of a free nation.”2 While, therefore, you are freemen—while you are unused to feel any other power, but such as can be exercised within the bounds of moderation and decency, it, doubtless, behoves you to consider whether it is an eligible step to subject yourselves to a new species of authority, which may warrant the most flagrant violations of the sacred rights of habitation. If this branch of revenue takes place, all the consequent rigour of excise laws will necessarily be introduced in order to enforce a due collection. On any charges of offence in this instance you will see yourselves deprived of your boasted trial by jury. The much admired common law process will give way to some quick and summary mode, by which the unhappy defendant will find himself reduced, perhaps to ruin, in less time than a charge could be exhibited against him in the usual course. It has ever been held that standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to a free country; and no observation seems to contain more reason in it. Besides being useless, as having no object of employment, they are inconvenient and expensive. The soldiery, who are generally composed of the dregs of the people, when disbanded, or unfit for military service, being equally unfit for any other employment, become extremely burthensome. As they are a body of men exempt from the common occupations of social life, having an interest different from the rest of the community, they [are] wanton in the lap of ease and indolence, without feeling the duties, which arise from the political connection, though drawing their subsistence from the bosom of the state. The severity of discipline necessary to be observed reduces them to a degree of slavery; the unconditional submission to the commands of their superiors, to which they are bound, renders them the fit instruments of tyranny and oppression.—Hence they have in all ages afforded striking examples of contributing, more or less, to enslave mankind;—and whoever will take the trouble to examine, will find that by far the greater part of the different nations, who have fallen from the glorious state of liberty, owe their ruin to standing armies. It has been urged that they are necessary to provide against sudden attacks. Would not a well regulated militia, duly trained to discipline, afford ample security? Such, I conceive, to be the best, the surest means of protection, which a free people can have when not actually engaged in war. This kind of defence is attended with two advantages superior to any others; first, when it is necessary to embody an army, they at once form a band of soldiers, whose interests are uniformly the same [423]with those of the whole community, and in whose safety they see involved every thing that is dear to themselves: secondly, if one army is cut off, another may be immediately raised already trained for military service. By a policy, somewhat similar to this, the Roman empire rose to the highest pitch of grandeur and magnificence. The supreme court is another branch of federal authority, which wears the aspect of imperial jurisdiction, clad in dread array, and spreading its wide domain into all parts of the continent. This is to be co-extensive with the legislature, and, like that, is to swallow up all other courts of judicature.—For what is that judicial power which “shall extend to all cases in law and equity” in some having “original,” in all others “appellate jurisdiction,” but an establishment universal in its operation? And what is that “appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact,” but an establishment, which may in effect operate as original jurisdiction?—Or what is an appeal to enquire into facts after a solemn adjudication in any court below, but a trial de novo? And do not such trials clearly imply an incompetency in the inferior courts to exercise any kind of judicial authority with rectitude? Hence, will not this eventually annihilate their whole jurisdiction? Here is a system of jurisprudence to be erected, no less surprising than it is new and unusual. Here is an innovation, which bears no kind of analogy to any thing, that Englishmen, or Americans, the descendants of Englishmen, have ever yet experienced. Add to all, that this high prerogative court establishes no fundamental rule of proceeding, except that the trial by jury is allowed in some criminal cases. All other cases are left open—and subject “to such regulations as the Congress shall make.“—Under these circumstances I beseech you all, as citizens of Virginia, to consider seriously whether you will not endanger the solemn trial by jury, which you have long revered, as a sacred barrier against injustice—which has been established by your ancestors many centuries ago, and transmitted to you, as one of the greatest bulwarks of civil liberty—which you have to this day maintained inviolate:—I beseech you, I say, as members of this commonwealth, to consider whether you will not be in danger of losing this inestimable mode of trial in all those cases, wherein the constitution does not provide for its security. Nay, does not that very provision, which is made, by being confined to a few particular cases, almost imply a total exclusion of the rest? Let it, then, be a reflection deeply impressed on your minds—that if this noble privilege, which by long experience has been found the most exquisite method of determining controversies according to the scale of equal liberty, should once be taken away, it is unknown what new species of trial may be substituted in its room. Perhaps you may be surprised [424]with some strange piece of judicial polity,—some arbitrary method, perhaps confining all trials to the entire decision of the magistracy, and totally excluding the great body of the people from any share in the administration of public justice.

Letter,No,Edmund Randolph,James Madison,,,2/29/1788,"My dear friend The decision of Massts., had it been adverse to the constn, wd. have damned it here. But as it is, it fixes the event, if N. York, N. Hamp. and Maryland should follow the example. This must be understood with this restriction; that altho’ 9 states will force Va. by their assent to come in, there is reason to believe that no intelligence of that sort can reach us before our convention meets; as So. Carolina will sit on the 12th. of may only. I received a letter last night from Mr. P. H—y, mentioning his having resumed the practice of the law, and his determination to oppose the constn. even if only 1/2 a state should oppose.2 The baptist interest and the Counties on the So. Side of Jas. river from Isle of Wight, upwards, are highly incensed by H—y’s opinions, and public speeches, whensoever occasion has presented. As to the temper on the North side, I cannot clearly discern it. But upon a review made by Mr. Marshall of their comparative strength, he seems to think, that the question will be very nice. The election of Henrico commences on Monday. The persons proposed are Dr Foushee,3 Marshall and myself. Nothing but a small degree of favor, acquired by me, independently of the constitution, could send me; my politicks not being sufficiently strenuous against the constn. Marshall is in danger; [437]but F. is not popular enough on other scores to be elected, altho he is perfectly a Henryite. But to return to Massts—What a paltry snare?

The first is among the rocks on which the old confn. has split; the 2d. is aimed against the So.

I conceive is not true in supposing even at common law a trial of fact to be best on all occasions by a jury; and the 9th. can have been designed only to make out a number of amts. equal to the no. of states, who may give birth to the govt.

Newspaper,No,Republicus,,Kentucky Gazette,,3/1/1788,"——True liberty ——Always with right reason dwells Twinn’d, and from her hath no dividual being. Milton.1 There is but one source of political happiness, viz. liberty; our liberty is founded on our reason, which is the gift of heaven: this proves its excellence; but many sources of unhappiness, and slavery: every one of which, owes its existence to the abuse of some passion or appetite of mankind. Ambitious persons, already raised to a pitch of eminence, disgraceful to human nature; not contented with the vassalage of thousands, who have given themselves up to the vilest subjection, even to be bought or sold like asses or swine; too often, merely to gratify a wanton lust of domination, employ those very wretches, in the infernal business of subjecting others, before happy and free; this constitutes external slavery; of such an attempt we have had a recent trial; but there is another sort of slavery, which from the modesty of its appearance, and gentleness of its approaches, is not so alarming, and therefore the more dangerous; of which we ought continually to beware: viz. internal, that is, when a people already free, implicitly entrust, or permit, any set of men to form constitutions of government or enact laws for them; without inquiring, whether such constitutions, have for their basis, the true principles of liberty, and equal right. Of those principles I have, in a former paper,2 attempted a very succinct investigation: I shall in this, examine some parts of the federal constitution, (now held out to these states) according to those principles, and leave the public, impartially to judge for themselves. And here, I am happy in finding myself anticipated, and the work partly done to my hand, by the publication of a letter from a gentelman, whose official situation sets his sentiments in a very conspicuous point of view; and whose well known abilities and integrity, make every observation of his, merit the highest degree of attention;3 I shall therefore pass over those things which he has already done in so masterly a manner, and confine myself to a few points, which he has either slightly touched upon, or has been wholy silent.

Section I. “All legislative power herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the united states; which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives.[”] The absurdity of two houses of legislature, has formerly been touch’d upon on the supposition of their being both our representatives; but [447]that observation becomes here unnecessary: this appears without a mask: they (the senate) are not even the supposed representatives of any body; but distinguished from them, in as express terms as english words can do it; how then is this a Congress (that is a meet[i]ng) of the united States; when such meeting, does neither consist of the whole people of these states, nor wholly of the representatives of those people? but not to dispute about words let us consider the election, the proportional numbers, and the powers of this senatorial body. And first, they are to be chosen by the legislative bodies of the several states respictively: what numeral proportion these legislative bodies may bear to their constituents, or the people at large, is to me uncertain; but I will suppose it as one to two hundred; it is plain, that if they represent any body at all, it can be only those who have elected them, viz. one two-hundredth part of the people: bodies, having been chosen only for legislative purposes, and election, and legislation, being powers wholly different, and indeed too important to be both committed to the same set of men, at the same time; that choice can invest them with no right to delegate representatives for any body but themselves: but I confess this argument is superfluous, this constitution having in so many words, separated the very Idea or character of a senator, from that of a representative. Again, as to their numbers, there are to be two senators from each state; is not this visibly subversive of the great original right of equality? does it not tend to obliterate the very idea? To demonstrate this, requires only that we compare the representation of the states of Rhode-Island and Providence plantations, with that of Virginia; the former from their numbers, are intitled to have only one representative in Congress; the latter, on the same principle, and for the same reason, are to have ten[.] If Virginia, from her numbers, has a right to ten times the influence of Rhode Island, in the lower house of Congress, why not in the senate? I see no reasonable answer to this, but that the lower house consists of the representatives of the people, consequently are a regular, wel-proportioned body, the senate an unmeaning and arbitrary - - - of the different legislatures; and of consequence a body irregular, deformed, and disproportionate. But again, if we consider this power, it contains a very considerable and essential share of the elective, legislative, executive, & judiciary department, and in all these, they are independent of the people, nor in any instance responsible to them: from whence can their right to such power arise? It was never delegated to them from the people, who alone were justly possest of it; no exterior power had authority to confer it; it appears therefore a mere non-entity; or rather a complicated usurpation of power without right: and therefore to be [448]rejected: and yet, extraordinary as it may seem, this senatorial dignity, is to continue in the same hands six years, and even at the end of that term, they are again eligible, and so on a third, a fourth, a seventh time, to perpetuity. But I long to have them off my hands, as I would any other useless or dangerous commodity, and can only consider their institution, as a servile and ill-judg’d imitation of the house of lords in the British parliament, where (though there appears now and then a virtuous character) dissipation, venality, and corruption, are alternately, and incessantly brooding, growing, and triumphing; have often distracted the kingdom, and in some degree, inslaved the nation. I go now to Art. 2 Sec. I. which vest the supreme continental executive power in a president: in order to the choice of whom, the legislative body of each state, is empowered to point out to their constituents, some mode of choice, or (to save trouble) may choose themselves, a certain number of electors, who shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot, for two persons, one of whom, at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. Or in other words, they shall vote for two, one or both of whom they know nothing of. An extraordinary refinement this, on the plain simple business of election; and of which the grand convention have certainly the honour of being the first inventors; and that for an officer too, of so much importance as a president; invested with legislative and executive powers—who is to be commander in chief of the army, navy, militia, &c. grant reprieves and pardons, have a temporary negative on all bills and resolves, convene and adjourn both houses of congress, be supreme conservator of laws, commission all officers, make treaties, &c. &c. and who is to continue four years, and is only removable on conviction of treason or bribery and triable only by the senate, who are to be his own council whose interest in every instance runs paralel with his own: and who are neither the officers of the people nor accountable to them. Is it then become necessary, that a free people, should first resign their right of suffrage into other hands besides their own, and then, secondly, that those to whom they resign it should be compelled to choose men, whose persons, charracters manners or principles they know nothing of; and after all, (excepting some such change as is not likely to happen twice in the same century) to intrust Congress with the final desicion at last? Is it necessary, is it rational that the sacred rights of mankind should thus dwindle down to Electors of electors, and those again electors of other electors; this seems to be degrading them, even below the prophetical curse denounced by the good old patriarch, on the offspring of his degenerate son; [“]servant of servants” &c4 Art. 1. Sect. 4. “The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators, and representatives, shall be prescribed in each State, by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the place of chusing senators.[”] Whether this clause gives Congress a power to call the people of Georgia to chuse their representatives in the city of Boston, and on the twentieth of December, and so of every other State, I leave to be determined by better judges of language than myself: however, I believe I shall not be a miss in asserting, that it invests them with power to appoint the time of choosing senators, at the greatest possible distance from the usual, and perhaps constitutionally appointed time of meeting for the purpose of legislation: This latter in large States, or newly settled countries amounts to little less than a peremtory exclusion of all members of legislature, in exterior districts; who from their situation, are less liable to corruption: the former, if true, would put it into the power of a few, a very few! to appoint representatives for the whole continent: and both together, tend to perpetuate the authority, not only of the same men, but also of their heirs for ever. Again, I would ask (considering how prone mankind are to engross power, and then to abuse it) is it not probable, at least possible, that the president who is to be vested with all this demi-omnipotence, who is not chosen by the community, and who consequently, as to them, is irresponsible, and independent; that he, I say, by a few, artful and dependant emissaries in congress, may not only perpetuate his own personal administration, but also make it hereditary: that by the same means, he may render his suspensive power over the laws, as operative; and permanant, as that of G. the 3d over the acts of the British parliament: and under the modest title of president, may exercise the combined authority of legislation, and execution, in a latitude yet unthought of: or, that upon his being invested with those powers a second, or third time, he may acquire such enormous influence, as, added to his uncontroulable power over the army, navy, and militia; together with his private interest in the officers, of all these different departments, who are all to be appointed by himself; and so his creatures, in the true political sense of the word; and more especially when added to all this, he has the power of forming treaties, and alliances, and calling them to his assistance; that he may, I say, under all these advantages, and almost irresistable temptations, on some pretended pique, haughtily, and contemptuously, turn our poor lower house, (the only shadow of liberty we shall have left) out of doors, and give us law at the bayonets point: or may not the senate, who are nearly in the same situation, with respect to the people, from similar motives, [450]and by similar means, erect themselves easily into an oligarchy, towards which they have already attempted so large a stride; to one of which channels, or rather to a confluence of both, we seem to be fast gliding away; and the moment we arrive at it—farewell liberty. This leads me to Art. 1 Sect. 9. “The migration or importation of such persons, as any of the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808; (twenty years hence) but a tax, or duty may be imposed on such importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.[”] An excellent clause this, in an Algerine constitution; but not so well calculated (I hope) for the latitude of America. It is not to be disguised that by “such persons,” slaves are principally, if not wholly intended: and shall this be found among the principles of a free people, and making a radical part of the grand base, on which they would erect an edifice sacred to liberty. “Tell it not in Gath!”5 O that no envious surge might ever roll it to the eastern side of the atlantic! Unhappy africans! what have they done? Have they murdered our citizens or burnt our settlements? Have they butchered, scalped, and exhausted every device of torture, on our defenceless women, and innocent children; as the savage mescriants of our own country have done? No, no! Then, why deprive them of the greatest of all blessings, liberty, “without which,” says Dr. Price [“]man is a beast, and life a curse;6 while coward-like, we court, caress, and cringe to our murderers.[”] Ignorant, and comparatively innocent, till we taught them the diabolical arts of destruction, captivity, and death; and provided them with the infernal means of carrying them into practice; and all this to furnish ourselves with slaves, at the guilty expence oftimes, of the blood of, ten times the number of those thus enslaved, who lost their lives in the gallant, the virtuous defence of themselves, and families. Has this guilt ever been attoned? and do we boast of being advocates for liberty? shocking absurdity! More absurd still than a licence for such an execrable trade, should be radically woven into, and become an essential part of our national constitution a constitution, formed by a chosen assembly of our most eminent and respectable citizens; and where a personage presided, second to no individual of the human family. The boast of America.—The wonder of Europe.— O liberty! O virtue! O my country.7 Tell us, ye who can thus, coolly, reduce the impious principle of slavery, to a constitutional system: ye professed violators of liberties of mankind: where will ye stop? what security can you give, that, when there shall remain no more black people, ye will not enslave others, [451]white as yourselves? when Africa is exhausted, will ye spare America? and is not twenty years (taking into the accompt the slain with the more unhappy captives, victims to perpetueal slavery) sufficient to depopulate her inmost forests? Or is this only an ill boding prelude, sounded in the ears, and designedly introductory to the fate of these (yet unhappy) states, who gave you existence; and who even now, while you are thus ungratefully soaring toward the summit of Aristocracy, are honouring you with their confidence? I shudder at the catastrophe? awake my fellow citizens! and let this infamous clause, together with the principle which gave it birth, be not only expunged out of your constitution: but contemned, eradicated, torn from your heart forever. To conclude, I can think of but one source of right to government, or any branch of it; and that is the people. They, and only they, have a right to determine whether they will make laws, or execute them, or do both in a collective body, or by a delegated authority. Delegation is a positive actual investiture. Therefore if any people are subjected to an authority which they have not thus actually chosen; even though they may have tamely submitted to it, yet it is not their legitimate government: they are wholly passive, and as far as they are so, are in a state of slavery. Thank heaven we are not yet ar[r]ived at that state; and while we continue to have sense enough to discover and detect, and virtue enough to detest and oppose every attempt, either of force or fraud, either from without or within, to bring us into it, we never will. Let us therefore continue united in the cause of rational liberty. Let unity and liberty be our mark as well as our motto: for only such an union can secure our freedom; and division will inevitibly destroy it. Thus a mountain of sand may peace-meal be removed by the feeble hands of a child: but if consolidated into a rock, it mocks the united efforts of mankind, and can only fall in a general wreck of nature[.]"
Newspaper,No,A Federal Republican (VA),,Norfolk and Portsmouth Journal,,3/5/1788,"To the People of Virginia. Friends & Fellow Citizens, As the time fast approaches, when you are to make choice of persons to represent you in a Convention of this State, to be held in June next, for the purpose of considering the proposed plan of Federal Government, it becomes the duty as well as the right of every citizen, upon a subject so important, to offer his sentiments to the public; and I may add too, that it is peculiarly your interest at this momentous crisis, to give the most earnest attention to every thing which may tend in the remotest degree to give you information upon a subject of such vast magnitude. In order then, my fellow citizens, to form an idea of the nature of this business which so materially concerns the happiness of us all, it might not be improper to take a view of the powers granted to Congress by the articles of Confederation, as well as those proposed to be ceded to the Congress which will be appointed in case of the adoption of the new Constitution. By the articles of Confederation, the Congress of the United States was vested with powers for conducting the common concerns of the continent. They had the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war; of sending and receiving ambassadors; of entering into treaties and alliances, and of pointing out the respective quotas of men and money which each State should furnish. But it was expressly provided that the money to be supplied by each State should be raised by the authority and direction of the Legislature thereof: Thus reserving to the States the important privilege of levying taxes upon their citizens in such manner as might be most conformable to [458]their peculiar circumstances and form of government. With powers thus constituted, was Congress enabled to unite the general exertions of the continent in the cause of liberty, and to carry us triumphantly through a long and bloody war. It was not until some time after peace and a glorious independence had been established, that defects were discovered in that system of federal government which had procured to us those blessings. It was then perceived that the articles of Confederation were inadequate to the purposes of the union; and it was particularly suggested as necessary to vest in Congress the further power of exclusively regulating the commerce of the United States, as well to enable us, by a system more uniform, to counteract the policy of foreign nations, as for other important reasons. Upon this principle, a General Convention of the United States was proposed to be held, and Deputies were accordingly appointed by twelve of the States charged with power to revise, alter, and amend the articles of Confederation. When these Deputies met, instead of confining themselves to the powers with which they were entrusted, they pronounced all amendments to the articles of Confederation wholly impracticable, and with a spirit of amity and concession truly remarkable!2 proceeded to form a government entirely new, and totally different in its principles and organization. Instead of a Congress whose members could serve but three years out of six, and then to return to a level with their fellow citizens, and who were liable at all times, whenever the States might deem it necessary, to be recalled; Congress, by this new Constitution, will be composed of a body whose members during the time they are appointed to serve, can receive no check from their constituents. Instead of the powers formerly granted to Congress of ascertaining each State’s quota of men and money, to be raised by the Legislatures of the different States in such a mode as they might think proper, Congress, by this new government, will be invested with the formidable powers of raising armies, and levying money, totally independent of the different States. They will moreover, have the power of leading troops among you in order to suppress those struggles which may sometimes happen among a free people, and which tyranny will impiously brand with the name of sedition. On one day, the State Collector will call on you for your proportion of those taxes which have been laid on you by the General Assembly, where you are fully and adequately represented;—on the next will come the Continental Collector to demand from you those taxes which shall be levied by the Continental Congress, where the whole State of Virginia will be represented by only ten men! Thus shall we imprudently confer on so small a number the very important power of taking our money out of our pockets, [459]and of levying taxes without controul;—a right which the wisdom of our State Constitution will, in vain have confided to the most numerous branch of the Legislature. Should the Sheriff, or State Collector in any manner aggrieve you either in person or property, these sacred rights are amply secured by the most solemn compact: Beside, the arm of government is always at hand to shield you from his injustice and oppression. But if a Continental Collector, in the execution of his office, should invade your freedom (according to this new government, which has expressly declared itself paramount to all State laws and Constitutions) the State of which you are a citizen, will have no authority to afford you relief. A Continental Court may, indeed, be established in the State, and it may be urged that you will find a remedy here, but, my fellow citizens, let me ask, what protection this will afford you against the insults or rapacity of a Continental officer, when he will have it in his power to appeal to the seat of Congress perhaps at several hundred miles distance, and by this means oblige you to expend hundreds of pounds in obtaining redress for twenty shillings unjustly extorted? Thus will you be necessarily compelled either to make a bold effort to extricate yourselves from these grievous and oppressive extortions, or you will be fatigued by fruitless attempts into the quiet and peaceable surrender of those rights, for which, the blood of your fellow citizens has been shed in vain. But the latter will, no doubt, be the melancholy fate of a people once inspired with the love of liberty, as the power vested in Congress of sending troops for suppressing insurrections, will always enable them to stifle the first struggles of freedom."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,3/5/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) After the most deliberate reflections on this important matter, permit me, my dear countrymen, to declare to you in the most unfeigned [460]manner, that not perceiving any thing in the proposed plan of government, which seems calculated to ensure the happiness of America—I could not, as a fellow-citizen, resist the inclination to impart these sentiments to you. Unmoved by party—rage—unassailed by passion—uninfluenced by any other interest, but the genuine effusion of zeal for this, our common country, I confess to you in the language of sincerity and candor, that after the first reading of this new code, I could not behold it, but with an eye of disapprobation. Unwilling, however, to reject at first sight an object of such high moment, I resolved to distrust the propriety of a construction passed at so early a period.—This led me to peruse it with the utmost diligence I was capable of; and believe me, the foregoing observations have arisen from the fullest conviction, that the system involves in it the most dangerous principles; and—so far from exalting the standard of American liberty, I fear indeed that, should it be adopted, this glorious work, which already has cost the lives of many worthy patriots, will ere long be leveled with the dust. Let it not be conjectured from hence that any illiberal conceptions are formed by the writer hereof respecting the intentions of those gentlemen, who have offered this plan of federal government. He knows no circumstance inducing him to suppose they had any other object in view but the good of their country.—When we contemplate the great—the magnanimous HERO, who has conducted our armies through all the trying vicissitudes of danger and difficultly,—there is no man so disingenuous—there is no man so ungrateful, as to impute any transactions of his to sinister motives. Every true American is well assured that steadiness of virtue—that benignity of soul have the chief rule in all his actions.—Yet every American, and every other person, are satisfied also that there is no infallibility in human nature.—To be man is to be subject to error. The best, the greatest, the wisest are liable to commit mistakes.—Let it be remembered, then, that this code of government is solemnly proposed to every freeman in America. For what?—For the purpose of binding them without their approbation? No.—For an implicit acceptance? No.—For their adoption merely in compliment to the general convention? No.—What then?—Every man’s duty to his country points out to him the end of this proposition. Every man knows that it is for a free, a candid, an impartial discussion and determination thereon; whether they will approve and adopt it; or whether they will disapprove and reject it. Can any citizen, therefore, be so weak? can any be so timid? so pusillanimous, as to acknowledge that he has no right to exercise his own judgment with any regard to this matter? If there should be any haughty spirits among us, who think that this subject ought to be [461]handled by none but a few persons of eminent characters, let such recollect that the dignity, the importance of their country should inspire sentiments more exalted than the highest characters—sentiments, that should correspond with the worth of America, not with the consequence of any mere individuals. Will you, then, Virginians, arrogate too much by boldly asserting the privilege to judge for yourselves in what so nearly concerns the cause of liberty? No, no, my countrymen, you will not arrogate too much; you will not; I avow it by the souls of those brave patriots, who fought for the same cause in the late war. You will in this affair act as becomes you. The rank, you hold amongst the nations of the earth, requires this of you. And you will forfeit that rank: you will forfeit the character of freemen; and shew that you deserve to be enslaved, if you decline that privilege. The happiness of a multitude of people is certainly the highest advantage, which can be conferred on any society: and if you will contribute a full share of duty to effect this, so shall you obtain a due share of glory. No pomp of character, no sound of names, no distinction of birth—no preeminence of any kind, should dispose you to hoodwink your own understandings; and in that state suffer yourselves to be led at the will of any order of men whatsoever. The part you have acted heretofore,—the brave, the noble efforts, you have made, are proof enough of your fortitude, and totally exclude every idea of pusillanimity. Herein you have evinced the highest sense of public virtue; herein you have manifested to the whole world that the cause of liberty has hitherto had the prevailing influence over your hearts. And shall men possessed of these sentiments? shall those valiant defenders of their country, who have not feared to encounter toil and danger in a thousand shapes? who have not startled, even at the prospect of death itself? Shall you, O Virginians; shall you, I say, after exhibiting such bright examples of true patriotic heroism, suddenly become inconsistent with yourselves; and were2 to maintain a privilege so incontestibly your due?—No, my countrymen;—by no means can I conceive that the laudable vigor, which flamed so high in every breast, can have so far evaporated in the space of five years. I doubt not, but you will in this trying instance acquit yourselves in a manner worthy of your former conduct. It is not to be feared that you need the force of persuasion, to exercise a proper freedom of enquiry into the merits of this proposed plan of government: or that you will not pay a due attention to the welfare of that country, for which you have already so bravely exerted yourselves. Of this I am well assured; and do not wonder when imagination presents to my view the idea of a numerous and respectable body of men reasoning on the principles of this federal constitution. If herein [462]I conceive that you are alarmed at the exceedingly high and extensive authority, which it is intended to establish, I cannot but see the strongest reasons for such apprehensions. For a system, which is to supersede the present different governments of the states, by ordaining that “laws made in pursuance thereof shall be supreme, and shall bind the judges in every state, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,” must be alarming indeed! What cannot this omnipotence of power effect? How will your bill of rights avail you any thing? By this authority the Congress can make laws, which shall bind all, repugnant to your present constitution—repugnant to every article of your rights; for they are a part of your constitution,—they are the basis of it. So that if you pass this new constitution, you will have a naked plan of government unlimited in its jurisdiction, which not only expunges your bill of rights by rendering ineffectual, all the state governments; but is proposed without any kind of stipulation for any of those natural rights, the security whereof ought to be the end of all governments. Such a stipulation is so necessary, that it is an absurdity to suppose any civil liberty can exist without it. Because it cannot be alledged in any case whatsoever, that a breach has been committed—that a right has been violated; as there will be no standard to resort to—no criterion to ascertain the breach, or even to find whether there has been any violation at all. Hence it is evident that the most flagrant acts of oppression may be inflicted; yet, still there will be no apparent object injured: there will be no unconstitutional infringement. For instance, if Congress should pass a law that persons charged with capital crimes shall not have a right to demand the cause or nature of the accusation, shall not be confronted with the accusers or witnesses, or call for evidence in their own favor; and a question should arise respecting their authority therein,—can it be said that they have exceeded the limits of their jurisdiction, when that has no limits; when no provision has been made for such a right?—When no responsibility on the part of Congress has been required by the constitution? The same observation may be made on any arbitrary or capricious imprisonments contrary to the law of the land. The same may be made, if excessive bail should be required; if excessive fines should be imposed; if cruel and unusual punishments should be inflicted; if the liberty of the press should be restrained; in a word—if laws should be made totally derogatory to the whole catalogue of rights, which are now secure under your present form of government. You will, doubtless, consider whether the inconveniencies may not be very disagreeable, and perhaps injurious, to which this country may be subjected by excise laws,—by direct taxation of every kind,—by the [463]establishment of federal courts. You will advert to the dangerous and oppressive consequences, that may ensue from the introduction of standing armies in times of peace; those baneful engines of ambition, against which free nations have always guarded with the greatest degree of caution. You will determine likewise as to the propriety of being excluded from keeping ships of war without the consent of Congress. The situation of these states renders a naval force extremely desirable. Being bounded on one side by the sea, their coasts are accessible to every lawless adventurer: and without ships to guard them, they are subject to continual depredations. The expediency of this species of defence is manifest. The great advantages to be derived from it,—the strength,—the consequence, which it adds to a nation, are such, that every well-wisher to this country would rejoice to see as large a navy established, as the circumstances of the state can at any time admit of. This, therefore, seems to be a very improper restraint upon the states,—a restraint, which may perhaps eventually prove very injurious. Upon the whole, my fellow-citizens, if you judge this proposed constitution to be eligible or ineligible, you will accordingly instruct your delegates when they are about to meet in convention. The wisdom of the legislature has judged it advisable to fix the time for deciding on this momentous business at the distance of several months, that you may become thoroughly acquainted with a subject, which so nearly concerns your greatest interests. I know it is a favorite topic with the advocates for the new government—that it will advance the dignity of Congress; and that the energy, which is now wanting in the federal system, will be hereby rendered efficient. Nobody doubts, but the government of the union is susceptible of amendment. But can any one think that there is no medium between want of power, and the possession of it in an unlimited degree? Between the imbecility of mere recommendatory propositions, and the sweeping jurisdiction of exercising every branch of government over the United States to the greatest extent? Between the present feeble texture of the confederation, and the proposed nervous ligaments? Is it not possible to strengthen the hands of Congress so far as to enable them to comply with all the exigenc[i]es of the union—to regulate the great commercial concerns of the continent,—to superintend all affairs, which relate to the United States in their aggregate capacity, without devolving upon that body the supreme powers of government in all its branches? The original institution of Congressional business,—the nature, the end of that institution evince the practicability of such a reform; and shew that it is more honorable, more glorious—and will be more happy for each American state to retain [464]its independent sovereignty. For what can be more truly great in any country than a number of different states in the full enjoyment of liberty—exercising distinct powers of government; yet associated by one general head, and under the influence of a mild, just and well-organized confederation duly held in equilibrio;—whilst all derive those external advantages, which are the great purposes of the union? This separate independency existing in each—this harmony pervading the whole—this due degree of energy in the federal department, all together, will form a beautiful species of national grandeur. These will add lustre to every member, and spread a glory all around. These will command the admiration of mankind. These will exhibit a bright specimen of real dignity, far superior to that immense devolution of power, under which the sovereignty of each state shall shrink to nothing. It requires no great degree of knowledge in history to learn what dangerous consequences generally result from large and extensive powers. Every man has a natural propensity to power; and when one degree of it is obtained, that seldom fails to excite a thirst for more;—an higher point being gained, still the soul is impelled to a farther pursuit. Thus step by step, in regular progression, she proceeds onward; until the lust of domination becomes the ruling passion, and absorbs all other desires. When any man puts himself under the influence of such a passion, it is natural for him to seek after every opportunity, and to employ every means within reach, for obtaining his purpose. There is something so exceedingly bewitching in the possession of power that hardly a man can enjoy it, and not be affected after an unusual manner. The pomp of superiority carries with it charms, which operate strongly on the imagination. Nay, it is a melancholy reflection that too often the very disposition itself is transformed,—and for the gratification of ambitious views, the mild, the gentle, humane—the virtuous become cruel and violent, losing all sense of honor, probity, humanity and gratitude.—Hence, should it not be a maxim, never to be forgotten—that a free people ought to intrust no set of men with powers, that may be abused without controul, or afford opportunities to designing men to carry dangerous measures into execution, without being responsible for their conduct? And as no human foresight can penetrate so far into future events, as to guard always against the effects of vice,—as the securest governments are seldom secure enough;—is it not the greatest imprudence to adopt a system, which has an apparent tendency to furnish ambitious men with the means of exerting themselves—perhaps to the destruction of American liberty? It is next to impossible to enslave a people immediately after a firm struggle against oppression, while the sense of past injury is recent [465]and strong. But after some time this impression naturally wears off;—the ardent glow of freedom gradually evaporates;—the charms of popular equality, which arose from the republican plan, insensibly decline;—the pleasures, the advantages derived from the new kind of government grow stale through use. Such declension in all these vigorous springs of action necessarily produces a supineness. The altar of liberty is no longer watched with such attentive assiduity;—a new train of passions succeeds to the empire of the mind;—different objects of desire take place;—and, if the nation happens to enjoy a series of prosperity, voluptuousness, excessive fondness for riches, and luxury gain admission and establish themselves—these produce venality and corruption of every kind, which open a fatal avenue to bribery. Hence it follows, that in the midst of this general contageon a few men—or one—more powerful than all others, industriously endeavor to obtain all authority; and by means of great wealth—or embezzling the public money,—perhaps totally subvert the government, and erect a system of aristocratical or monarchic tyranny in its room. What ready means for this work of evil are numerous standing armies, and the disposition of the great revenue of the United States! Money can purchase soldiers;—soldiers can produce money; and both together can do any thing. It is this depravation of manners, this wicked propensity, my dear countrymen, against which you ought to provide with the utmost degree of prudence and circumspection. All nations pass this paroxism of vice at some period or other;—and if at that dangerous juncture your government is not secured upon a solid foundation, and well guarded against the machinations of evil men, the liberties of this country will be lost—perhaps forever! Let us establish a strong federal government, which shall render our Congress a great and eminent body, says one. By all means, replies another; and then they will command the attention of all Europe.—Why, pray, what will it avail you in the hour of distress—in the midst of calamity, though all Europe should pay attention to the Congress? What advantage will it be to the citizens of America, should they elevate Congress to the highest degree of grandeur;—should the sound of that grandeur be wafted across the Atlantic, and echoe through every town in Europe? What will the pomp—the splendor of that dignified body profit you, I say, if you place yourselves in a situation, which may terminate in wretchedness? Of what consequence will that state of congressional preeminence be to you, or to your posterity, if either the one, or the other should thereby be reduced to a mere herd of—? O great GOD, avert that dreadful catastrophe.—Let not the day be permitted to dawn, which shall discover to the world that America [466]remains no longer a free nation!—O let not this last sacred asylum of persecuted liberty cease to afford a resting place for that fair goddess!—Re-animate each spirit, that languishes in this glorious cause! Shine in upon us, and illumine all our counsels!—Suffer thy bright ministers of grace to come down and direct us;—and hovering for awhile on the wings of affection, breathe into our souls true sentiments of wisdom!—that in this awful, this important moment we may be conducted safely through the maze of error!—that a firm basis of national happiness may be established, and flourish in undiminished glory through all succeeding ages!

Newspaper,No,A Virginia Planter,,Virginia Gazette,,3/7/1788,"Messieurs BARTGIS and Co. The Freedom of the PRESS is the unalienable Right of a free Government particularly when matters of the greatest moment demand the serious attention, and free discussion of the citizens. [470] Your giving a place to the following lines in your entertaining paper, will oblige Your most obedient, humble servant, A VIRGINIA PLANTER. My dear Countrymen, I beg my intrusion upon your time and patience may be taken in good part, while you read a few sentiments, proceeding from the greatest anxiety of mind, respecting the Federal Constitution, which I have perused impartially, and from the examples of the introduction of the most arbitrary Forms of Government, we may venture to declare this plan to be replete with shackles for the free born sons of America.—Every intelligent person must know, that all the world is now groaning in a Hell of Slavery (America and Switzerland excepted) whereby it becomes absolutely necessary to consider the way and means by which they were brought into that infernal state. Can we produce an instance of one nation that ever recovered from a cursed state of vassalage, to the enjoyment of the just and indubitable rights of mankind? Are there none in trust that will postpone the adoption of this plan, while the people may reflect coolly upon a system of Government, lest they should subject themselves and millions yet unborn, to a state of political d——n? Are there none in power, with influence sufficient to prevent the direful catastrophe? or, are the frowns and vengeance of Heaven to be thus poured upon us? nay, we may rather conclude, that it is a tryal of our patriotism, and if we tamely submit to the yoke, we justly merit all the evil consequences resulting therefrom: but, if there are too few in the laudable opposition, What can Cato do Against a world, a base degenerate world, That courts the yoke, and bows the neck to Caesar. Addison,1 And did the Commonwealth of Rome ever recover their liberty from under the tyranny of Caesar and his successors? no, notwithstanding the virtuous struggles of Cato and a few, they are ever since, through a variety of changes, broiling in a Hell of Slavery, without the least glimpse or hope of deliverance from so d—ble a state. Similar to this will be the fate of America, if the Federal Constitution should be adopted and ratified in its present form. The powers granted to Congress are boundless in some instances of the utmost consequence to the people, particularly their interferance with the internal police of the States; their power of embarrassing the freedom of their own election; their taxing the people without immediate representation; [471]their power of raising an army for two years, which may be lengthened to any term for pretended reasons, which never failed to be done, as a principal step to tyranny; their power of legislation blended with that of the execution of their own laws, without controul. Many more may be mentioned of a fearful nature, but if the above were all, they are enough in the hands of men, to answer every purpose of making themselves absolute tyrants, and the people beasts of burden. The dangers from the above powers, are best known and verified, by attending to the introduction of slavery to all other nations. Pray give place one moment for a cool reflection, and consider, whether any man, or set of men, vested with unlimited power in any instance, who did not exercise it to the plague and torment of the people; to the destruction of every idea of common justice and humanity. What cannot Congress do with an army at their heels, the revenue in their pockets and with the full and absolute disposal of the militia? How do other nations fare in that predicament? History is replete with answers to the question, that they are groveling in the dark regions of slavery, and there they must remain until their own virtue work out their own deliverance, which is impossible, because, slaves and those who submit to slavery, and tyrants, have no idea of virtue, honor, or common justice. These are hard sayings; disagreeable to despots and their sycophants; but, not so painful to the community as the excruciating pains of a Hell of Slavery; they are stubborn truths that never bend without violence. How can we think of transmitting these fetters to posterity? What dishonour will it reflect upon us? Will they not curse the authors and abettors of their misery? Do we not stand indebted to transmit the same, and, if possible, more liberty to posterity, than our fathers handed down to us? Cannot Congress rank with the Princes of the earth, without stooping so low as to govern slaves? nay, they will exult in the government of freemen as the greatest honor under the Heavens. What can reflect greater infamy, than to rank with tyrants, those blood sucking cannibals, who prey insatiably and incessantly upon the vitals of their miserable, wretched, politically d—d subjects. The advanced age of the world has taught us, that the best of men are under the necessity of restraint, in every situation and circumstance respecting power. Power has altered the mildest and most affable characters, into the most abandoned cruelty and savage temper. History abounds with innumerable instances of those who, previous to their [472]being cursed with power, appeared as ornaments to human nature. Power is dangerous in the hands of men. Power alters all things, but God. The purpose of delegating power to men, is for the happiness and safety of the community, but with the want of proper limitations, it always proves to be a curse. I have often thought it a paradox in politics, how a few hundred of rulers can ruin the state of million[s] of subjects into a perfect Hell; the reason is, the few rulers are a junto, acting in close concert. Devil with Devil damn’d Firm concord holds.    Milton.2 While the people are like a rope of sand, vicious, ignorant and unconnected, lay themselves open to all the insults, injustice and barbarity, they please to inflict upon them. It is with the utmost concern I hear of the precipitancy and rashness of the populace in some of the United States, inadvertantly insisting for the speedy adoption of the Federal Constitution. Exactly similar to this was the mad frenzy of the populace of Rome, and many other nations, who inconsiderately cast themselves over the most dangerous precipice, into irretrievable ruin. Virginia has hitherto exhibited a good degree of moderation (some few instances excepted.) She has not yet pass’d the Rubicon, as some States have. As she is not the least in the grand Confederacy, may her wisdom, candor, and love of liberty, shine over the Union in the choice of a convention, whose virtue and abilities may be equal to so arduous an undertaking. Several personages in Congress will commend the freedom I take, to recapitulate the evils that may and will result from the present form of the Federal Constitution; to speak the truth, without just cause of offence, is the right of every free citizen. I am conscious of the approbation of every intelligent, honest man, and of the concurrence of every friend of America, to preserve that liberty inviolate, which we hold at the expence of so much blood and treasure."
Letter,Yes,Arthur Campbell,Francis Bailey,,,3/8/1788,"… The bearer Colo. Orth,2 will forward you a revised Copy of the Federal Constitution;—It is the work of a Society of Western Gentlemen,3 who took this method to investigate and understand the piece [473]& to some of them it has lately been hinted, that the most of the pieces wrote for and against the Constitution, were rather declamatory, and bewildered common readers in the perusal; but by our mode it may be shewn at one view, what is deamed right or what is wrong—In order to embrace so safe and direct a conveyance, too little time was afforded, to digest the amendments, and to make out a correct copy. May we request if of you, if you judge it worthy of a place in the Freemans Journal, first to give it a careful perusal, and have all inaccuracies removed. We would wish to see it in the first Page of your Paper, embellished with proper Capitals and a neat type. I suppose it will take part of two Weeks Papers, to compleat the insertion. we have thoughts of soliciting your patronage to have it inserted in the American Museum.4 We might venture to asure the Editor that it is nearer the sentiments of the great body of the Yeomanry of America, especially in the Southern States, than the original.—We have thought ourselves sufficiently disposed to “amity, concession and mutual deference”5 to be willing to surrender so much of our liberties to preserve the union, which is a great object with us: nor are we yet convinced, but that the States might be more safe, united, and prosperous, under something like what we now offer, than the other, which on a near view, seems to have too many of the features of despotism.—We for ourselves, for the sake of peace, and unity could submit for a course of years, by way of experiment say four, to absolute rule, provided we had security that a door would then be really open, whereby amendments might be offered. Should any of the friends to the original Plan offer sensible strictures on our amendments, we have so well considered the subject that we are not without arguments to support them.—By means of Capt. Robert Craig6 late of Lancaster County we expect in future to get the Freemans Journal, regularly. The inclosed copy of a letter will inform you of some late commotions in [the State of] Franklin, which you will please to insert.—I also send an extract of a letter received the other day from Kentuckey. I have a desire to attend the Synod next May,7 if I do, I will then be happy, in personally acknowleging how much I esteem and love a character impressed with a true stamp of freedom. P.S. I need not remind you, of the propriety of keeping my name secret in all communications sent you."
Letter,No,Arhur Campbell,Adam Orth,,,3/9/1788,"I came here on purpose to see you and converse on the subject of the proposed Federal Constitution, a matter that now so highly interests all America. I keep up an extensive correspondence in the Southern States and have a few intelligent friend[s] convenient to me; from all which information, we have ventured to forward to be printed a revised Copy of the Constitution, as nearer the sentiments of the People of America, than the original & yet energetic enough for all the purposes of good government. I have proposed to Mr. Bailey to print it in his News-Paper; but since on consideration I think it would be more extensively useful if first published in a Pamphlet, and speedily dispersed, especially in Pensylvania, N. York and Virginia.—Could not two or three of the Printers undertake to publish at their own risque I am sure several hundred copys would sell in Virginia, besides the clause in the Constitution in favour of the Press,9 may be of more value to them than ten thousand copys.—But should that mode of publication be found impracticable I would submit it to you, and the other worthy Patriots of the Minority, whether you had not risque the publication in a Pamphlet at your own expence taking care to sell them low and I am sure 500 Copies forwarded to a trusty correspondent in Petersburg Virginia would sell fast. And would it not be right to have it published in the German tongue also.—After you return to Pensylvania could you not, have a consultation with Messr. Findley Whitehill and Smilie,—or a Mr. M’Clean10 near Carlisle on the subject, and communicate your sentiments to Mr. Bailey who no doubt will act with secrecy, and propriety agreeable to your desire. I am not acquainted with Dr. Ewing11 but conclude it would be of great service, should he revise the Piece, and give his assistance. I dare say you are as fully as I am impressed with the importance of the subject; if the original piece has the seeds of despotism in it, we may be forging chains for our posterity; on the other hand the preservation of the union, ought to be a first object of all our cares: These two considerations combined produced the work now sent by you; which has a Declaration of Rights12 that I believe will please most, and has amendments to the original, that will make it a more mild & we hope a more just plan of government."
Letter,Yes,William Nelson Jr.,William Short,,,3/9/1788,"To a republican mind it indeed gives pleasure to see subjects resist the will of despots, or kings (for with me they are synonomous)—call him limited,—he still tramples on the rights of equality—It [476]is not merit on which the crown is confer’d—The monarch is not the choice of the people, from whom all power springs. No. he is the descendant of one, who may have been chosen, or has established himself by arms—The Government of Millions is to be entailed on a particular family—Be the heirs tyrannical, vicious, weak or all three combined—he is the anointed & all the people must bow—Such, my dear Short, is the humble situation to which in half a century America, I fear is doomed.—The theories of republicanism (at least according to my idea) are degraded as the phantasies of enthusiastick minds,—as metaphysical exercises for youthful genius; but too chimerical for practice.—My God! is it possible that thou hast given us the light of reason merely as an ornament, & not as a light wch. we are to follow in the pursuit of philosophical & political truth. Is sound argument at variance with fact? Is not what can be proved right agreeable to the course of things, or are we to prove that we ought to go to the right, & still to be drawn to the left by our own imperfections? Why, (may I ask?) are we permitted to prove a system right if, from our nature, we are disqualified from pursuing it?… … As to the diplomatick line, if the recommended constitution has not preserved the spirit of Republicanism, more permanent & higher salaries will probably be bestowed on publick offices.—"
Letter,Yes,William Nelson Jr.,William Short,,,3/13/1788,"Adams’s book in my opinion has already done considerable injury to America;2 for, tho’ there is not a new opinion in it, as it was written by an American, curiosity & the pleasure, perhaps arising partly from the vanity of reading an American production, have occasioned it to be generally read.3 He has laboured his point very much, as you know, &, not withstanding the confusion of his [argument] (method I will not call it), & style, he has so often repeated the same idea, & has made such a display of Authorities, as to make a heavy impression on many. I really think the book well calculated to prove his position,—that there shd. be more than one branch in the legislature; but when I see that under the title of a defence to the American constitutions, he has written an elaborate eulogium on the British Government & a defence of Monarchy (for he has actually proved that the American Governments are the best in the world, & immediately after that the British Government is still better), I confess, I wish that the book had never been written or, at least, think there is a great impropriety in the American Ambassador at the court of G. B. being the author of it.4… With Respect to the recommended Governmt, you must have discovered, from many hints in this letter, that I do not like the principles of it.—The president is to be elected every four years; but he may be [477]elected as long as he lives. This, I think, not consistent with the spirit of Republicanism—After having served four years, he shd. return to the body of the people, & be incapable of serving for a certain term at least; for the same man will generally be continued as long as he lives, unless he shd. perpetrate some thing very flagitious—his son will be elected partly for his merit; but much also because his father was in the office before him,—& his grandson entirely because his father & grandfather were there before him. Thus it is, that hereditary governments have been established in all countries—The Emperor of Germany is said to be elective; but the Roman eagle, I fancy will never take flight from the Austrian family—The Doge of Venice was originally for life, he is now hereditary—The senate in the new government are legislative, executive, & judiciary. They are to advise the president, & then to try him—If he follows their advance they will be partial in his favor,—if he does not, they will be prejudiced agt. him. There are other objections of less importance, tho’ very weighty, but if they wd. declare the president ineligible after having served a certain term, I think the necessity of an union wd. induce me to assent to it without hesitation—At present, I think the adoption of it in this country probable—Six states have taken it, & amongst them Massachusetts. This will have great weight in this State, tho’ the people on the South-side of James River, from Prince George upwards are extremely averse to it.…"
Newspaper,No,Senex,,Independent Chronicle (VA),"Valerius,State Soldier",3/19/1788,"Mr. DAVIS, You will oblige several of your Subscribers, by publishing the following short Essay in Wednesday’s Chronicle—Postponing it longer would defeat the writer’s intention.2 Several essays lately published, require a filtering process; teeming with personalities. The great questions that originate from the new constitution meet only a secondary consideration, and though armies of words have been paraded, nothing more has been done, than proving the President and Senate do not possess two-thirds of legislative power: surely some regiments might have been directed to shew the probability of a paralytic stroke, rendering inactive those powers, America is modestly requested to convey to a few of her sons. Unfortunately the combined forces of argument are otherwise applied; and we find the constitution obliged by Valerius to depart from [506]its letter, and announce what the wisdom of the convention never designed, viz. “is not the senate amenable to the different state legislatures by whose breath they exist, and can in a moment be annihilated.” Ruminate, Valerius, on the above assertion, and the invective against Mr. Lee of flagrant violation of truth, when your next period admits, each state has only a vote in electing a Senator, on a particular occasion, which you suppose will seldom if ever occur. Every man certainly ought to determine agreeable to the assent of his understanding; but no intuitive perception of right or wrong, can justify an erroneous statement of fact—you must therefore, Valerius, excuse being called on to acknowledge you misconceived the constitution, in assuming the votes for President were to be taken by states, only, when two or more candidates had equal voices, as art. 2d, sect. 1, enacts that mode for every case, except when one candidate has a majority of electors. I must now give the State Soldier that applause he merits, and candidly admit his arguments about the liberty of the press,3 cannot be suspected of—one—Plagiarism, for no antient or modern sage ever before attempted to prove the press cannot flourish in a free country, and that the soil of despotism affords it more nourishment, than pure earth cultivated in a popular style—Though fond of experimental philosophy, I humbly conceive France must be admitted an exception to the above ingenious theory, for in that kingdom Lettres de Cachet, generally correct vulgar antiquated notions of government, and French genius, awed by the majesty of a bastille, or the impending axe, flies to neighboring nations for protection; and the policy of despotism will suffer no book or even news-paper to be printed without a licence obtained from inspectors, who invariably refuse one, to every writer who presumes to animate mankind to the recollection of natural rights. A free press is their faithful guardian, by bringing to light the silent advances of ambition—by informing the community at large of the good or evil that may flow from any proposition. The present crisis confirms it beyond the reach of scepticism, and had printers betrayed the public, by refusing to insert those strictures patriotism, vanity, or selfishness have brought forth, the new constitution would have been eagerly adopted, without reflecting on those vices and virtues that seem to contend in the womb, and alternately create admiration and indignation in the contemplating mind of every citizen. What man now views the subject, as when first presented?—What infinite wisdom, inspired foresight, &c. echoed from every corner?—How different the scene in 1788—Intemperate adulation, and the lethargy, [507]reverence to great names gave birth to, gradually declining. Reason reassumes her scales, proclaiming with awful energy from north to south, that the rights retained by the people do not counter-balance the powers conveyed away,—that the evils of a relaxed government have been great, but contrary extremes may be greater. Such are the consequences of free discussion,—may its source, the liberty of the press, remain a perpetual blessing to America, and her sons who fought and bled like the Old Soldier, for free constitutions, perfect the great work, not adopt a creed recently exec[r]ated, become cynically sullen, or stigmatize old friends for retaining republican sentiments. The passions, the animosity of partisans, are foreign to patriotism,—they vainly exhaust metaphor, in abusing him who cannot be forgot without ingratitude—While the resentment of individuals vanishes with themselves, and millions descend to parent earth, unnoticed, unknown, remote generations must venerate that man, who, on the fourth day of July, 1776, moved Congress to declare America independent,4 “Spoke an Empire into birth.” Remember him, freeholders of Westmoreland!5—suffer no party work to delude you, by relinquishing the honor of such a representative at the next convention! Manchester, March 14, 1788"
Newspaper,No,A Ploughman,,Virginia Gazette,,3/19/1788,"Messieurs BARTGIS & Co. Your giving a place to the following, in your impartial Gazette will oblige A CUSTOMER. Dear Countrymen, When we address the People at large, we approach the source of majesty, power and dominion, for all authority and constitutional right of government originates with, and proceeds from, the People; but, when the People become so degenerated as to have no jealousy for their dignity, rights and privileges, they never fail to find usurpers in power and dominion; and various have been the [508]schemes for that purpose, sometimes by artful insinuations, sometimes by sheer deception, and often by open violence. Not long since, the ambitious sons of Britain made wide stretches in their encroachments upon our liberties, but by our virtue and bravery, we shook off the insupportable yoke, and thereby became the most free, happy and renowned people in the universe. But, Liberty! That Heaven-born darling of every virtuous soul, must undergo her long-accustomed treatment. When banished from Asia, Africa and Europe, she appeared in all her beauty and excellence, in the dreary regions of America; you see how ambition and avarice beset her, with all their sordid concomitants, and are indefatigably exerting every nerve to force her flight from our world, to those blissful regions from whence she descended. The happy state of America, in the enjoyment of liberty, roused up the envy of the sons of pride, who never could bear with the happiness of the people in any part of this world, have formed a plan of government, incompatible with, and subversive of, those virtuous plans established by our brave and worthy patriots of the late revolution. And in order to rivet the chains of perpetual slavery upon us, they have made a standing army an essential of the Federal Constitution, which the world cannot produce an instance of a more permanent foundation to erect the fabrick of tyranny upon; here we are to support and pay our own tormentors, with a bayonet at our breast; to be domineered over by the instruments of tyranny and oppression, and to keep a standing army, gives cause to suspect that the rulers are afraid of the people, or that they have a design upon them. If their designs are oppressive, the army is necessary to compleat the tyranny; if the army is the strongest force in a State, it must be a military government, and it is eternally true, that a free government and a standing army are absolutely incompatible. An army is so forcible, and at the same time so terrible an instrument, that any hand that wields it may, without much dexterity, perform any operation, and gain any ascendency in human society, and is a mortal distemper in a free government, of which it must inevitably perish. It was a custom with Lord Walpole when he was minister of state in England, that if any borough did not elect whom he directed, he would send a messenger of satan to buffet them, viz a company of soldiers to live upon them. I wish the majesty of the people, together with Congress, would consider, that notwithstanding the throne of tyranny is upheld by an army, it is in continual danger of being overthrown by the same army. Armies have dethroned many a tyrant of their own setting up, and are [509]sure to set up another tyrant in his place. Witness many of the Roman Emperors (of scarlet memory); the Turkish Emperors with their bloody bashaws. Witness the tyrant Charles the first of England; the same army set up the tyrant Cromwell, whom they would murder, had he not concealed himself; but the same army hanged him at Tyburn after he was dead, and that same army set up the tyrant Charles the second; so that an army, with all its inherent malignancy, force and terror, is not to be depended upon; if they do not butcher the people, they will sacrifice their masters; the nature and disposition of an army will not admit of their being inoffensive. Permit me, my dear fellow citizens, to add one truth more as true as the gospel; that by the Federal Constitution, every soul in America will be an absolute slave; the common people, who are the best and greatest supporters of government will be slaves to a numberless herd of creeping sycophants; those will be slaves to their employers; their employers will be slaves to Congress, and Congress will be slaves to the army, and the army will be slaves to the &c. &c. &c. These sentiments are stubborn truths which none upon earth but an American dare hold up to the publick; but if the Federal Constitution be ratified, the Liberty of the PRESS, that palladium of Freedom, will be lost also. Finally, my fellow citizens, you ought to consider this period to be the most interesting you ever saw, or ever will see; now is the time to secure, or to bid an eternal farewell to liberty. Your interest is inseperably connected with that of Your humble servant, A PLOUGHMAN. Cherry-lane, March 3, 1788."
Letter,Yes,Caleb Wallace,William Fleming,,,3/22/1788,"… At present I will not venture my opinion concerning the Form of Government proposed for the Federal Union on which you wrote to me last fall, and which has greatly excited the attention of almost every body in this Quarter but myself. At first my Sentiments were suspended on the magnitude and intricasy of the Subject, and latterly though I wish to study it, I find the Subject to be ungrateful to a mind too much born down with a domestic affliction.2 However when I write again I purpose to be more particular than time will permit at present. I shall only add that I expect our Representatives from this District w[ill] [unanim]ously vote against the adoption of this Cons[titution] [unless it] is materially amended."
Newspaper,No,Mentor,,Virginia Gazette (Petersburg),,4/3/1788,"Messrs. Hunter and Prentis, When we consider the peculiar advantages arising from a free, expeditious, and general communication of sentiments upon all subjects which concern the public weal, through the channel of newspapers—a channel through which the precious stream of political instruction is diffused, in governments like ours, more extensively than by any other method the wisdom and ingenuity of man hath as yet suggested; have we not reason to be grateful to the God of humanity and liberty, who hath placed us, after a long and painful struggle, in so eligible a situation, as to enable us to receive instruction from the ingenious and benevolent disquisitions of many of our fellow-citizens; which through the channel of a newspaper, and under the auspices of a free press, have gone forth as political missionaries, to inform the minds and enlarge the understandings of the bulk of the people, as to those leading and essential points which contain every thing dear to them as men and members of society? If these advantages are to be derived from a free circulation of knowledge [700]among that class of men who most require it, what evil consequences may we not apprehend from a contrary conduct being persued? What have we not a right to expect will be the fate of our natural rights—and what new species of tyranny may we not experience, when any one individual, by virtue of, and under the authority of office, shall dare, under the eye too of our rulers, to check or suppress an institution so highly necessary and beneficial as that established even in the bondage of monarchy, for the conveyance of letters, newspapers, &c.? What must be our opinion of the merits of that system (if it be done to promote any particular one) which should require the adoption and exertion of such unwarrantable and injurious powers to support and establish it? What must we think of the regard of those in authority, who either encourage this unfriendly measure, or connive at its continuance, by not suppressing it? In short, are we not to think that our rights and liberties, our instruction and welfare, are no longer leading objects in the eyes of those we have set over us; and that they are sighing after the loaves and fishes of monarchy, when they shall permit any measure to be adopted and continued, which shall be pregnant with mischief to their constituents; or when they shall be so unmindful of their trust, as to suffer any man to exercise the powers of office, who shall have shewn himself the pliant agent for the basest of purposes? I am led into this train of thought, Gentlemen, by having noticed for some time past, and in this most important of all periods to the citizens of America, the great difficulty of procuring intelligence from the northern and eastern states, respecting their debates and proceedings on that grand question which hath now become the object of anxious attention to every well-wisher of his country; and was not able to account for so unfortunate a circumstance as I then conceived it, until I observed the iniquitous mystery, in some degree, developed by a writer in a late Baltimore paper.(a) In order that the suggestions of that writer may be corroborated or confuted by concurrent testimony, and as the present is a period too big with important consequences, to prevent any man from making every inquiry necessary to his welfare and happiness, I must request you to inform the public, through your very useful paper, in what manner the newspapers have been transmitted to you from that quarter of the United States—whether you have received them as regularly as the late rigorous season would permit? If not, at what period did the regular conveyance of them cease? Happy shall I be to find that my apprehensions have been without foundation—but should they appear to be supported by melancholy fact, I shall lament the early departure [701]of that noble, disinterested, independent spirit of republican virtue, which was once so dear to, and idolized by, the patriotic sons of Columbia!"
Letter,No,George Lee Turberville,James Madison,,,4/16/1788,"Yr. favor of ye. 1st. Ulto.2 reached me on the 7th. instant. The satisfactory information it contain’d deserves and receives my most Cordial & gratefull acknowledgements—altho I had satisfied myself in many respects touching ye arguments of the opponents to the new Constitution—yet I never before was so well acquainted with those powerfull reasons that may be urged agt. the adoption of a Bill of Rights—the favorite Topic of the ablest Antifœderal declamers—at the [739]time I had ye honor of writing to you3—I had some expectation of being elected to the convention but it has pleased my County men to make choice of other Gentlemen, therefore my attention to this Subject for six months will be no other wise advantageous to me than that it has enabled me to form a judgement upon it from mature consideration for myself—Whereas had I not expected to have Voted upon it—I might have contented myself with the first opinion that reached me—What has not been done by ignorance—cunning—Interest—and Address to blast and blacken this Production? Misrepresentation—False reasoning—& wilful perversion have been made use of agt. ye. peice itself—Calumny and Falshood have Stamp’d ye objects of those who framed it with the most infamous colours—The design of Its artfull enemies whose interests are opposite to the operation of an efficient Government—have resorted to arts like those above enumerated—hoping to effectuate by the operation of Clamour upon ye. passions—(what Reason applied to ye senses wou’d for ever reprobate and condemn)—“The rejection of the New Constitution” The result of a very cool enquiry into the probable effects of the new Constitution in my mind—in a few Words, is that it is adequate to every beneficial consequence for which Governments are or ought to be instituted—whilst at the same time the Checks are so ingeniously interposed between ye Rulers and ye Citizens as to leave all power—in the hands of the people—and therefore it is impossible that it shou’d ever continue perverted to bad purposes untill it is dangerous—unless the great mass of the people shou’d become Corrupt! ignorant of their Birthright—and regardless of their posterity—shou’d such at any period be the unhappy Characteristick of My fellow Citizens—they will then deserve—& must inevitably wear the Yoke of slavery—it will not be in the power of Folios of Bills of rights to maintain their Liberties—The rights of Freemen are only to be maintain’d by Freemen—and when the Spirit of Freedom—(that has ever elevated those who felt its influence amongst Mankind—) becomes extinct in the bosoms of men—Liberty itself will be a curse to them— Experience the parent of Wisdom has already taught us that unanimity amongst us can be successfull—& That an attempt to Tyrannize hath already given unanimity to America—Each state will still have a Legislature possessing its confidence as effectually as the old Assemblies did—as adequate to the purposes of calling forth the forces and resources of the States, and as free to commune with the assemblies of the sister states—have we any reason then to suppose that an Act of Oppression wou’d pass unnoticed when issued by the New Congress? that the states wou’d not be unanimous in their opposition? or [740]that the general government which depends for support upon the individual states wou’d be enabled to triumph over the Liberties of America—when the Fleets and Armies of the British King supported by the Wealth of Britain were inadequate? The sense of this State is it is to [be] feared but too much divided upon this weighty subject—indeed those who pretend to be acquainted with the opinions of the members elected do not hesitate to declare that the Members from Kentuckey will determine the question—and they admit that a Majority of 12 or 14 members are in favor of the adoption of the Gover[n]ment—from this Side of ye Cumberland Mountain— I cou’d wish just for private gratification to be satisfied upon the subject of the Congress having the power to regulate the Time manner and place of holding Elections—the Clause is Ambiguous & Contradictory—First the States are to regulate—& then Congress are to alter—if they had declared that Congress might direct—in case of Neglect or refusal in the state—it wou’d have been clear—it is now as I have before said Ambiguous—and to Jealous minds it becomes an insurmountable objection—at the same time I am not apprehensive of Evil from that quarter, for was the Congress to attempt [the] Exercise of this power for party purposes—the intention wou’d be too apparent to pass by unnoticed—it wou’d create commotions that might prove fatal to the Congress itself—and therefore it is nugatory; for at the time when they may Venture upon the partial exercise of this power for party purposes—they may hold every constitutional check as dead letters—Suppose also that 2, 3 or 4 States shou’d reject the constitution—are they to form a separate confederation?—or are the nine to exercise coercion to bring them in?—or are they to be declared out of the Confederation?—This is by far the most exceptionable part of the Whole peice— Pardon this long Letter replete with nothing that can be new or agreeable to you—remember when you are reading it that it is ye. want of matter not of inclination in ye writer to amuse you—Let me hope that as you may find yourself at Leizure you will be good enough to favor me with a line—remembring that in this retirement—a knowledge of what is passing in the world is doubly grateful—because it is so seldom that we ever become acquainted with it—"
Letter,No,Edmund Randolph,James Madison,,,4/16/1788,"My dear friend I thank you for your favor of the 10th. inst. from Orange. Colo. Nicholas in a late letter to me seems to think, that the majority is decidedly for the constitution.2 Accuracy cannot be expected; but a comparison of the intelligence, which centers here from the various parts of Va., persuades me, that he at least mistakes the degree of the majority, and leads me to believe suspect, that it lies adverse to the constn. so far as previous amendments go. Two objections have always struck me, as deserving consideration on the subject of previous amendments; one, that under their cover, a higher game might be played, the other, that the hope of obtaining them might be frustrated by the assent of too many states. The former I fear more and more, daily; not knowing how far the schemes of those who externally patronize them, may internally extend, believing that personal irritation has roused some to enlarge their original views of opposition, and having myself no disposition to enjoy the credit of establishing my own opinion at the expence of public safety. I mention these things in confidence; especially as my final determination will not be taken, until I hear something from Maryland at least. The accts. brought hither yesterday by Mr. Jones,3 who had them from Colo. Hooe of Alexa.4 are, that Chase, Paca, Mercer and L: Martin are elected in Annapolis, to the exclusion of all the Carrols5 and that Chase had caused a clerk of his to be elected in a county, which he could not represent.6 Upon the subject of religion, I have no difficulty. The Indiana claim seriously affects me. My idea of its revival depends not upon any words in the constn. expressly giving it new birth, but from the jurisdiction which the fœderal ct. will enjoy. The question with them will be, is the right of the company an existing right. The merits cannot be suppressed, but by making the decision of the assembly conclusive. This I think is very difficult. But I never can agree to found any conduct of mine upon injustice. I therefore fear the claim, only because it may create a ferment with the settlers on Indiana, or among the citizens, who may eventually make them retribution Mr. Buford being in a hurry I cannot add as much as I wish. I shall go to visit the post at the Point of Fork, on monday & thence to Albemarle, where I should be happy to see you. I have sent to Mrs. Carr to inform her, that I had thirty pounds [742]from you for her but I have had no application for it, nor a safe oppy of sending it— Mr. B. carries a letter from Colo. Hamilton to you.7"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Samuel Adams,,,4/28/1788,"Your favour of December 3d, in the last year,2 reached me the last of January following, and it should have been answered with my thanks long since, if the uncommon badness of the winter, stopping all communication, had not prevented. Your sentiments on the new political structure, are, in my mind, strong and just. Both reason and experience prove, that so extensive a territory as that of the United States, including such a variety of climates, productions, interests; and so great difference of manners, habits, and customs; cannot be governed in freedom—until formed into states, sovereign, sub modo, and confederated for the common good. In the latter case, opinion founded on the knowledge of those who govern, procures obedience without force. But remove the opinion, which must fall with a knowledge of characters in so widely extended a country, and force then becomes necessary to secure the purposes of civil government; hence the military array at Kamtschatka, at Petersburg, and through every part of the widely extended Russian empire.3 Thus force, the parent and the support of tyranny, is demanded for good purposes, although for ever abused to bad ones—that a consolidated, and not a federal government, was the design of some, who formed this new project, I have no doubt about. The dazzling ideas of glory, wealth, and power uncontrolled, unfettered by popular opinions, are powerful to captivate the ambitious and the avaricious. With such people, obedience resulting from fear, the offspring of force, is preferable to obedience flowing from esteem and confidence, the legitimate offspring of the knowledge that men have of wisdom and virtue in their governors; and, above all, from the conviction that abuses may be rectified by the substantial checks that political freedom furnish. Massachusetts, I see, has adopted the plan; but proposes to insist perseveringly on amendments.4 If it were permitted an individual to question so enlightened an assembly, I would ask, why submit to a system requiring such amendments, and trust to creatures of our own creation, for the correcting of evils in it that threaten the destruction of those ends for which the system was formed? The fear of greater evils has been stated: but I cannot help considering such fears as being generated by design upon weakness. [766]The objections to the present system, if accurately considered, will, I believe, be found to grow out of those temporary pressures, created by a long and expensive war, which time and prudence may remove. But, though it were admitted that some amendments to the present confederation would better promote the ends designed by it, why, for that reason, exterminate the present plan, and establish on its ruins another, so replete with power, danger, and hydra-headed mischief? The Massachusetts amendments are good, so far as they go. The first, third, and fourth amendments are well contrived to keep in existence the state sovereignties; and the first particularly proper for securing liberty from the abuse of construction, which the new plan most amply admits of. But why, my dear friend, was the provision in your seventh proposition of amendment, confined to causes between citizens of different states, since the reason applies to suitors of every country, and foreigners will be more apt than our own citizens to abuse, in the way, which, that part of the proffered plan permits, and which this amendment of Massachusetts is designed to prevent? England and Scotland are united for every good purpose of defence and offence, yet a foreigner cannot sue a resident Scotsman in England for debt contracted in Scotland: nor will any foreign nation upon earth grant a similar privilege to our citizens over theirs, of calling their people from their own countries to answer demands against them—the fixt idea of all the European nations being, that strangers are not to have privileges in their own country superior to what their own subjects enjoy."

Letter,Yes,George Mason,John Francis Mercer,,,5/1/1788,"… From the returns I have seen of the elections here, I think the Convention of Virginia will be so equally divided, that no man can at present form a judgment of what may be the determination. The Federalists, as they improperly style themselves, talk of a considerable majority; but it is notorious that many of them [– – –] honor of their cause be it spoken, stick at no falsehood or [– – –] to accomplish their [780]purpose. As soon as any tolerably [– – –] judgment can be formed of the politics of our Convention I will not fail to communicate them to you.…"
Letter,Yes,Caleb Wallace,William Fleming,,,5/3/1788,"We have received your sympathetic letter of March the 8th. by Miss M’Bride and one from Mrs. Fleming of the 6th. of April which gave us much consolation, especially as they came from friends whom we are persuaded do realy bear a part of our Affliction.2 This bereavement and the ill state of health I have been in for some months past have greatly indisposed my mind to political investigations; for which reasons I omitted returning you my sentiments on the proposed form of Continental Government to which you called my attention last fall. But hearing that you have accepted an appointment to our State Convention3 I shall now attempt a few observations on the interesting subject As by a Federal Union the independence of the American States was obtained, I have always considered the continuing and perfecting that Confederation equally essential to its permanency and rising glory; therefore the calling a continental Convention was my anxious desire, [782]and I confess on the first perusal the government they have devised seemed in the main to answer my expectations. Wishing Congress to be invested with ample powers to accomplish all federal purposes, the new System pleased me in this which I thought the most important article; in some other instances my feelings were hurt and my fears alarmed, but being much distressed for our National Faith and security I did not then so fully realize, as I have since done, the danger of introducing greater evils than those from which we had been delivered at the expence of much blood and treasure. How common, how natural is it for narrow minded man by avoiding Scylla to fall into Charybdis! To say no more in this way our American sages have erred. The complication of powers and prerogatives they have heaped on their Senate President and Vice President are intolerable. Their Judicial Courts in various respects are equally so. Their omitting a Declaration of Rights almost induces me to suspect the virtue of their intentions. And their want of precision in defining the limits of the several departments of their intended Government gives suspicion an ascendency I wish my charity to possess. I have lately perused Masons Randolph’s and Gerry’s reasons for dissent4 with some other writings on the same side of the question, and find myself constrained to embrace their sentiments; only I cannot join in opinion with some of them that by the constitution of gover[n]ment a man should be excluded from office as soon as by experience he is qualified to fill it. But as a repetition of the remarks that have been made by others cannot be entertaining I shall principally attend to two or three objections that I think deserve consideration and that have not been taken notice of in any of the publications I have seen. (1) Congress are to exercise exclusive legislation over ten miles square; that is to say, they are to exercise absolute dominion over the inhabitants, as by the System this district cannot have the shadow of representation in the government to which they are to be subjected. This from a combination of circumstances will be the most successful nursery of slaves that ever was devised by man: the money, the amusements, and the elegance if not splendor that will centre here must make it very populous. It will be a market where liberty may be sold for a valuable consideration: if these advantages will not be thought an equivolent by some, the honours and emoluments that may be solicited and obtained from government, will, in addition, come up to the price of the bulk of mankind. The sum of the whole is, that these numerous and wealthy slaves will infallibly be devoted to the views of their masters; and having surrendered their own, will always be ready to trample on the rights of free men. This suggests another objection. (2) Numerous [783]offices of profit and honour will be in the gift of the continental Executive; And on whom will these be generally conferred? No doubt on courtiers. By these officers, or rather creatures of state, the supreme government will be administered and Congressional purposes accomplished without regard to the State governments or feeling for individuals. With the assistance of these two powerful Armies what may not be effected by Congress even though they had not the continental sword and purse at their command. As to the ten Miles square the idea should be execrated as it is dictated by vanity and not by necessity; and the Officers should be recommended by and be actual inhabitants of the respective States in which they are severally to officiate; at least they should be elected by the representatives of the people assembled in Congress; which would in a great measure guard against the evils I have stated, and give the meritorious in the most distant parts of the union some chance for preferment. (3) The third objection more immediately relates to this and the other western parts of the Union. Under this New Government Imports and Exports cannot be taxed nor prohibited without the consent of Congress. This is a restriction that the general good does not absolutely require, but must be ruinous to those whose local situation makes it necessary to discourage foreign superfluities and to encourage home Manufactures. To say that Congress will give every reasonable indulgence; and that individuals will not be restrained from industry nor compelled to purchase gewgaws is little to the purpose, as it is evidently unsafe to depend on one or the other in this Case. If the State Governments are to have an existence, their end must be to guard their communities from evils that may not effect the union in general; and if in any instance these communities are deprived of the power to restrain individuals from doing that which will be injurious to their common interest, so far their Gover[n]ments will be a burthen without an advantage; or I might rather say, they will evidently and materially fall short of their end. I also wish to say something on the danger of giving Congress an unlimited power of internal taxation. The more I consider it the more I am alarmed. If the circumstances of the union requires the measure I am willing to submit to it as a necessary evil; but if it can in any way be restrained or guarded from abuse, nothing can be more advisable. You will gather from what I have written that I think the calling another continental Convention should not be delayed, to which I can foresee no impediment but obstinacy. Indeed I am decided in my opinion that the proposed plan of Government should be subjected to a reconsideration for ye. single reason, if no other, that it was done by men who exceeded their Commission, and whatever may be pleaded [784]in excuse from the necessity of the case, something should certainly be done to disclaim the dangerous president [i.e., precedent] which will otherwise be established. I still hope that an attachment to the independence of America and that love of equal liberty which first gave it existence will silence party heats and cabals and lead to a system that will promise lasting internal security and tranquility to all the members of the union, which ought to be the first object; as external respectability will be an inseperable concomitant. If the event should be otherwise, it will be obvious that the late struggle with Great Britain was excited by ambition and not by virtue, and we may yet have much cause to lament the immence sacrifices we have made in vain. In this case I indulge the hope that Virginia will have spirit to oppose a System of domination though she should be the only dissenting State. By doing this she may be the happy instrument of obliging the others to return to their duty as she was the first that dared to counteract British oppression. If she cannot immediately stop the current of despotism, she may check its rapidity, and keep alive an enquiry that will increase the wisdom and establish the virtue of her own people without subjecting them to greater evils than must attend a willing subjection to a burthensome newfangled Aristocracy.…"

The complete text of the revised Constitution is in Mfm:Va. The FEDERAL CONSTITUTION amended: or, an ESSAY to make it more conformable to the sense of a majority of the Citizens of the United States. A DECLARATION of RIGHTS, or Fundamentals of Republican Government.1 Whereas the happiness of mankind, essentially depends upon the principles of government, which have been adopted, or may gradually be received by the societies in which they live; and whereas the fundamental rules of a civil society, have the same tendency to encrease the virtuous dispositions of good Governors, and restrain the vices of bad ones, as any other principles of morality have to form the manners and characters of individuals:—Therefore we the people of the United States, by our representatives in full and free convention assembled have maturely resolved on the following DECLARATION of RIGHTS, as the basis of our government. 1. That all men are by nature free and independent, and have certain inherent and unalienable rights, namely the enjoying and defending life and liberty; acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. 2. That the duty of worshipping Almighty God, of enquiring after, and possessing the truth, according to the dictates of conscience, is equally incumbent on all mankind: That for the more general diffusion of benevolence, hospitality, and undissembled honesty, among all ranks of people, the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession, and worship without preference, shall forever hereafter be allowed within the United States. 3. That the nature and divine end of all power, is to promote the happiness of mankind; that all civil power is vested in, and derived from the people; all magistrates, and rulers, and their trustees and deputies, and are at all times accountable to them. 4. That the best form of government, is that which will produce the greatest common good, with the least danger, trouble, and expence, to individuals, and will most effectually guard against mal-administration; [773]and when any government is found inadequate to these purposes, the people have a right to alter or abolish the same. 5. That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; wherefore no title or place of honor, or profit, should be hereditary. 6. That the freedom of the people essentially depends on their making their own laws. Therefore all elections ought to be frequent and free, and all men having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with an attachment to the community, have the right of suffrage: inequality, and all kinds of restraint, bribery and corruption in elections, is destructive of freedom, and ought to be guarded against. 7. That every individual in society has a right to be protected by it, in the enjoyment of life, liberty, property, and reputation, and ought to find a certain remedy against all injuries, or wrongs, obtaining his right freely, without purchase, completely without denial, and promptly without delay, according to law. 8. That in all capital, or criminal prosecutions, every person has a right to be heard by himself, or his council, to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses, to call for evidence in his favor, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the vicinage, without whose consent, he cannot be found guilty: nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor can any man be deprived of his liberty, but by the laws of the land or judgment of his peers. 9. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor punishments inflicted exceeding the nature of the crime; for if punishments were proportioned to crimes, humanity, instead of pleading for the criminal, would call for their execution. 10. Every person has a right to hold himself, his house, papers, and possessions free from search or seizure, therefore general warrants to seize any person or his property, without evidence of an act committed, and a particular description of his offence, are grievous and oppressive and ought not to be granted. 11. That the people have a right to the freedom of speech, of writing, and publishing their sentiments; therefore printing presses shall not be subject to restraint, other than liableness to legal prosecution, for false facts printed and published. 12. Laws made to punish for actions which have not been declared crimes, by preceding laws, are inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government. 13. The people have a right to keep and bear arms, for the national [774]defence; standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, therefore the military shall be subordinate to the civil power. 14. The community have a right to require of every individual his personal services when necessary for the common defence, and to demand a just and equal portion of his property for public uses in consideration of the protection which he enjoys. 15. In order to preserve the blessings of liberty, frequent and stated recurrence must be had to fundamental principles, and a firm adherence must be maintained, to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, industry, and virtue.

The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State;—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.… The Trial of all Crimes causes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State, where the said Crimes shall cause of action arose, or where the crime may have been committed; but when not committed within without any of the States, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Article. IV. Section. 3. New States may be containing a suitable extent of territory, and a number of inhabitants equal at least to some one of the original states, shall in due time be established in the western country, and admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Section. 4. The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. Article. V The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds a majority of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths two-thirds of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths two-thirds thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of it’s equal Suffrage in the Senate.

The declaration of rights, be made part of this constitution, and considered as fundamental laws, not to be violated, on any pretence whatever. This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers; both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no other religious Test shall ever be required, as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States than a belief in the one only true God, who is the rewarder of the good, and the punishment of the evil. Article. VII. The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, so many of the states, as may contain two-thirds of the citizens of the whole; represented in full and free convention, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution, between the States so ratifying the Same as a compact, or perpetual bond of union, for all inhabitants of the United States."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,George Mason,,,5/7/1788,"Your son delivered me the letter that you were pleased to write me on the 30th instant,2 and I have promoted his views, as far as it is in my power at present, by directing the tobacco I had intended to sell in the country, to be put on board his vessel. I am inclined to think, for the reasons assigned by him, that the French market will be as good a one, at least, as any that we can send to. Give me leave now, dear sir, to make a few observations on the important business that will call you to Richmond next month. It seems pretty clear at present, that four other States, viz. North Carolina, New York, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, will depend much upon Virginia for their determination on the Convention project of a new constitution; therefore it becomes us to be very circumspect and careful [785]about the conduct we pursue, as, on the one hand, every possible exertion of wisdom and firmness should be employed to prevent danger to civil liberty, so, on the other hand, the most watchful precaution should take place to prevent the foes of union, order, and good government, from succeeding so far as to prevent our acceptance of the good part of the plan proposed. I submit to you, sir, whether, to form a consistent union of conduct, it would not be well for six or eight leading friends to amendments to meet privately,3 and, having formed the best possible judgment of the members’ sentiments from knowledge of the men, to see how far it may be safe to press either for modes of amendment or the extent of amendments, and to govern accordingly. But, certainly, the firmest stand should be made against the very arbitrary mode that has been pursued in some states, that is, to propose a question of absolute rejection or implicit admission. For though it is true that the convention plan looks something like this, yet I think every temperate man must agree that neither the convention, nor any set of men upon earth, have or had a right to insist upon such a question of extremity. To receive the good and reject the bad is too necessary and inherent a right to be parted with. As some subtle managers will be upon the convention, I believe you will find entrapping questions proposed at first as a ground-work of proceeding, which will hamper, confine, and narrow all attempts to proper investigation or necessary amendment, and this will be done under the plausible pretext of losing all by attempting any change. I judge that it will be so here, because I observe a similar conduct has been pursued in other places, as in Maryland and Pennsylvania. I trust that such uncandid and dangerous stratagems will be opposed and prevented in the convention of Virginia, and a thorough, particular, and careful examination be first made into all its parts as a previous requisite to the formation of any question upon it. During this process a tolerable judgment may be formed of the sentiments of the generality, and a clue furnished for forming successful propositions for amendment, as the candid friends to this system admit that amendments may be made to improve the plan, but say that these amendments ought to be made, and may be obtained from the new Congress without endangering a total loss of the proposed constitution. I say that those who talk thus, if they are sincere, will not object to this plan, which, as I propose it, [is] something like the proceeding of the convention parliament in 1688, in the form of ratification, insert plainly and strongly such amendments as can be agreed upon, and say, that the people of Virginia do claim, demand, and insist upon these as their undoubted rights and liberties which they mean not to part with; and if these are not [786]obtained and secured by the mode pointed out in the fifth article of the convention plan, in two years after the meeting of the new Congress, that Virginia shall, in that case, be considered as disengaged from this ratification. Under this proposition a development will be made of the sincerity of those who advocate the new plan, the beneficial parts of it retained, and a just security given to civil liberty. In the fifth article it is stated that two-thirds of Congress may propose amendments, which, being approved by three-fourths of the legislatures, become parts of the constitution. By this mode, the new Congress may obtain our amendments without risking the convulsion of conventions, and the friends of the plan will be gratified in what they say is necessary; the putting the government in motion, when, as they again say, amendments may and ought to be obtained. By this mode, too, in all probability, the undetermined States may be brought to harmonize, and the formidable minorities, in the assenting states, may be quieted. By this friendly and reasonable accommodation, the perpetual distrust and opposition, that will inevitably follow the total adoption of the plan, from the state legislatures, may be happily prevented, and friendly united exertions take place. Much reflection has convinced me that this mode is the best that I have had an opportunity of contemplating. I have, therefore, taken the liberty of recommending it to your serious and patriotic attention; in the formation of these amendments, localities ought to be avoided as much as possible. The danger of monopolized trade may be prevented by calling for the consent of three-fourths of the United States on regulations of trade. The trial by jury, in this state, to be insisted on, as it [is] used under our present government, and confining the supreme federal court to the jurisdiction of law excluding fact. The Massachusetts amendments, except the second, and extending the seventh to foreigners as well as citizens of other States, appear to me to be very good, and for their adoption the aid of that powerful state may be secured.4 The freedom of the press is, by no means, sufficiently attended to by Massachusetts, nor have they remedied the want of responsibility by the impolitic combination of president and senate. It does appear to me, that, in the present temper of America, if the Massachusetts amendments, with those suggested by me,5 being added, and inserted in our ratification as before stated, we may easily agree, and I verily believe that the most essential good consequences would be the result. Affectionately yours,"
Letter,No,George Clinton,Edmund Randolph,,,5/8/1788,"Your Excellency’s letter of the 27th. of December, altho’ it appears to have been committed to the Post Office at Richmond, did not come to my Hands until the 7th. of March. The Act inclosed was immediately communicated to the Legislature, but it was after they had passed their Resolutions for calling a Convention and so near the Close of their Sessions that no Order was taken in Consequence of it.— The System of Government proposed by the federal Convention is an Object of such vast Importance to the Happiness of America that it appears to me essential that the People of the different States cultivate and cherish the most friendly Sentiments towards each other especially during their Deliberations on that interesting Subject. The Convention of this State are to meet at Poughkeepsie on the 17th. of June to take the proposed System into Consideration and I am persuaded they will with great Cordiality hold a Communication with any Sister State on the important Subject and especially with one so respectable in Point of Importance, Ability and Patriotism as Virginia; I think I may venture to assure your Excellency that the people of this State are disposed to keep up that friendly Intercourse and preserve that Unanimity respecting any great Change of Government which appears to be the Object of the Act of your Legislature and which it is the Duty of every good Man to promote and cherish, and I have no Doubt but that our Convention will possess the same Sentiments—As the Session of your Convention will take Place before that of this State they will I presume commence the Measures for holding such Communications as shall be deemed necessary. I cannot refrain expressing a Regret that a similar Conduct has not been observed by the States who have already had the proposed System under Consideration—Friendly Communications on the Subject and temperate Discussions would it is to be presumed have had a most happy Tendency in accomodating it much more to the Sentiments and Wishes of the People of America than is likely to be the Case in the Form it is offered by the general Convention and acceded to by some of the States—Should it be adopted by small Majorities in the larger States we cannot reasonably hope it will operate so as to answer the salutary Purposes designed; for I presume it may be laid down as a certain Truth that no Government can be exercised over this Country in its present Condition that is not supported by the Affections and Confidence of the People in general— As I have no Direction from the Legislature on the Subject of your Communications, your Excellency will be pleased to consider this Letter as expressive of my own Sentiments, but I have at the same time a well founded Confidence that a Majority of the People of the State over which I have the Honor to preside will concur in them."
Newspaper,No,Brutus (VA),,Independent Chronicle (VA),Cassius,5/14/1788,"Mr. DAVIS. SIR, In your Chronicle, of April the 2d, you have furnished the public with a piece under the signature of Cassius, which states that “opinions have been insidiously disseminated, respecting the federal constitution, which are entirely devoid of truth,” &c. Whether this assertion is true or not remains with Cassius to prove, and to shew the impropriety of—The term insidiously may indeed be applied, as Cassius has applied it, abusively, to treat the most decent consideration of a subject, which deeply interesting every freeman of the state requires to be freely and fully discussed—or why was it placed before the public for the consideration of the people? But Cassius will do well to shew by what authority he calls a mere project or proposed plan of government “the Fœderal Constitution”—Were any citizen insidiously to disseminate falsehoods against a government established, there would be occasion for censure, but surely no man of sense or modesty, will arrogate to himself and his associates an exclusive right to give opinions upon a submitted question which essentially concerns the dearest rights [799]of humanity. It is certainly to be lamented, that a subject so momentous as government, cannot be temperately and decently agreed upon, without producing the most illiberal abuse and indecent violation of all good sense and good manners! Mr. Lee had certainly as good a right to give his sentiments of the proposed plan of government, to his friend, as Cassius had to trouble the public with his curious dissertation on parts of Mr. Lee’s letter2—the first objection to which letter Cassius thinks to be what follows—“It has hitherto been supposed a fundamental maxim that in governments rightly balanced, the different branches of legislation should be unconnected, and the legislative and executive powers separated”—The candid reader may observe here that as an American is giving his opinions to an American concerning American government, the principles which reign in the American, and not in the British form of government, should have occupied his mind. In support of Mr. Lee’s opinion, let us, passing over similar declarations in other states, see what is asserted by two of the most considerable states in the union. The Massachusetts bill of rights contains these remarkable words—“In the government of this commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them; the executive shall never exercise the legislative or judicial powers, or either of them; to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.”3 This sensible republic considers the union of either of these powers as producing a government of men and not of laws. The bill of rights or constitution of our country declares, “The legislative, executive, and judiciary departments, shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time.”4 The judgment of the learned Montesquieu will be found analogous to these declarations of Virginia and Massachusetts. This able writer says, “whenever the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or in the same body of magistracy, there can be then no liberty; because apprehensions may arise that the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner. Again, there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. Were it joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary controul, for the judge would then be the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor. ⟨Miserable indeed would be the case,⟩ were the same man or the same body of men, whether of the nobles or the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing [800]the public resolutions, and that of judging the crimes and differences of individuals”5—I may now be allowed to call upon Cassius in his own civil language—“Cassius what say you? are these quotations just or not? I dare you to speak out. I should not, Sir, have produced them, did I not conceive it necessary to convince the world, that you are either totally ignorant of the subject on which you write, or that you have ungenerously attempted to deceive the people against your better information.” It is reasonably to be expected that the good people of America will rather approve of the American ideas of Mr. Lee, than the ill understood British ideas of Cassius. I will not dispute with you Cassius, or with your authority, whether “the negative given to the King (of Great-Britain I suppose you mean) on the proceedings of both houses of parliament, was conceived absolutely necessary to preserve the balance of power, although the King at the same time exercises the whole executive power.” But I think Cassius will find in Lord Clarendon’s history, that both houses of parliament joined in declaring to the people, “that the King of England was obliged by his coronation oath to pass such laws as the people should choose by the two houses of parliament, and that since laws have passed by way of bills they did not find that ever the Kings did deny them, otherwise than is expressed in that usual answer ‘Le Roy l’avisera,’ which signifies rather a suspension than a refusal of the royal assent.”6 It will be very difficult I believe, to find three instances in the course of one hundred years back of any such prerogative being exercised by the Kings of England. However let it be granted, that the British Kings have a negative on the bills proposed by the two houses, and that they have also the executive power, docs it follow that Mr. Lee did not reasonably object to the proposed plan of government which joins the president with the senate in the general discharge of executive powers, when they are both of them branches of the legislature, and in some instances the whole of the legislature, and when at the same time the senate are the sole judges of impeachments, thus rendering responsibility difficult, if not impracticable? Here your favorite constitution of England forsakes you—in that system the King is aided in the exercise of his executive functions by a privy council (not by the house of Lords) the members of which are put in the way of responsibility by being obliged to sign the advice they give in a council book. Doctor Blackstone says that the abuse of the kingly power in making treaties to the detriment of the nation is checked “by the means of parliamentary impeachment for the punishment of such ministers as from criminal motives advise or conclude any treaty, which shall afterwards be judged to derogate from the honor and interest of the nation.”7—Now let me again apply in the civil words of Cassius—“stand forth, thou [801]deliberate deceiver of the public and answer”—If a treaty were made by the president and senate that should be found prejudicial to the interest and honor of the United States, how is punishment to be applied? By impeaching the senate before the senate, who are to judge of their own crimes in this respect, and inflict punishment in themselves? The public will then judge, Cassius, of these your insolent questions proposed to Mr. Lee—“Do you not sincerely believe that the concurrence of the senate with the president in the execution of this power is a happy innovation (innovation on what Cassius?) in the federal constitution? Will it not afford a strong additional security to the people for its faithful performance? Do you not conceive it to be one of the loveliest features of the new constitution?” I will help you to answer these handsome questions yourself by a citation from Cato’s letters, written by very able defenders of public liberty in the early parts of the present century—“Considering what sort of a creature man is, it is scarce possible to put him under too many restraints, when he is possessed of great power: He may possibly use it well; but they act most prudently, who, supposing that he would use it ill, enclose him within certain bounds, and make it terrible in him to exceed them. Men that are above all fear, soon grow above all shame. Rupio pudere et metu, suo tantum inginio utibatur, says Tacitus of Tiberius. Even Nero had lived a great while inoffensively and reigned virtuously. But finding at last that he might do what he would, he let loose his appetite for blood, and committed such mighty, such monstrous, such unnatural slaughters and outrages, as none but a heart bent on the study of cruelty could have devised”8—I would advise you Cassius to read Cato’s letters, they may perhaps inform your mind, which appears at present to be extremely uni[n]formed, and render you a better citizen of a free government than the principles you now profess seem to promise. Are you sure, Cassius, absolutely certain, that a King of England can make a valid treaty that shall contravene the previously established law of the land, whether common or statute, because as you say the law of nations is part of the law of the land.—But so is the law of parliament part of the law of the land, and yet either house of parliament that can make this kind of law, cannot by their single determinations repeal or alter an act of parliament, or the common law. Do you think, Cassius, that the King by treaty can alienate the British dominions? Every man acquainted with the subject will, I believe answer NO. That in such case an act of parliament must give validity to the treaty. Yet by the new plan of government, a treaty made by the president and senate shall be “the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby.”—That seems to be saying in other words that a part shall be [802]greater than the whole—Or that though three branches must make the law, two may destroy it—I apprehend, Cassius, these strictures will prove, even to yourself, that you are but little fitted to give opinions upon government, to the public; where quackery is more surely to be discovered than in the private prescriptions of other professions, and that you have but lightly considered the proposed constitution for the states which you so rudely (I wish I were not compelled to say weakly) support—If you really understand any thing of this latter subject, so adventurous a champion as yourself may give the public satisfactory reasons why a power is given to the new Congress over the times, places and manner of holding elections for representatives; because such a power is capable of the grossest abuse by ordering all the elections of this country to be held at the most inconvenient places, where few can or will attend to vote? Why so ill an opinion of the justice and judges, of our country should be entertained as that citizens of other states and foreigners should have liberty to carry our citizens into the fœderal courts for the most trifling causes? Perhaps you know that England and Scotland are united for every good purpose, and yet that an Englishman cannot originally sue a Scotchman in any court erected by an act of parliament of Great-Britain, although in great cases an appeal may go to the house of Lords? I believe you will find that this degrading idea of our courts is truly original, and that nothing similar to it, is to be found in the history of nations. An Englishman will not allow you to carry him out of his own country for debt, but he may carry a citizen of Virginia to Philadelphia, or wherever the new Congress may appoint, upon every frivolous pretext, and there try him without a jury—because the supreme fœderal court in appeal shall have jurisdiction both “as to law and fact.” Tell us if you please why no declaration is made in form of a bill of rights to secure the freedom of the press, the trial by jury, common law securities in criminal accusations, and to save from violation the rights of conscience? So able an advocate as you for the new constitution may also assign a good reason why Delaware, that pays but a sixty seventh part of the general expences, should vote on a money bill in the senate equally with Virginia that pays a sixth part of the same expences? Perhaps you may satisfy us that another convention cannot be obtained to remedy the defects that are so apparent in this proposed system. Whether Mr. Lee does, or does not, think it worth his while to correct your errors, the government under which we are to live, is too serious a matter to suffer your deceptions and abuse of good characters to pass unnoticed(a)—You should remember, Cassius, that there is a great difference [803]between a railer and a reasoner; that good sense and good manners are essential to good writing. Princess-Anne, April 18, 1788. (a)Will you have the goodness, Cassius, to reconcile this paradox of yours to the public, that the House of Commons has been found by experience a sufficient counterpoise to the kingly powers in England, although the same House of Commons is supposed to be always under the influence of the crown by bribery of different kinds. It will not do to suggest, as you have done, that it will take less money to bribe one hundred than five hundred, because the same argument should persuade America to put their government into the hands of one man, because less money may do to bribe one, than one hundred men!"
Letter,No,John Lamb,Richard Henry Lee,,,5/18/1788,"The Importance of the Subject upon which we address you, we trust will be a sufficient Apology for the Liberty we take. The System of Government proposed by the late Convention to the respective States for their Adoption, involves in it Questions and Consequences in the highest Degree interesting to the People of these States. While we see, in common with our Brethren of the other States, the Necessity of making Alterations in the present existing federal Government, we cannot but apprehend that the one proposed in its Room contains in it Principles dangerous to public Liberty and Safety. It would far exceed the Bounds of a Letter to detail to you our Objections to the proposed Constitution. And it is the less necessary that we should do it, as they are well stated in a Publication, which we take the Liberty of transmitting you in a series of Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican.2 We renounce all Ideas of local Objections and confine ourselves to such only as affect the Cause of general Liberty, and are drawn from those genuine Republican Principles and Maxims, which we consider as the Glory of our Country, and which gave rise to the late glorious Revolution and supported the Patriots of America in supporting it. Impressed with these Sentiments we hold it a Duty we owe our Country our Posterity and the Rights of Mankind to use our best Endeavours to procure Amendments to the System previous to its Adoption— To accomplish this desireable Event it is of Importance that those States who have not yet acceded to the Plan should open a Correspondence, and maintain a Communication—That they should understand one another on the Subject and unite in the Amendments they propose— With this View we address you on the Subject and request a free Correspondence may be opened between such Gentlemen in your State as are of Opinion with us on the Subject of Amendments—We request your Opinion on the Matter and that you would state such Amendments as you judge necessary to be made. We think it would conduce very much to promote Union and prevent Discord and an Hostile Disposition among the States, if a Correspondence could be brought about between the Conventions of your State, New Hampshire and this, who we presume will be in Session at the same time—We have the highest Hopes that such a Measure would [815]produce the happiest Effects—We shall write to New Hampshire and propose it and wish your Convention may be inclined to agree to it3—We have every Reason to believe it will be agreeably to ours.— It is not yet declared who are the Members elected for our Convention. The Ballots are to be counted the last Teusday in this Month—But by the best Information received from the different Counties we have not a Doubt of there being a decided Majority returned who will be opposed to the Constitution in its present Form.4 A number of the leading and influential Characters who will compose the Opposition in our Convention are associated with us. We are anxious to form a Union with our Friends in the other States, and to manifest to the Continent and to the World, that our Opposition to this Constitution does not arise from an Impatience under the Restraint of good Government from local or State Attachments, from interested Motives or Party Prejudice—but from the purer Sentiments of the Love of Liberty, an Attachment to Republican Principles and an Adherence to those Ideas which prevailed at the Commencement of the late Revolution, and which animated the most illustrious Patriots to undertake and persevere in the glorious but arduous Contest.5 In behalf of the federal republican Committee I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedt.

Broadside,No,James Monroe,,,,5/25/1788,"GENTLEMEN, When you did me the honour to elect me into the Convention, to decide for you upon the constitution submitted to the states from Philadelphia, I had not at that time examined it with that attention its importance required, and of course could give you no decided opinion respecting it. Other cares had unavoidably taken my attention from it. After you had reposed that trust in me it became my duty to pay it a more serious attention. Having given it the best investigation that my limited capacity is capable of, and perhaps formed in some measure my opinion respecting it, subject however to alteration when I shall be convinced that I am in an error, I should think myself unpardonable if I withheld it from you. To you it belongs to approve or correct this opinion, for although it would give me pain to be compelled to take a course which my own mind did not approve, yet I have too high a respect for you[r] rights, to[o] just a sense of my duty, and too strong an impression of gratitude for the confidence you have reposed in me, to act contrary to your wishes. Under this impression I have thought proper to make to you the following unreserved [847]communication of my sentiments upon this all important subject. It will readily occur to you that this plan of government is not submitted for your decision in an ordinary way; not to one branch of the government in its legislative character and confined under the constitution to the sphere it has assigned it; but to the people to whom it belongs and from whom all power originates, in convention assembled. In this situation your present state constitution was, or should have been, formed, and in this situation you are of course able to alter, or change it at pleasure. You are therefore to observe that whatever act you now enter into, will be paramount to all others either of law or constitution, and that in adopting this it becomes in reality the constitution of the state, and binding on you as such. Whether it will absolutely annul and do away that of the state is perhaps doubtful; my own apprehension is it will not, except in those cases wherein they disagree; in these it will of course prevail, and controul all the departments of the state government, being the ulterior act of the people. You will therefore perceive it is a subject of great extent and importance upon which you have to decide, and that you owe it to your country, yourselves, and posterity, that it be well examined in all its consequences before it is determined. When we contemplate the causes that might probably have contributed to make it necessary to submit to your decision the propriety of such a change in your political situation, we are naturally led into one of the following conclusions—either that the morals of the people have become corrupted—that the passions of mankind by nature render them unfit for the enjoyment of equal liberty, or that the form of the government itself under which we live is radically defective, and capable of such improvement, as will extend to us its blessings in a higher degree, and make them of longer duration. Believing firmly that the body of the people are virtuous, at least sufficiently so to bear a free government; that it was the design of their Creator in forming such an order of beings that they should enjoy it, and that it is only by a strange and unaccountable perversion of his benevolent intentions to mankind, that they are ever deprived of it, I will proceed to examine the latter hypothesis which supposes such defects in the present form, as to make a change adviseable. If we find that they really do exist, I will then proceed to suggest such remedies as will enable us comparitively to determine on the merits of that proposed to be substituted in its stead. I feel myself deeply impressed with the importance of this undertaking and am too well acquainted with my own inability, even to hope that I shall conduct myself with propriety through it, but from [848]a sincere desire to establish a perfect good understanding between us, and prevent the possibility of any future anxiety on this subject, I find myself constrained however painful it may be, and however ungracefully I may do it, not only to avow my sentiments respecting it, but the principles on which they are founded. The present states were separate, from their first colonial establishments until the encroachments of Great Britain, compelled them into an union for their defence. But as their combined efforts soon promised to erect them into independent governments, the consideration which had united them for a time, and for the accomplishment of one object only, became perpetual, and the wisdom of their councils suggested the propriety of provisions that would secure them from like dangers for ever—under this impression they entered into the articles of confederation on the ______ day of ______, 178 .1 To this instrument or bond of union therefore we are to look for the strength, or imbecility, for the perfection or demerits, of the present fœderal government. As this is the system whose defects we have to remedy, it will be proper to present to your view concisely a summary of its powers. The powers which have been given by these articles of agreement or confederation to the general government are extensive.2 They are to be found principally in the 9th and the 6th articles, in the former positively, and in the latter negatively by a qualification of the rights of the individual states. By the 9th, the United States are authorised to make war and peace—send and receive ambassadors—enter into treaties and alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legislature of the respective states shall be restrained from imposing such duties on foreigners as their own people are subject to, or from prohibiting the importation or exportation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever—establishing rules for deciding what captures shall be legal by land and water, and how appropriated; grant letters of marque and reprisal in time of peace-appoint courts for determining finally in all cases of captures; appoint courts for the decision of territorial controversies between states and individuals claiming lands under different grants from two or more states, whose jurisdictions respecting such lands have already been adjusted by the said court;—coin and regulate exclusively the value of coin throughout the United States—fix the standard of weights and measures—regulate the trade with the Indians not members of a particular state—establish and regulate post-offices—appoint all officers of land and sea forces, except regimental; make rules for their government and regulation and direct their operations—ascertain the necessary [849]sums of money to be raised for the service of the United States appropriate, and apply the same—borrow money and emit bills of credit on the faith of the United States—build and equip a navy—agree on the number of land forces and make requisitions for the same. Provided that none of the said powers shall be exercised without the consent of nine states. By the 6th, the individual states are prohibited from sending or receiving embassies, entering into conferences, treaties or alliances with any foreign power, and the servants of the United States or individual states from holding offices of profit or trust under any foreign prince or potentate whatever—from partial confederacies without consent of Congress—from keeping up troops or vessels of war in time of peace except such as shall be approved by Congress-entering into a war with a foreign power unless invaded by an enemy—from granting letters of marque or reprisal except after declaration of war by the United States and then under particular restrictions only. These articles give all the efficient powers to the United States—The 1st, 3d, 4th, 7th and 8th, although they establish some fundamental principles on which the government is to move, and especially the 8th the rule of apportionment, yet they give no real power; they are rather the rule by which the power already given is to be used than that they give any themselves. The 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th, fall still more under this exception or regulate other inferior objects of compact. But the 2d and 5th are of a different impression. By the former, each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, not expressly delegated to the United States and by the latter, that of appointing, continuing, or removing its own delegates at pleasure. These are the powers, and this the form, of the present government. An attentive view of the subject will satisfy us that these powers are really great and extensive; they appear to have contemplated the greater part of those concerns wherein it might be supposed they had a national interest. Having made the United States the sovereign arbiters of war and peace, given them the right to require men and money, equip fleets and armies, to send and receive ambassadors, make treaties of alliance and commerce, with the very extensive catalogue which I have already enumerated, except the regulation of trade there seemed to be little left of external policy to the individual states. It is not my object to inquire here whether these powers should be more extensive. I may in the course of these observations; at present I shall examine more particularly the effect or operation of a government organised like this. It is to be observed that by the 2d article the individual states retain [850]their respective sovereignties, jurisdictions and rights in all cases not expressly ceded to the confederacy. And by the 5th they reserve the right of appointing, continuing or removing their respective delegations at pleasure. To these articles we are to look for the tone and character of this government, for upon these does its good or bad qualities depend. It is upon this point, that the present commotion hath taken place in America, and upon the merits of which we have to decide. The deputies from each state being amenable for their conduct, and depending on it for their hopes and prospects, necessarily negociate for its interests. This property or distinction pervades the whole body, and thus their general council or the Congress becomes a diplomatick corps, or a corps formed of ministers or representatives from sovereign states acting for the particular advantage of that to which they belong. The efforts therefore of each state, whatever may be the powers of the union over the several members that compose it, will be to shield itself from the common burdens of the government; and to effect this all the arts of intrigue and negociation will be constantly exerted. What is the obvious course of a government organised on such principles? Are not the seeds of dissolution deeply ingrafted in it? The most powerful principles of human action the hope of reward and the fear of punishment are in the hands of each state, and whilst mankind are subject to their influence, or the passions and affections of the human heart continue as they have been, its course will always be the same. This government it is manifest can never be an efficient one. Strong necessity and emminent danger may make it so occasionally, but whenever this cause ceases to operate, its repellent principles will prevail. If this position is just, I am perhaps right in supposing it a consequence necessarily resulting from it, that the stronger the powers of the government are, the more repellent will its qualities be, and the sooner its dissolution; at least certain it is that the conflict between the general and state governments, will be proportionally more violent, and its or their ruin the sooner accomplished, for it must soon terminate either in that of the one or the other, I mean as an efficient government. The higher toned those of the states were the more rapid would the progress be. I think I may venture to affirm that a confederacy formed of principalities would not last long, for the pride of princes would not brook those familiarities and insults which a free discussion of rights and interests, especially if they interfere, sometimes unavoidably occasions; and when an absolute prince takes offence he wields the state with him. But this is not the case with democracies, for although their chief magistrates may be offended, yet it is difficult for them to [851]communicate at the same time, the same passions and dispositions to the whole community which they themselves possess. This is a caution however which I hope it is not necessary to suggest here, for I am satisfied the state governments will never take this turn of themselves, nor whilst that of the confederacy is preserved and properly supported. But to carry this government a little further into practice. Let us submit the concerns and interests of different states or individuals within them to this corps formed of representatives from each negociating for that to which they respectively belong, and what kind of justice may we expect from its decisions? If magazines were to be established or troops raised and stationed in some quarter of the union for public defence, might we not expect that these arrangments would take stronger byas, from the combination of the day, than any sentiment of propriety? If states or individuals within them had claims founded on the same principles with those upon which a decision had already been had in favour of others, are we to calculate with certainty upon a similar decree? In short apply it to every case that may possibly arise, either of states or individuals, in the full scope of its powers, and we shall find its decisions depend, more upon negociation, the bargain of the day, than any established maxim of justice or policy. On the other hand how are its treaties, laws, or ordinances to be carried into effect? Are they of authority and in force immediately within the states as soon as they are passed? Or does it require the intervention of a state law to give them validity? And if the law is necessary may not the state refuse to pass it, and if she does how shall she be compelled? It is well known from the practice of all the states in the confederacy that no act of Congress, of what nature soever it may be, is of force within them, until it is recognized by their own legislatures, prior to that event it is a nullity, and to that only does it owe its authority. This view of the subject demonstrates clearly that the present government, in its ordinary administration, though a league of independent states for common good, and possessed of extensive powers, must always be void of energy, slow in its operation, sometimes oppressive, and often altogether suspended—that it can never be calculated on by foreign powers, and of course that they will form no treaties or compacts whatever with it, that stipulate any thing, at least on equal terms, that in fine very little dependence can be placed in it by the states themselves, for destitute of the power of coercion, to say nothing as to the justice or propriety of the measures themselves, these will not be forward to comply with its demands, whilst those may refuse with impunity. On the other hand the illustrious event which hath [852]placed them in the rank of independent states demonstrates with equal certainty, that it is competent to external defence, and perfect security from abroad, for how otherwise could it have been atchieved? These are the defects or the principal defects in the form of the present government, and they are inseparable from a league of independent states, for to that circumstance, and that alone they are to be attributed. We have then to weigh these evils, and compare them with the probable benefits and dangers that may accompany a change, and then see in which scale the balance preponderates. It may be now asked are we reduced to this alternative either to subvert the state sovereignties or submit to these evils? Is the state sovereignty a vain and illusory hope, is it incompatible with its own and the general interests of the confederacy? Or is there any other alternative? The practice of nations and the field of enquiry is open before us, and we have every thing that is sacred and dear to mankind depending on the event. Two species of remedy only present themselves to my mind, and these contemplate either a complete annihilation of the state governments, or a partial one or considerable reduction of their powers. A complete annihilation and the organization of a general government over the whole, would unquestionably remove all the objections which have been stated above, and apply to it as a fœderal government; and I will be free to own that if it were in reality a practicable thing, there is no object which my mind has ever contemplated, the attainment of which would give it such high gratification. To collect the citizens of America, who have fought and bled together, by whose joint and common efforts they have been raised to the comparitively happy and exalted theatre on which they now stand; to lay aside all those jarring interests and discordant principles, which state legislatures if they do not create, certainly foment and increase, arrange them under one government and make them one people, is an idea not only elevated and sublime, but equally benevolent and humane. Whether it contains within it a territory as extensive as the Russian or German empires, or is confined in its operation to the narrow scale of their smallest principallities or provinces, yet it is the business of state legislation to pursue its destined course “the interests of those who live under it.” For a legislature to contemplate other objects, and make a sacrifice of their own for the good of other people, or even decline availing itself of the legitimate exercise of its powers for that purpose, upon every opportunity which chance or fortune may present in its way, is a degree of liberality to which the human heart hath not as yet attained. A society of philosophers of the antient stoick sect might perhaps be capable of such extended philanthropy, [853]but this sect is now altogether at an end, and at its height, never formed but an inconsiderable part of any community, and was by all the rest of the world considered as affecting objects without the pale of human nature. How much more delightful therefore is it to the mind to contemplate one legislature organized over the whole continent, containing all the free inhabitants of the American states within it, nourishing, protecting, and promoting their interests in every line and extending its genial influence to every part; commerce flourishing, arts encreasing, lands rising in value, with all those other happy concomitants that attend a well formed and wisely directed government, than thirteen different legislatures, in pursuit of local objects, acting upon partial and confined considerations, without system or policy, jealous of their particular rights, dissatisfied with, and preying upon each other. If it were practicable, I should embrace this change with the utmost pleasure, and consider it the goal at which all our efforts should bend, the polar star that should direct all our movements. I should consider the abolition of the state legislatures as a most fortunate event for America, and congratulate my country on the commencement of a new aera in her affairs from whence to date the dawn of better hopes and happier days. But is it practicable, can it be accomplished? Can a legislature be organized upon such principles as to comprehend the territory lying between the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, the Lakes, and the Atlantic ocean, with such a variety of soil and climate, contain within it all the vital parts of a democracy, and those provisions which the wisdom of ages has pointed out as the best security for liberty, and be at the same time a strong, efficient, and energetic government? Would it be possible to form in every respect a complete consolidation of interest and how otherwise would its operation affect the weaker party? Or to accommodate its legislative acts so as to suit those of a local kind that were variant in the nature of things? To form a system of revenue, by direct taxation and excise, regulate the mode of collection, supervise it, without the establishment of a train of officers, and tribunal under tribunal, that would not be enormously expensive, free from more than ordinary imposition, and preserve the spirit of the government? Seperated at the distance of near 1200 miles, suppose the dispositions to do right the best that nature can infuse into the human heart, generally speaking in the operation of the government, will the man of Georgia possess sufficient information to legislate for the local concerns of New-Hampshire? Or of New-Hampshire for those of Georgia? Or to contract it to a smaller space of New-York for those of Virginia? Will not of course most of its measures be taken upon an imperfect view of the subject? A wise legislator should possess a precise knowledge [854]of the situation and interests of all the territory and of the state of society, manners, and dispositions of the people within it committed to his care. Some men perhaps to whom a kinder fortune had dispensed her more liberal gifts, who had devoted their earlier life to travels, general science, and those researches that were particularly necessary for it, might succeed, but unfortunately for us the most sanguine admirer of this plan, could not promise to America that her national councils, should always be filled with men of this stamp. I would not wish to discolour this plan of a complete national government, acting in all cases for the common good, to the exclusion of subordinate legislatures, so delightful in theory, with the reverse of this picture, nor to depaint those consequences which might result from its maladministration, if instead of the best qualities that are the portion of humanity, it should be its fortune to have its councils filled, with men remarkable for their ignorance, or any great malignity of heart, contending against difficulties, under its best form and with its best hopes, which perhaps are insurmountable, what would be its situation and issue in that event? As this subject is of great importance and leads to a decision upon an important trait in the plan of government now before you, it will be proper to give it a more particular investigation. Perhaps an attention for a moment in this respect to those political establishments which have been erected in different quarters of the globe, in antient and modern times, may furnish an instructive lesson, upon the present occasion. In but few instances, and those at distant intervals of time, hath a democracy or government of the people ever been established. To what cause it is to be attributed, philosophers and statesmen may differ, but it is an unquestionable truth, that there hath been a constant effort in all societies, to exterpate it from off the face of the earth. The contest hath been often violent, and the manly exertions which the friends of equal liberty, have made against this disease of human nature, is the great, the instructive subject of history. They have had to contend against difficulties thrown in their way by all ranks of society: If the poor and those in moderate circumstances only, where an union might have been expected had united, a tyranny had never been erected. But the ignorance, the folly, and often times the vices of the lower classes have perhaps favoured this tendency as strongly as the lust for dominion and power in the wealthy. To illustrate this position by a review of the commencement, progress, and decline of those nations with which history furnishes us examples, with the causes that have contributed to hurry them to this their last stage, would not only present to your view a melancholy monument of the weakness of human institutions, but lead me beyond the bounds [855]of the present enquiry. Be assured however there is no fact better established by history, than this tendency or effort in all societies, to defeat the purpose of their own institution, and terminate in despotism. If then we are not the unfaithful guardians of those rights, which an all gracious providence hath bestowed upon us, should we not attend to every circumstance that may contribute to preserve them? And will it be questioned, that the extent of territory is one of those that will have no influence on the subject? The governments that have been purely democratic, to which only we should resort for satisfactory information upon this head, if any ever were, are but few. In several it is true the people have had some share of power, as in that of Rome. But it cannot be questioned that in this the Nobles or aristocracy had the prevailing influence. The endless quarrels between the different branches or rather orders of the people, the Senate and plebians, is perhaps the real cause of the perpetual warfare and extensive conquests, made by this rapacious mistress of the world. When the people became incensed against the Senate, as they often had reason to be, the latter had always sufficient address, to give their passions other objects to act on, by turning them against foreign powers. With this view it seems to have been a political maxim with that branch, in whose hands the executive authority was also lodged, never to be at peace with all nations at the same time, and in this they succeeded tolerably well, for from the commencement to the final dissolution of the empire, the temple of Janus, always open in time of war, if we may credit the tradition of their best historians, was hardly ever closed. But so soon as the whole globe had acknowledged her authority, and bowed beneath the yoke, the immense fabric she had thus raised fell to pieces. External opposition that had raised it to the height it had attained, having ceased, its foundation was taken away. There was no principle within it to unite its parts together. From this it is to be presumed that if her government had been organized upon harmonious principles, and made the people happy under it, her dominion would never have extended over more than one-tenth the territory it did. But be this as it may, the government of Rome acknowledged distinct orders of people, in which indeed the aristocracy prevailed, and can of course furnish no example for us. This may be said of Lacedemon and of Carthage, for according to the opinion of a profound historian and observer on the subject of government, that of Carthage was also divided and the greater portion of power taken from the people and placed in the hands of the aristocracy.(a) If any ever were, Athens, Thebes, and Corinth, were for a time, pure democracies. But shall we draw our conclusion from their example, whose jurisdiction was more [856]confined than that of some of our smallest states? In short, let us contemplate what forms, in what countries and times we please, where the rights of the people, and the spirit of liberty, were in any degree preserved, and we have the most solemn admonition to beware even making the attempt. The monarchy of Britain in which the executive power is armed with almost despotic authority, comprehends within it a territory smaller than that of this commonwealth, and yet it is believed its administration is happier than if it were more extensive. Even the king of France, sensible that his government will be happier for his subjects, and more faithful and beneficial for himself, has shewn a disposition to re-establish the provincial assemblies for this purpose, yet it cannot be denied that his powers are otherwise sufficiently great, or that any monarch was ever, in a greater degree, or more deservedly beloved by his people. But if these examples are not sufficient to warn us of the fatal consequences that will attend the vesting such powers in the Congress, let us turn our attention to those nearer at home, and which perhaps will make a deeper impression on our minds, and do we not behold the province of Maine separating from Massachusetts, Vermont from New York, Wyomin[g] from Pennsylvania, and the district of Kentucky from Virginia, on this very principle, with others no less striking that might be enumerated. It is true the improvement of government under this form, by representation, the discovery of which is attributed to modern times, might make some difference in this respect, but are there no bounds within which it should still be restrained? Shall it attempt things that seem from the concurrent testimony of all history to be the appropriate object of despotism? Maladies that are incurable after they have afflicted the body with ail the pain and anguish incident, to a frail and feverish being, exhausted its efforts, and worn out its constitution, complete the work by terminating its existence. This government too, after having experienced the vicisitudes of fortune that might accompany its natural imperfections, of laws badly formed and indifferently executed, of anarchy disorder and confusion, after having worn out and broken the spirits of the people, would also have its end. But what form it would then assume is left for time to develope. The diseases of every government suggest its remedy. Other circumstances it is true give it a byas, but these have a principal influence in directing its course. Those of the federal system and which owed their birth and enormity to the want of strength in the federal head, had disposed the people to agree to an annihilation of their state governments, which yielded to the present one. Had this change been accomplished, by the designs of wicked and abandoned men, by the usurpations of a [857]tyrant, or the seductions of art and intrigue, it is to be presumed, and the experience of other countries hath approved it, that the people would now return to that they had forsaken, with a degree of zeal and fervor proportioned to the sufferings they had borne.(b) But if a long and patient experience had shewn its defects, a calm and dispassionate appeal had been made to their understandings, and a recollection of the great calamities, it had inflicted on them, demonstrated it was neither calculated, for the care of their liberties, their safety or common interests, they would make a new experiment and take a different course. From the causes above stated the incapacity of the legislative branch to form happy, wise, or uniform laws for the government of a territory so extensive, and of a people in pursuit of objects so opposite in their nature, had perhaps already often clogged its operations and suspended its course. This had gradually alienated the affections of the people and created in them a contempt for this branch of the government. The powers of the executive had of course been proportionably increased, for it is natural for the latter to supply the defects of the former. Accustomed to behold it in miniature, and to derive relief from its friendly interference, the people are at length prepared to have recourse to a Royal government, as the last resort the only safe assylum for the miserable and oppressed. And this perhaps would be the issue of the present ⟨a consolidated⟩ government; and for these reasons I should dread its establishment over these states. For to however low and pitiable a condition we may have fallen; however deservedly we may have acquired the contempt and scorn of nations, yet I had rather submit in peace and quiet, to those reproaches which the proud and disdainful may throw upon us, than by commencing on a stage upon which the fortunes of all nations have been wrecked, however splendid and meteor like our transient exhibition might be, risk the enjoyment of those blessings we now possess. But may not some middle course be struck, some plan be adopted to give the general government those rights of internal legislation necessary for its safety, and well being, in all cases, and yet leave to the states other powers they might exercise to advantage? If by this it is intended to comprehend the right of direct taxation and excise with the absolute controul of the resources of the union, it will be easy to perceive its consequences. Those who are in any degree acquainted with the principles of government, or with those of the human heart well know that upon this point, the equal distribution of the resources of the union, between the two governments, will their balance depend. If you place the whole into the hands of one, it will require no casuistry, no great degree of depth in this science to determine which will preponderate. [858]Acting on the bowels the body will soon decay and die away. The pageant ornaments and trappings of power will not last long, for the reason and good sense of mankind turn with disgust upon the mockery of empty forms. Such an arrangement would therefore in my apprehension, embark us on a more perilous and stormy sea, than even a complete annihilation of the state governments. If then such a government as I have above described in either view presents an impracticable alternative, or such an one as we should not without a nearer and better view of it embrace, the other mode only remains or that which proposes the organization of a general government over the states forming a part of and acknowledged by the constitution of each, leaving at the same time a qualified government in each state for local objects. Let us examine this then since it is the only safe or even plausible course for us to take. To organize a general government, that shall contain within it a particular one for each state, or in other words, to form a constitution for each state, which shall acknowledge that of the union, is no easy thing, for there never was an example of the kind before. The Amphictionic council, Achaean, Belgic, or Helvetic confederacies were but leagues of independent states, somewhat similar to the present one. To mark the precise point at which the powers of the general government shall cease, and that from whence those of the states shall commence, to poise them in such manner as to prevent either destroying the other, will require the utmost force of human wisdom and ingenuity. No possible ground of variance or even interference should be left, for there would the conflict commence, that might perhaps prove fatal to both. As the very being or existence of the republican form in America, and of course the happiness and interests of the people depend on this point, the utmost clearness and perspicuity should be used to trace the boundary between them. The obvious line of separation is that of general and local interests. All those subject[s] that may fall within the former distinction, should be given to the confederacy, and those of the latter retained to the states. If the federal government has a right to exercise direct legislation within the states, their respective sovereignties are at an end, and a complete consolidation or incorporation of the whole into one, established in their stead. For in government it is, as in phisicks, a maxim, that two powers cannot occupy the same space at the same time. Let this therefore be the characteristic line of the division; internal legislation or the management of those concerns which are entirely local shall belong to the states, and that of those which have a foreign aspect, and in which they have a national concern, to the confederacy. In forming a constitution [859]on these principles, the same rule should be observed, that has been informing those of individual states; defining the powers given and qualifying the mode, in which they shall be exercised. All powers not ceded it is true belong to the people; but those given in a constitution are expressed in general terms, as that the Congress shall levy and collect duties; this involves in it the right of making laws for the purpose, for the means are included in the power; otherwise it is a nullity. The species of evidence and the mode of tryal are subordinate objects under it, and does it not follow that the Congress might regulate these at pleasure? How are we secured in the trial by jury? This most excellent mode of tryal which has been found, in those few countries where it has been adopted, the bulwark of their rights, and which is the terror of dispotic governments, for it disarms them of half their power, is but a matter of police, of human invention; if then we gave general powers unless we qualified their exercise by securing this, might they not regulate it otherwise? I would not be understood to insinuate it would be the case, but that it were possible is improper. The spirit of the times might secure the people of America perhaps for a great length of time against it; but fundamental principles form a check, even when the spirit of the times hath changed, indeed they retard and controul it. As it is with the trial by jury so with the liberty of conscience; that of the press and many others. As to the powers themselves, the distinction being drawn, the enumeration would be of course. To those of the former Congress some few might be added, or from those of the constitution, some few taken away, for nominally there is not so great a difference between them as some people suppose. To the former for instance, let the absolute controul of commerce with the revenues arising from it be added. Let the right of apportionment be as in the constitution, for the ground on which the states have met on that point is certainly a happy compromise being that indeed which had been long recommended by Congress.3 Let them regulate the disciplining and training of the militia—the calling them forth and commanding them in service; for the militia of a country, is its only safe and proper defence. All countries are more or less exposed to danger, either from insurrection or invasion and the greater the authority of Congress over this respectable body of men, in whose hands every thing would be safe, the less necessity there would be, to have recourse to that bane of all societies, the destroyer of the rights of men, a standing army. But it may be urged the revenues from the impost would not be sufficient for national purposes, and that without the right of direct taxation, the government would be forced to have recourse, to the expedient of requisitions, the inefficacy of which had [860]already been sufficiently experienced. The position in the first instance, as to the insufficiency of the revenues is doubtful; but the apprehension of the states neglecting requisitions under this, as they have done under the late government still more so.4 When the United States became in effect a national government, by being incorporated with those of the states, possessed considerable revenue, had at their command a fleet and army, with the absolute controul of trade; I cannot but believe that their constitutional demands, or requisitions, would be complied with. Let the individual states also be restrained from exercising improper powers, making war, emitting paper bills of credit and the like. All restraints that were necessary for the wise administration of a good and virtuous government, would have my ready assent. It is not my intention to draft a form, a general idea is all I aim at, and in this perhaps I am tedious. Having defined the powers, marked the line between, and secured as far as possible the harmony of the two governments, by making the former a part of the latter, it will be necessary to organize it upon such principles, as to secure the wisdom and happiness of its administration; for I presume it does not necessarily follow, because the constitutional acts of the government will be executed and become the laws of the land in each state that our researches should be at an end, and that we should conclude we had remedied all the defect[s] of the present one. On the contrary our anxiety should be increased tenfold. From that our safety was to be attributed to its imbicility; but from this we should not be able to shelter ourselves under that protection. We should therefore be the more zealous, proportioned to the prize we have at [s]take, to distribute the powers and poize the government, so as to secure equal justice in all its acts, to every part of the confederacy; for wretched and forlorn will the condition of that be, which shall not find itself equally secure under the protection, and in the enjoyment of its blessings, with every other part. From royalty <despotism> itself, where the power is concentered in but one person, fluctuating in its systems and unsettled in its course, sometimes a ray of benevolence and even of justice is reflected on those whom it had marked out as the object of its resentment. Nature has cast into but few characters such malign and unfriendly dispositions, that their revenge cannot be satiated. But from a combination of states, acting systematically in pursuit of particular and local interests, wielding in their hands the powers of the government, and of course secure not only from censure but of the approbation and applause of those whom they served, however severely the attainment of the objects it contemplated, might bear upon the interests of the unfortunate minority, yet [861]from their justice, it is to be feared, that neither moderation nor even mercy could be expected. But the present system is that we have to remedy and we should never loose sight of its defects. If the new government should be organized in the same manner with the old, consist of one branch only, each state appoint her own delegates and recall them at pleasure, I am satisfyed it would in the administration in Congress, or passage of the acts, be found in the experiment in that respect, just such a government as the other. There would be the same negociation, intrigue and management for the advantage of each state that now prevails. Its movements would be as slow and its decisions as unjust as they sometimes have been. In short it would still be a government of states in every respect and not a national one. How then shall we guard against, check and controul this intolerant and destructive state spirit? How infuse into all its departments a love, respect, and dread of the whole, for upon this [e]very thing depends? It has been long established by the most celebrated writers, but particularly illustrated and explained by the President Montesquieu and Mr. Locke, that the division of the powers of a government over one state, or one people only, into three branches, the legislative, executive, and judiciary, is absolutely necessary for the preservation of liberty.5 This is now admitted by all who are not the friends of despotism, and I am persuaded it has already been demonstrated in the course of these observations, that such a division is, if possible, more necessary in a government to be organized over more than one. Taking this position then as established, I will proceed to an examination of the principles upon which this organization should be formed. If the states as such or in their legislative character appoint any of the officers of this government, the effect will be the same, provided the rotative principle is preserved, which will I hope never be given up, that has already been experienced; for in the appointment is involved that of responsibility. It should therefore proceed from the people immediately, or by means of electors chosen for the purpose. This will make them amenable to the people only for their conduct, or to such constitutional tribunals where they arc practicable, as they shall establish to take cognizance of offences. This we apprehend would contribute much to the establishment of a national government; each would move in the sphere the constitution had appointed for it, and be accountable to the people only for their conduct, the high and pure source, from whence they respectively derived their authorities. The legislative branches are in all democratic governments, and of course would be so in this, the immediate representatives of the people. [862]They should therefore be kept as dependent on them as possible, having in all respects the same interests with themselves. For offences in these branches the general government can provide no punishment, for there can be no tribunal under it, to take cognizance of them. Charges of corruption or prosecutions for it, or other offences, committed by those in these branches, should not be allowed from those in the others, for this might either unite them in mal-practices against their country, or create endless strife between them, and thereby destroy the balance of the government. A free people are the only proper judges of the merits of those who serve them, and they only should bring them to justice. This shews the necessity of frequent elections. The members of each should in my opinion return to the body of the people, those of the house of representatives at the expiration of every two years, and those of the senate of every four years, capable however always of re-election. Both these branches should if possible be filled on the principles of representation from all the states. For the house of representatives, the rule adopted in the constitution, is perhaps the proper one. Let twice that number, or a still greater ratio of numbers to that of representation, be the rule for the senate. The members of both branches should be incapable of appointment to other offices whilst in these, otherwise a wide door will be left open for corruption. This is not an idle or visionary precaution, but in a great measure the pivot, upon which the upright and faithful administration of the government will depend. The experience of Britain hath demonstrated, how often the most valuable interests of the people, have been bartered away, by leading members of the house of commons for a seat in the house of peers, or some lucrative office in the government; how much greater then should our apprehension be, of danger in the present instance, when we recollect that the government is organized upon such principles as to acknowledge no responsibility to the states, and comprehends within it such an extent of territory, as to put it out of the power of those who inhabit its extremities, to have any knowledge of the conduct of their servants! The possibility of this kind of traffic should therefore be absolutely prohibited. But the power of the legislature should be confined to those objects, which were intirely legislative in their nature, as the regulation of trade, requisitions for money, and the like. The soundest authorities and the melancholy experience of our state governments have shewn the propriety of this restraint, in a constitution over one state, and for reasons that are obvious the expedience, will be the more urgent, in the present instance. Its natural effort in all cases is, to grasp to itself all the powers delegated from the people,(c) and to prostrate the other branches before [863]it; stimulated on by the state spirit, which will in some degree still remain, the difficulty here will be proportionably increased. The ingenuity of man can devise no other, without an appeal to the people, which if possible should always be avoided, than that of giving the Executive, the other active branch an absolute negative on the laws; for otherwise its enterprizes must be successful. Many restraints might be disignated by the constitution, but without effect. And from this at the same time that it preserved the balance of the government, no injury could be sustained. Against the encroachments of the Executive the fears and apprehensions of the whole continent would be awake, with a watchful jealousy they would observe its movements. But against the legislature (if we may reason by analogy of that branch in this) from those in other governments, no such apprehensions could be entertained. Its movements comparitively would be accompanied with the confidence of the people. Every incroachment upon its rights would be popular. In every contest between them it must of course yield the ground. In short unless the Executive had a negative on the laws of the legislature, it would soon exist only in name. The right of impeachment and the mode of trial are of the first importance in this government. The former, if with the people or even the states themselves, would never be exerted or greatly abused; it should therefore belong to the house of representatives. And the latter should be vested in a court of that high confidence and respectability of character, as to partake of none of those passions that sway the bulk of mankind. Unconnected by office, and of course no way interested in the event; unacquainted with the crime except as it might appear before them by satisfactory testimony, they should hear calmly and judge dispassionately upon the merits of the cause. From their decision the guilty would receive a fair condemnation, or the innocent be restored again to the confidence of their country, and the people return satisfied that their passions had been awakened, and their fears alarmed without any just foundation. The sentence should be final, and not shifted off to another tribunal. A further prosecution may appear odious, and the just resentments of the people calm away, and totally subside. For these reasons the senate should form the court of impeachment. But although the legislative branch shall be elected by the people, and amenable to them alone for their conduct, yet as the state sovereignties though qualified, will still remain, and of course the state spirit, in contradiction to a federal one, from necessity be more or less influential in its councils, we should turn our attention to the other branches of the government, as our firm resource. The Executive [864]is that upon which, in many respects, we should rest our hopes, for an equal, a federal, and a wise administration. Every possible effort should therefore be used to expell from the hearts of those who fill it, a preference of one part of the community to another. The experience of other governments hath taught us, it is possible to devise checks, which from motives of policy and private interest, will even make bad men faithful public servants. The prospect of reward and the fear of punishment, as has already been observed, arc the most powerful incentives to virtuous action. It should therefore be so organized, as to give every quarter indeed every man of the union, under the influence of these principles, as to those who fill it, an equal access to the human heart, whenever this equipoise is destroyed, and this high character taught to look up to this, or that state, or combination of states for the smiles or the frowns of government, from that moment will its oppression be felt, and a dreadful anarchy insue. And if you take from those whom the choice of their country hath called forth to this high station, the hope of further favour, and mark to them the extent of service, after the completion of which the door shall be forever closed upon them, in that degree will you deprive yourself of one of the principal instruments by which you are to preserve the equilibrium, and secure the public safety. Discharged forever from the service of the United States, will not the approbation of the union, cease to be the ruling passion, and an accommodation to state interests take its place and influence many of the public measures? For these reasons I could wish to see the right of impeachment, extended upon as liberal ground as possible, given for instance to the representatives of one third of the confederacy; and I could likewise wish to see the citizen at the head of this department, capable of re-election at the expiration of his service which should be at the end of every three or four years, so long as he should merit the confidence of his country. The mode of election should also be a fundamental in the organization of this branch. If the command of this office was placed within the reach of court influence, the most alarming consequences were to be apprehended from it. If the ultimate decision should happen at the metropolis, it is easy to be perceived what an opportunity this would present for venality and corruption. It must be a great object particularly for either France or Britain to have the friend of their respective courts in this office, possessed of such extensive powers and which might dispense such important favours to them. The influence of the presiding magistrate himself, especially within the town in which he had for some time resided, and to whose citizens he had rendered many substantial services, and who of course would be averse to the [865]introduction of a novus homo among them, would not be inconsiderable. In addition to which it is to be observed, that it forms a departure from a principle which should prevail through the whole, but particularly in the organization of this branch, a dependance of this officer, for every thing estimable among mankind, upon the people of America. By the people therefore should the appointment be made, not in person, but by the means of electors chosen for the purpose. To prevent the possibility of any interference, or byas on their free election, that of the electors by the people, should be on the same day in every state, and that of the President by the electors likewise on the same day and at some specified place in each, unless an invasion, or other extraordinary circumstance should prevent it; in which case perhaps the electors themselves, or the executive of the state might appoint some other. Whatever time might be employed in this mode of election is immaterial; it is of the first importance, and should never be dispensed with, that he be thus appointed. But high power⟨s⟩ in the Executive branch require in every respect, a direct and immediate responsibility; for although it should be so organized as that whilst to those who fill it, and act with propriety in the discharge of its functions, the door should be left open for a continuance of public favour, yet the sword of justice should be held constantly suspended over the heads of those, who shall be convicted of having basely sacrificed the interests, or made attempts upon the liberties of their country. There should be no constitutional restraint, no equivocation of office, to shield a traitor from the justice of an injured people. No circumstance to blunt or turn aside the keen edge of their resentment. With the charge should the powers of his office cease. He should stand alone unsupported, and unprotected except by the integrity of his heart and the rectitude of his conduct. For these reasons the executive power should be vested altogether in one person; unrestrained by a constitutional council, its operations will be more easy and regular, and its responsibility the greater and more immediate. And for these reasons if there is a constitutional council it must be from its nature the most improper tribunal, that can be formed or conceived, for the tryal of the offences of the principal, since they must be either partakers of the crime, or some way or other a party interested in it. With an Executive organized on these principles, being independent of the legislature, and in a very responsible situation, I should be well content to intrust great powers, because I should calculate with tolerable certainty upon an honest and a wise execution of them. The constitution perhaps suggests those, with some exceptions that are [866]proper; whether it would be safe to give it the absolute controul of the fleet and army at all times, in peace and war, the ordering them out, and laying them by, without consent of the legislature, or even knowledge, is at least doubtful. In Great Britain this power may be committed to the King with propriety; but he is the Lord of hereditary-dominions, and transmits the inheritance in his line forever. By betraying his trust he might lose his crown, and perhaps gain nothing, even if he established despotism. But with the President who perhaps depends on a quadriennial election the case is different. It is certainly a formidable power to place in the hands of any one public servant. I would however in no event interpose the opinion of the legislature, so as to controul the movements of these forces, but merely to affix the condition, or emergency, upon which his absolute power over them should commence. As I would repose the whole trust of this department in one officer, so he alone should be responsible for all its transactions. He might associate whom he pleased, of the wise men of America in his councils, but they should be of his own association. An allowance might be made him, to compensate them for their services, for which he should be accountable. Controversies between independent nations are usually settled by the sword. It is to the misfortune of mankind that no tribunal has ever been established to adjust their interfering claims, and inforce its decrees. It has been the defect of all other confederacies, of whose institutions history has given us any account, that although attempts in some have been made in this respect to preserve the harmony, and lessen the calamities of mankind, yet the courts to whom their controversies have been submitted, the council or representative body of each, have not been organized on such principles as to insure justice in all their decisions. To this circumstance perhaps many of their calamities were to be attributed. The framers of the confederation in some degree also fell into this error for those only of a territorial kind were to be submitted to a fœderal court.6 Under that form its inconvenience has been often very sensibly felt, but under the present it would be insupportable. Great care should therefore be used, in the organization of this branch, to remedy this defect. The judiciary in this, as in all free governments, should be distinct from, and independent of the other branches, and equally permanent in its establishment. Performing its appropriate functions, the extent of its authority should be commensurate with theirs. As it forms the branch of a national government, so it should contemplate national objects only. Whatever cases might arise under the constitution, the laws of the legislature, and the acts of the Executive in conformity thereto, [867](however trifling or important the interests it affected might be) should have their final decision from this court. All cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls—of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction—all controversies between different states—between the United States and a state—a state and the citizens of another state, citizens of the same state claiming lands under different states, should of course be submitted to its decision. In cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction; in the other cases above mentioned appellate jurisdiction as to law only, and from the Supreme Courts of the respective states. The laws of the United States becoming under the constitution those of each state, their courts of course take cognizance of them, from whose decisions, the object of the union will be completely answered by an appeal to their court as to law only, and with great accommodation to the interests of the people. In the organization of this branch, the object should be to found it on the state establishments, and not independently of them, for in the latter case new and very extraordinary difficulties present themselves to view, among which the clashing of jurisdictions would perhaps be the least important. The judges should be appointed by the President, who would of course take them from among the meritorious of our citizens in the different quarters of the union. Having shewn the defects of our present federal system, pointed out those remedies or amendments both as to its powers, and their distribution or organization, that have appeared to me advisable, I am naturally led in conformity to the plan I had laid down in the beginning of these observations, into a more minute comparison or examination, of the constitution now before you, by the standard or test of those principles I have endeavoured to establish. And this I will confess, is the most painful part of the present enquiry. But where there is a contrariety of sentiment, in any degree, there can be no other mode of investigation; and it is I am persuaded the fairer course, for if the principles themselves cannot be supported it necessarily results, that all reasoning or deductions from them fall to the ground. It may be recollected that I have not objected to any of those powers which were necessary to add, to the energy, strength, resource, or respectability of the government, but have fought to divest it of those only which I conceived it could never exercise, were impracticable, and whilst they remained even if not brought forth into action, would lessen it in the confidence of the people, but if ever exerted prove the source of endless strife between the states and the general government, that must terminate in the ruin of either the one or the [868]other, which I have considered, (perhaps improperly) as a great national calamity. Those to which I have particularly alluded are the right of direct taxation and of excise through all the states; and the more I have reflected on this subject the better satisfied I have been, that if the other powers were vested in it, and the government made as thereby it would be, strong, energetic and efficient, that the leaving those with the states would not only be happier for them, but more beneficial for it. For whether we examine it as an abstract proposition, or avail ourselves of those lights which the history of all times hath presented to our view, yet the demonstration, at least to my mind, seems satisfactory and conclusive, that under such a government, able and willing to compel the states to perform their duty, the want of which is the great defect of the present system, and which would thereby be completely remedied that the same objects might be attained to better advantage through their intravention, than by any other mode or institution that could be adopted for the purpose. As this is perhaps the only objection which I have to the powers contained in the constitution, and is founded on principles I have already fully explained; it will be unnecessary to attempt a further illustration of it here. I shall therefore proceed, admitting the propriety of the general division into three branches, to an examination of the suborbinate organization of the government, and first of the legislature. Its division into two branches an house of representatives and senate has appeared to me to be perfectly right; and the mode prescribed for the election of the members of the former by the people not only practicable, but highly commendable. The right of originating money bills, and of impeachment, have also been properly assigned to this branch; the term of service and the principle of representation upon which its house will be formed appear likewise inexceptionable. In short this branch of the legislative is organized entirely to my wishes. I must however confess my mind has not as yet acknowledged in these respects, the same prepossessions in favour of the senate. The great defect as has been already often observed in the present form, is that of its being a diplomatic corps, a government by and for states, and not in any view of it a national one. In changing it, the object should be to correct that defect in all cases whatever, so far as it might be practicable, which can only be done by taking the appointment of all its officers out of the hands of the states, in their legislative characters, and placing it in those of the people, or electors by them appointed for the purpose. This has been done with the members of the house of representatives, but departed from with those of the Senate. This branch will therefore be in every respect the representative of the [869]states, dependent on and responsible to them for their conduct. In forming a right estimate of the consequences resulting from this property in the character of this body, and of the tone it may give to the measures of the government, we must examine its powers in every direction, and pursue its operation upon every subject. And first as to its share in the legislature or its influence upon all legislative acts. The senate has an absolute negative upon all laws; from this it results that those not for the advantage of the states, or the prevailing faction in the government, to which they respectively belong will by those thus circumstanced be rejected; for is it to be presumed that because ten members from Virginia, eight from Massachusetts or Pennsylvania in the house of representatives, have passed a bill, whilst one from Rhode Island or Delaware only had rejected it, that these states will give up their equal suffrage in the senate? Is it not more presumable that their senators will look on at the nominal and unimportant superiority of those states, in the other house, laugh at their supposed triumph, and await coolly its submission to their board, where its fate will be inevitable? Or is it to be supposed, that the right to originate money bills, a thing proper in itself, being the more democratic branch, in the house of representatives, will controul this disposition, especially when we recollect that they are both only representative branches, equally dependent on the passage of such a bill for their wages or salary, and that the members of the latter holding their offices for a shorter term, have perhaps not been able to introduce such a degree of œconomy and order into their finances. This is a check of great importance in the English constitution, and indeed the preservation of the democracy, but the construction and principles of the two governments are so radically different, that it will be easily perceived by the slightest observer, the same effects are not to be expected from it, at least not to the same extent in this, that are experienced in that. Making due allowance for those considerations that should be taken into view, I am therefore led to believe that the defective principles of the present government, through the means of the senate, in respect to form and representation, have been communicated to this branch of the constitution. Appointed by the states and of course responsible to them for their conduct, the senators will act for those to which they respectively belong; nor can we reasonably expect from their concession any great accommodation. Thus the state spirit, with an equality among the members of the union, will be preserved in this branch of the government, and if there was an absolute necessity for yielding the point of representation, yet none suggests itself, at least to me, [870]for not remedying the defect in the form, which has been found so pernicious in the present one. By the consent of two thirds of the senators present, treaties shall be formed; by that of a majority, ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, judges of the supreme court and other public officers not otherwise provided for by law, shall be appointed. The subjecting the decision of important questions to a dependance on the occasional presence or absence of any of the members, more especially as no quorum is established, appears to me improper. If the vote of two thirds of the body is in any instance necessary, for the security of the interests of any part of the union, why should the death or delinquency of a member deprive it of this safeguard, by submitting them to the controul of perhaps less than one fourth? It is further to be observed that whatever influence this branch may have in directing the measures of the executive, from the nature of its appointment, will be exerted to give it a narrow state byas, and that from this source alone, constructed as the two branches are, much injury is to be expected from this extraordinary coalition. “The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.” The president is to act under their controul in the cases above stated, if in any instance a wanton violation by their direction or permission should be made, which though not probable is yet practicable, of the rights or interests of any part of the community, and after solemn debate in the house of representatives, this high officer should be brought by impeachment before this body to expiate his offence, what would be his fate, especially as he still held his office and might wield his powers in his defence? A king of England involved himself in great difficulties by an attempt to establish the validity of a general pardon, but had the constitution submitted the trial of state offenders to himself, there would have been no occasion for the contest.7 Admitting however the members of this body to be incapable of moral turpitude, may we not suppose, as might be the case in that of any individual state; in the operation of this government, that offences might be committed against one quarter of the community, and which before a dispassionate court would receive severe reprehension, that would be highly beneficial to the others? And in such a case could we expect from the representatives of these states a candid or impartial decision against the interests of their constituents? The placing the executive power in the hands of one person, appears to be perfectly right. If this branch had been put into commission, the state spirit would have been communicated to it, and have tainted all its measures; in addition to this there would have been less responsibility. [871]But the mode of election, does not in all respects appear, to merit such commendation. A departure from the strict representative line, by adding the equal vote of the senate to the number each state hath in the house of representatives, is made in the first instance; but it is still more exceptionable in other respects. If an election shall not be made, and in all probability this will often be the case, indeed the presumption is the contrary will seldom happen, a very extraordinary subsidiary mode is resorted to. Those having the five highest votes are to be ballotted for by the house of representatives, the vote to be taken by states, and one member from each giving the vote of the state. All cases that the constitution will admit of, should be considered as likely to happen some time or other. No person then I am persuaded who will make the calculation, can behold the facility by which the chair of the United States may be approached and atchieved, even contrary to the wishes of the people, without equal anxiety and surprize.(d) Let it be admitted that the temper of the times and the ardent spirit of liberty which now prevails, will guard it for the present from such easy access; but that person has profited but little, from the faithful admonition which ail history has given him, who shall conclude from thence, that this will always be the case. His right to remain in office after impeachment, with the influence though diminished, still attending it, appears to be highly improper. That of adjournment in case of impeachment, ⟨disagreement⟩ between the two branches, to such time as he shall think fit, is certainly too unqualified and extensive. The impropriety of the union of this branch with the senate has already been sufficiently dilated on; it will therefore be unnecessary to repeat the same arguments here. Contemplating however the consequences of this union, the expiration of his service, should in my opinion be accompanied with a temporary disqualification. The senators, would to save the commonwealth from injury, be able to give instruction to a new president, and it would perhaps be better, to change occasionally the acting party, of a combination that might otherwise be dangerous. From the first clause respecting the judiciary it is obvious, that the Congress, although there shall be one Supreme Court only, may establish as many subordinate to it, as they shall think fit. The presumption is, they will establish so many as shall be necessary for the discharge of the functions of the department, to the advantage of the government, and benefit of the people. The extent therefore of the duties which become the exclusive object of a federal court, may give some insight into that establishment they might probably adopt; and when we observe that the cognizance of all cases arising under the [872]constitution and the laws, either of a civil or criminal nature, in law or equity, with those other objects which it specifies, even between the citizens of the same state, are taken from those of each state and absolutely appropriated to the courts of the United States, we are led into a view of the very important interests it comprehends, and of the extensive scale upon which it operates. It will therefore be the duty of Congress to organize this branch, by the establishment of such subordinate courts, throughout the whole confederacy, in such manner as shall be found necessary to support the authority of the government, and carry justice home, so far as it may be practicable, to the doors of all its inhabitants. What mode may be best calculated to accomplish this end, belongs to that body to determine. Bound by no rule they may it is true (as in the commencement they probably would) avail themselves of those of each state; but this would be a measure of expedience only and not of right, and may hereafter be changed as the fortunes of the government, and considerations of expedience may dictate. How far it might be proper to authorise the subjects of foreign powers to carry the citizens of any state into a federal court, and afterwards by appeal into the Supreme Court, is of questionable propriety. The principal argument in its favour appears to be that of securing the United States from the danger of controversies with such powers, under the partial decisions of those of the individual states. But if they knew such cases, were by a fundamental of our government submitted to them, it were reasonable to suppose, that all just cause of complaint, would be removed. The submission to a federal court of contests upon ordinary subjects, between citizens of the same state, or even of different states, or indeed upon any subject, that did not arise under territorial controversies between states, and which originally belonged to that court, appears to be highly improper and altogether unnecessary. The appeal as to fact is still more extraordinary and exceptionable. The verdict which has been found must of course be set aside, and the court subjected to the necessity of either trying the cause upon the evidence already given, with liberty to construe it at pleasure; of hearing it over again admitting other evidence, being judges of the fact themselves; or submitting it to another jury to find a second verdict, either of which modes appears to be highly exceptionable; for if the court become judges of fact under the old or a new trial, the right of trial by jury is dispensed with; and if a second jury shall be summoned, independent of the difficulty and hardship, attending the submission of controversies contracted at the extremities of the union, by people in some degree variant in their manners, customs, and prejudices, to a jury formed of those of any one town, [873]the parties are necessarily exposed to the loss of time, (of importance especially to the lower classes of society) and the enormous expence inseparable from a tryal carried on at a great distance from home. What necessity there can be, so effectually to lay aside the state courts, (which though perhaps improperly organized at present are yet capable of improvement) and subject the good people of America to such new and unheard of difficulties, I must confess I am not able to comprehend, nor can I readily forsee the very important consequences into which it may lead. Having now taken a view as concisely as I have been able, of the defects of the present system, suggested their remedy with the principles upon which it is founded, examined the constitution by that standard, and shewn wherein I have either approved or disapproved of it; perhaps it may be expected (as a deduction from the foregoing principles) that I should make some calculation, of the probable course and ultimate fate of the government, should it be adopted in its present form, since it might have some influence upon your opinion in the present instance. This must however be altogether conjectural, for in the operation of government, as in that of all other powers after consequences, have been clearly demonstrated, as resulting from certain causes, oftentimes some incident, not contemplated, nor taken into the combination, or extra circumstance arises, that gives it a different direction. To form any estimate in this respect some peculiarities present themselves to view very deserving of attention. The mixture between the general and state governments, being partly a consolidated and partly a confederated one, suggests a balance between sovereignties that is new and interesting. So far as it proceeds from the people and its powers embrace the care of their interests, it partakes of the qualities of the former; and so far as the state governments remain of the latter. In weighing the momentum of their relative strength or force it is no less difficult to determine which will preponderate. Founded alike by the people, by the people also may either be changed at pleasure. If the precise boundary had been drawn between them, the proper checks established, and the general government well poised, ⟨it⟩ might for a long time, and I should hope forever, be stationary; defective in these respects it will probably soon experience a change. Pursuing a natural course under those shocks it must expect, without any foreign impression to give it the fairest hopes, let us enquire what the interests of the people will dictate, for let that be its direction. Independent state sovereignties, or partial confederacies, have been reprobated in its commencement. Its foundation has been laid on the ruin of all schemes that had that tendency, and it is presumeable it [874]would in no event embrace either, at least until it had experienced a great vicissitude of fortunes. If then it escaped the first paroxisms, the severe struggles, and violent efforts against it, exposed it to, its establishment might be considered as complete. And suppressing the spirit of opposition, its constitutional basis will be found broad and extensive. It is not the aid of the Delphic oracle, the blind zeal of enthusiasim, that will be called in to its support. It has the protection of the true religion, of divine authority itself, to shield it from danger. The exercise of powers in common that will be allowed of in its commencement, must yield on the part of the states, to its acquiring strength. And wielding those the constitution has given it without availing itself of such as were constructive, the state governments, under this progress, would soon become a burthen to the people. The confederated principle, or the spirit of state sovereignty, would however not be inactive, but operate so as to bring on the crisis; and the constitution itself presents a fruitful source of controversy, for the spirit of accommodation, or the mutual fear of danger, must be great, where the line between them is not exactly drawn, if they do not interfere. If this government had been organized over one state, with a moderate extent of territory, its natural progress, through the Senate, would be to aristocracy. But as it is I am inclined to believe, that although in its operation it may bear that tone, yet when it becomes convulsed and experiences a change, it will hold a different direction. Even the construction of that branch in its operation will contribute to hurry it into monarchy,8 and our earnest hopes and prayers should be, every circumstance considered, that it be a limitted one. For these reasons and not that I fear any danger to the liberties of our country, from the effective force of the government, exerted immediately against the good people of America, could I wish those checks and guards adopted, omitted at present from neglect and an over confidence of our security, but which it is possible if the present opportunity is lost, we may contend for hereafter in vain. Political institutions, we are taught by melancholy experience, have their commencement, maturity and decline; and why should we not in early life, take those precautions that are calculated to prolong our days, and guard against the diseases of age? Or shall we rather follow the example of the strong, active, and confident young man, who in the pride of health, regardless of the admonition of his friends, pursues the gratification of unbridled appetites, and falls a victim to his own indiscretion, even in the morn of life, and before his race had been fairly begun. I have to apologize for the trouble I have given you in the perusal of the observations. I owe it to myself however to observe that the [875]bounds within which I have been under the necessity of confining this letter has prevented my going into that detail, often necessary, especially on so int⟨r⟩icate a subject for the sake of illustration; and the want of leisure has I fear, prevented even a tolerable degree of correctness. But if I have been able to explain myself to your satisfaction I shall be contented. Upon the whole it results that although I am for a change, and a radical one, of the confederation, yet I have some strong and invincible objections to that proposed to be substituted in its stead. Those of less weight might be yielded for the sake of accomodation; but until an experiment shall prove the contrary, I shall always believe that the exercise of direct taxation and excise, by one body, over the very extensive territory contained within the bounds of the United States, will terminate either in anarchy and a dissolution of the government, or a subversion of liberty. The judiciary I consider as illy organized and its powers as too extensive, the whole government in a great measure without responsibility, and the rights of men too loosely guarded. And when I behold the Senate, a corps more deplomatic in its principle, permanent in its station, and systematic in its operations, than even the late Congress itself, wielding in the one hand the strong powers of the Executive, and with the other controuling and modifying at pleasure, the movements of the legislature, I must confess that not only my hopes of the beneficial effects of the government, are greatly diminished, but that my apprehensions of some fatal catastrophe are highly awakened. We have struggled long to bring about this revolution, we have fought and bled freely to accomplish it, and in other respects braved difficulties almost without a parellel. Why then this precipitation, why this hurry upon a subject so momentous, and equally interesting to us all? Is it to be supposed that unless we immediately adopt this plan, in its fullest extent, we shall forever loose the opportunity of forming for ourselves a good government? That some wild phrensy or delirium of the brain will seize upon us, and losing all recollection of things past, and abandoning the social ties that bind mankind together, we shall fall into some strange and irritrievable disorder? Or is it not more natural to suppose that perfection in any science, if attainable at all, is to be approached by slow and gradual advances, and that the plan of government now presented for your inspection, though a powerful effort of the human mind, is yet to be improved by a second essay? The subject now submitted to you, is no less interesting than it is important. Providence hath long seen nine-tenths of the habitable globe immersed, and groaning under the dreadful oppressions of slavery. To the people of America, to you it belongs to correct the opposite [876]extremes. To form a government that shall shield you from dangers from abroad, promote your general and local interests, protect in safety the life, liberty, and property, of the peaceful, the virtuous and the weak, against the encroachments of the disorderly and licentious. Whether they are now endangered, whether the plan now before you, presented under the most faithful and illustrious auspices; under the auspices of men of whose abilities and integrity you have long had the most satisfactory proofs, and who to the most important services, by abandoning the enjoyments of a peaceful and happy retirement, have added this further testimony, of their never failing attachments to the interests of their country, will accomplish this end, or is capable of still further improvement, belongs to you to determine. To differ in any respect from these men, is no pleasant thing to me; but being called upon an awful stage upon which I must now bear a part, I have thought it my duty to explain to you the principles on which my opinions were founded, under this further assurance, that if after a candid review, they shall appear indefensible, I will most chearfully submit to be governed by your wishes, and obey other instructions. (a)Polybius, vol. 3, page 92 (b)As in the restoration of Charles II. in England. (c)De Lolme.

Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Edmund Pendleton,,,5/26/1788,"The manner in which we have together struggled for the just rights of human nature, with the friendly correspondence that we have maintained, entitles us, I hope, to the most unreserved confidence in each other upon the subject of human rights and the liberty of our country. ⟨It is probable that yourself, no more than I do, propose to be hereafter politically engaged; neither therefore expecting to gain or fearing to loose, the candid part of mankind will admit us to be impartial Judges, at least of the arduous business that calls you to Richmond on the 2d. of next month.⟩2 I do not recollect to have met with a sensible and candid Man who has not admitted that it would be both safer and better if amendments were made to the Constitution proposed for the government of the U. States; but the friends to the idea of amendments divide about the mode of obtaining them—Some thinking that a second Convention might do the business, whilst others fear that the attempt to remedy by another Convention would risk the whole. I have been informed that you wished Amendments, but disliked the plan of another Convention. The just weight that you have Sir in the Councils of your Country may put it in your power to save from Arbitrary Rule a great and free people. I have used the words Arbitrary Rule because great numbers fear that this will be the case, when they consider that it may be so under the new proposed System, and reflect on the unvarying progress of power in the hands of frail Man. To accomplish the ends of Society by being equal to Contingencies infinite, demands the deposit of power great and extensive indeed in the hands of Rulers. So great, as to render abuse probable, unless prevented by the most careful precautions: among which, the freedom & frequency of elections, the liberty of the Press, the Trial by Jury, and the Independency of the Judges, seem to be so capital & essential; that they ought to be [879]secured by a Bill of Rights to regulate the discretion of Rulers in a legal way, restraining the progress of Ambition & Avarice within just bounds. Rulers must act by subordinate Agents generally, and however the former may be secure from the pursuits of Justice, the latter are forever kept in Check by the trial by Jury where that exists “in all its Rights”. This most excellent security against oppression, is an universal, powerful and equal protector of all. But the benefit to be derived from this System is most effectually to be obtained from a well informed and enlightened people. Here arrises the necessity for the freedom of the Press, which is the happiest Organ of communication ever yet devised, the quickest & surest means of conveying intelligence to the human Mind. I am grieved to be forced to think, after the most mature consideration of the subject, that the proposed Constitution leaves the three essential Securities before stated, under the mere pleasure of the new Rulers! And why should it be so Sir, since the violation of these cannot be necessary to good government, but will be always extremely convenient for bad. It is a question deserving intense consideration, whether the State Sovereignties ought not to be supported, perhaps in the way proposed by Massachusetts in their 1st. 3d. & 4th Amendments.3 Force & Opinion seem to be the two ways alone by which Men can be governed—the latter appears the most proper for a free people—but remove that and obedience, I apprehend, can only be found to result from fear the Offspring of force. If this be so, can Opinion exist ⟨among the great Mass of Mankind⟩ without compitent knowledge of those who govern, and can that knowledge take place in a Country so extensive as the territory of the U. States which is stated by Capt. Hutchins4 at a Million of square miles, whilst the empire of Germany contains but 192,000, and the kingdom of France but 163,000 square miles. The almost infinite variety of climates, Soils, productions, manners, customs & interests renders this still more difficult for the general government of one Legislature; but very practicable to Confederated States united for mutual safety & happiness, each contributing to the federal head such a portion of its sovereignty as would render the government fully adequate to these purposes and No more. The people would govern themselves more easily, the laws of each State being well adapted to its own genius and circumstances; the liberties of the U. States would probably be more secure than under the proposed plan, which, carefully attended to will be found capable of annihilating the State Sovereignties by finishing the operations of their State governments under the general Legislative right of commanding Taxes without restraint. So that the productive Revenues that the States may [880]happily fall upon for their own support can be seized by superior power supported by the Congressional Courts of Justice, and by the sacred obligation of Oath imposed on all the State Judges to regard the laws of Congress as sup[reme?] over the laws and Constitutions of the States! Thus circumst[anced we?] shall probably find resistance vain, and the State governments as feeble and contemptible as was the Senatorial power under the Roman Emperors—The name existed but the thing was gone. I have observed Sir that the sensible and candid friends of the proposed plan agree that amendments would be proper, but fear the consequences of another Convention. I submit the following as an effectual compromise between the Majorities, and the formidable Minorities that generally prevail. It seems probable that the determinations of four States5 will be materially influenced by what Virginia shall do—This places a strong obligation on our country to be unusually cautious and circumspect in our Conventional conduct. The Mode that I would propose is something like that pursued by the Convention Parliament of England in 1688.6 In our Ratification insert plainly and strongly such amendments as can be agreed upon, and say; that the people of Virginia do insist upon and mean to retain them as their undoubted rights and liberties which they intend not to part with; and if these are not obtained and secured by the Mode pointed out in the 5th. article of the Convention plan in two years after the meeting of the new Congress, that Virginia shall be considered as disengaged from this Ratification. In the 5th. article it is stated that two thirds of Congress may propose amendments, which being approved by three fourths of the Legislatures become parts of the Constitution—So that the new Congress may obtain the amendments of Virginia without risking the convulsion of Conventions. Thus the beneficial parts of the new System may be retained, and a just security be given for Civil Liberty; whilst the friends of the System will be gratified in what they say is necessary, to wit, the putting the government in motion, when, as they again say, amendments may and ought to be made. The good consequences resulting from this method will probably be, that the undetermined States may be brought to harmonize, and the formidable minorities in many assenting States be quieted by so friendly and reasonable an accommodation. In this way may be happily prevented the perpetual opposition that will inevitably follow (the total adoption of the plan) from the State Legislatures; and united exertions take place. In the formation of these amendments Localities ought to be avoided as much as possible. The danger of Monopolized Trade may be avoided by calling for the consent of 3 fourths of the U. States on regulations of Commerce. The [881]trial by Jury to be according to the course of proceeding in the State where the cause criminal or civil is tried, and confining the Supreme federal Court to the jurisdiction of Law excluding Fact. To prevent surprises, and the fixing of injurious laws, it would seem to be prudent to declare against the making [perpetual?] laws until the experience of two years at least shall have [vouched?] their utility. It being much more easy to get a good Law [continued?] than a bad one repealed. The amendments of Massachusetts [appear?] to be good so far as they go, except the 2d. and extending the 7th. [to?] foreigners as well as the Citizens of other States in this Union.7 For th[eir?] adoption the aid of that powerful State may be secured. The freedom of the Press is by no means sufficiently attended to by Massachusetts, nor have they remedied the want of responsibility by the impolitic combination of President & Senate. ⟨No person, I think, can be alarmed at that part of the above proposition which proposes our discharge if the requisite Amendments are not made; because, in all human probability it will be the certain means of securing their adoption for the following reasons—N.C. N.Y. R.I. & N.H. are the 4 States that are to determine after Virginia, and there being abundant reason to suppose that they will be much influenced by our determination; if they, or 3 of them join us, I presume it cannot be fairly imagined that the rest, suppose 9, will hesitate a moment to make Amendments which are of general nature, clearly for the safety of Civil Liberty against the future designs of despotism to destroy it; and which indeed is requir’d by at least half of most of those States who have adopted the new Plan; and which finally obstruct not good but bad government.⟩ It does appear to me, that in the present temper of America, if the Massachusetts amendments, with those herein suggested being added, & were inserted in the form of our ratification as before stated, that Virginia may safely agree, and I believe that the most salutary consequences would ensue. ⟨I am sure that America and the World too look with anxious expectations at us, if we change the Liberty that we have so well deserved for elective Despotism we shall suffer the evils of the change while we labor under the contempt of Mankind⟩—I pray Sir that God may bless the Convention with wisdom, maturity of Counsel, and constant care of the public liberty; and that he may have you in his holy keeping. ⟨I find that as usual, I have written to you a long letter—but you are good and the subject is copious—I like to reason with a reasonable Man, but I disdain to notice those Scribblers in the Newspapers altho they have honored me with their abuse—My attention to them will never exist whilst there is a Cat or a Spaniel in the House!⟩"
Letter,Yes,George Mason,Thomas Jefferson,,,5/26/1788,"… I make no Doubt that You have long ago received Copys of the new Constitution of Government, framed last Summer, by the Delegates of the several States, in general Convention at Philadelphia.—Upon the most mature Consideration I was capable of, and from Motives of sincere Patriotism, I was under the Necessity of refusing my Signature, as one of the Virginia Delegates; and drew up some general Objections; which I intended to offer, by Way of Protest; but was discouraged from doing so, by the precipitate, & intemperate, not to say indecent Manner, in which the Business was conducted, during the last week of the Convention, after the Patrons of this new plan found they had a decided Majority in their Favour;2 which was obtained by [883]a Compromise between the Eastern, & the two Southern States, to permit the latter to continue the Importation of Slaves for twenty odd Years; a more favourite Object with them, than the Liberty and Happiness of the People.3— These Objections of mine were first printed very incorrectly, without my Approbation, or Privity; which laid me under some kind of Necessity of publishing them afterwards, myself.—I take the Liberty of enclosing You a Copy of them.4 You will find them conceived in general Terms; as I wished to confine them to a narrow compass.—There are many other things very objectionable in the proposed new Constitution; particularly the almost unlimited Authority over the Militia of the several States; whereby, under Colour of regulating, they may disarm, or render useless the Militia, the more easily to govern by a standing Army; or they may harrass the Militia, by such rigid Regulations, and intolerable Burdens, as to make the People themselves desire it’s Abolition.—By their Power over the Elections, they may so order them, as to deprive the People at large of any Share in the Choice of their Representatives.—By the Consent of Congress, Men in the highest Offices of Trust in the United States may receive any Emolument, Place, or Pension from a forreign Prince, or Potentate; which is setting themselves up to the highest Bidder.—But it would be tedious to enumerate all the Objections; and I am sure they cannot escape Mr. Jefferson’s Observation.—Delaware—Pensylvania—Jersey—Connecticut—Georgia, and Maryland have ratifyed the new Government (for surely it is not a Confederation) without Amendments—Massachusets has accompanyed the Ratification with proposed Amendments—Rhode Island has rejected it—New Hampshire, after some Deliberation, adjourned their Convention to June—The Convention of South Carolina is now sitting—The Convention of new York meets in June—that of North Carolina in July—and the Convention of Virginia meets on the first Monday in June. I shall set out for Richmond this week, in order to attend it.—From the best Information I have had, the Members of the Virginia Convention are so equally divided upon the Subject, that no Man can, at present, form any certain Judgement of the Issue. There seems to be a great Majority for Amendments; but many are for ratifying first, and amending afterwards. This Idea appears to me so utterly absurd, that I can not think any Man of Sense candid, in Proposing it.…"
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,5/28/1788,"I have in a former paper endeavored to take a view of the leading principles of the new federal constitution.1 In pursuing the design of that address it was necessary to make some previous remarks on the nature of civil government in general: This led me to premise the material discrimination between arbitrary constitutions and the constitution of free governments. The arbitrary species, or those, which fix no other limits to the [886]supreme rulers, but their own wills, are totally incompatible with the spirit of civil liberty, and exclude every idea of free government. These may be described by the harsher epithet of despotism. Some men may perhaps fancy a distinction where in reality none exists. They may conceive the possibility of a government being constituted, which may with great propriety be denominated arbitrary; and yet consider it not as despotic. If, however, it be recollected that the term despotism is a relative expression arising from the authority of masters over their servants, which authority is founded in the will of the masters, it must plainly appear that every degree of arbitrary power is despotic; and that tyranny in government, whether it be distinguished by the former, or by the latter, appellation, is its regular and natural production. For whenever a power becomes vested in any agent, as unrestrained as the will of that agent, in him are immediately created the properties of a master; and those, over whom he exercises such power, stand ipso facto in the relation of servants. To some the bare mention of despotic rule conveys the most alarming ideas of horror; yet at the same time are they satisfied with the gentler operations, as they imagine, of some species of arbitrary sway. With [– – –] of zeal they urge the expediency of a plan, which has for its basis the extended sphere of human will. They contend that it is necessary to establish a system, so unrestrained in its nature, in order to effectuate a strong and energetic government. This desirable object they seem to consider as unattainable by any other means;—and that all institutions, which convey only a limited authority, are inadequate to the purposes of society. Such a kind of responsibility, as would form a check on the supreme rulers, is deemed a source of continual impediment; and—to secure any degree of natural liberty, however small a residuum, is, in contemplation of their minds, laying the foundation of a weak government, liable to endless confusions, and productive of nothing better than sedition and anarchy. They conceive a fondness for this species of government, because it is framed in the republican stile; and, although fraught with the seeds of despotism, the apparent loveliness of its outward garb hides all the deformity of its inward corruptions. Whence it is manifest that distinctions are formed, which are preposterous and merely imaginary. Nothing, perhaps, has contributed more towards interrupting the repose of mankind than a curious attention to the names and shadows of things, whilst the real essence and substantial parts have been disregarded. That, which in any particular form has once produced much evil [887]and discontent, generally stamps a lasting impression on the mind, and is not contemplated but with extreme detestation; although evils of the same nature, when inflicted under a different appearance, are frequently submitted to without repining. Thus, after the expulsion of Tarquin, and with him the extinction of regal authority in Rome, the name of King was ever odi[o]us to the Roman people; yet did they acquiesce in the exercise of arbitrary transactions under a different form of government. Such were they frequently subjected to through the various stages of their republic; until at last the sovereign power was established in the person of a single man. This change produced a system of government, unbounded as the regal sway, and no less susceptible of tyrannical proceedings. They could then respect the name of emperor, unlimited as he was, and, though exposed to all the rage of oppression, bow down with reverence, and venerate the imperial scepter. The insidious attempts under a British administration to pervert the former government into a baneful system of tyranny had spread a general alarm throughout America. Opposition to arbitrary measures manifested itself among all ranks of people. Diligent enquiries were made to [expose?] the schemes of their enemies; jealousies excited to an unusual degree with respect to their rights and privileges;—whilst exertions were made, which produced the most desirable effects. All these circumstances conspired in exhibiting very favorable prospects, and promised a lasting security to American liberty. The injuries suffered under a government, which exposed the people of these states to the machinations of wicked and designing ministers, determined them in the choice of a system, which had principally in view the preservation of their liberty. Such was its grand object. In pursuit of this plan, as the great means of national happiness, constitutions were formed for the different states upon principles, salutary in their nature, and tending to perpetuate the freedom and independency of each. To these was added a confederation, under which the separate republics so constituted might harmonize in all their general interests. Thus were they situated—when a defect was apprehended in this confederation. The ineffectual endeavors to promote some important advantages, and to answer all the exigenc[i]es of the union, indicated a weakness in the general government. A revision was deemed expedient. When, therefore, a new constitution was proposed, it became the duty of every American diligently to enquire, first, whether this system was coincident with their standing maxims of liberty; and, if so—whether conducive to good policy. If found derogatory to the former—any [888]consideration respecting the latter should be unnecessary. This alone should mark it, as dangerous, and unworthy of approbation. The genius of America [– – –] [– – –] [– – –] [– – –] that no fancied schemes of policy should compensate for the adoption of a plan discordant to her favorite principles of liberty. This is not a chimerical illusion, but a solid and interesting consideration. A mind thus convicted must act inconsistent with propriety, and contrary to every sentiment of duty, if it would then approve of the plan. The writer of this address had, therefore, in his first number chiefly intended to take up this matter only so far as related to its principles—and having conceived that these were incompatible with the admired maxims of American liberty, his objections on that head were there laid down. Observing, however, that most of the writers in favor of the plan seem in a great measure to have passed over this important point—and recommend it merely from motives of policy; it is now intended, as the business of some succeeding papers,2 to state objections to such of the constituent parts of the plan, abstracted of its principles, as appear, in his opinion, improperly constructed, and calculated to produce ill effects in their operation. These writers seem not to regard any fundamentals in government, provided they can procure a plan, in which they fancy some prospects of immediate benefit are to be discovered. In conformity with the stile of the proposed constitution, the favorers of it have, with a peculiarity of self-applause, ascribed to themselves the distinction of federalists; while those, who oppose the plan are marked with the epithet of anti-federal. The strong desire, which has been manifested, for a union between the American states, since the revolution, affords an opportunity of making the distinction, as they imagine, to their advantage.—As federalists, in their opinion, they must be deemed friendly to the union:—as anti-federal, the opposers must, in their opinion too, be considered unfriendly. Thus on the sound of names they build their fame. For those gentlemen, however, let it be observed that the opponents seem to act on the broader scale of true federal principles. The advocates for the new code wish all sovereignty to be lodged in the hands of Congress. This is not to connect thirteen independent states—but to form one extended empire by compounding the whole, and thus destroying the sovereignty of each. The other party desire a continuance of each distinct sovereignty—and are anxious for such a degree of energy in the general government, as will cement the union in the [889]strongest manner. This they consider as one of the greatest blessings, which can attend their country."

Letter,Yes,William Short,Thomas Lee Shippen,,,5/31/1788,"Since your departure we have had no news of any steps taken towards the acceptance of the constitution—we as yet only know of six states—by the last packet we have gained no additional information except as to the dispositions of So. Carolina, Maryland & Virginia—in the two former it must be now decided—in the latter it is beginning to be in deliberation. It is said there will be no opposition in So. Carolina—in Maryland there is a very great majority in some districts against the constitution, but much the greater number of districts seem to be for it—so that on the whole there is little doubt of its being accepted by that State, so far as we may judge from newspapers & the public opinion at the time of the sailing of the Packet.—In Virginia it will be one of the most nicely divided questions that ever came on—in that State there are three parties, federalists, tho[s]e who desire the constitution but with amendments, antifederalists.

Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/4/1788,"Besides those inherent rights, which should be established as fundamental principles, independent of the constitution, there are certain other maxims essential to every free government. These should pervade the whole plan. They should be interwoven with its very texture. And, as it is necessary that the first should be preserved sacred and inviolate; so ought the last to be regarded as indispensible. These should be the leading properties, the head—the soul of the system; whilst those exist entire, supreme and uncontrouled. It will not be denied, that all power is originally vested in the people, and that it should be exercised either immediately by themselves, or mediately by their representatives. These are maxims, without the observance of which the liberty of every nation must expire. When the power is exercised by their representatives, it is expedient that the representation be whole and complete. It should be ample, that amongst the members there may be a competent knowledge of the constituents, their sentiments, connections, views and habits; and that amongst the constituents there may generally be a due degree of knowledge respecting the virtues and abilities of the members. In extensive territories, where the people are widely dispersed, and individuals can have very little communication beyond the circle of their own neighbourhood, the representation should also be extensive. In countries thus situated, unless the legislature be numerous, there cannot be expected amongst the members thereof a general knowledge of their constituents: and when the member to be elected bears a very small proportion to the number of electors, it is utterly improbable that the majority should have an adequate knowledge of those, who will be elected. So that a great part of the community must in a manner be obliged to submit their most important concerns into the hands of a few persons unknown to themselves, and of whose wisdom, integrity and patriotism they can form no competent judgment. Again, the representation should be complete, that is, it should be such as to comprehend every species of interest within the society. All orders of men, who have any permanent interest in the government, as far as practicable, ought to be represented. Regarding, then, the great diversity, which pervades most communities, from the highest funded concerns through the various stages of mercantile and mechanic interests, we must discover the necessity of an extensive delegation. When, therefore, the number of representatives in a legislature is very small, this affords objections, not only because they are not [1577]numerous enough to contain a competent knowledge of their constituents: they are inadequate to, and cannot sufficiently respect, all the complicated, variant and opposite interests, which must necessarily subsist in a commonwealth, whose inhabitants are spread over a wide-extended country. The smallness of their number enhances the dignity of their seats; and none can expect to obtain a seat, except men of the most elevated station. Thus in the beginning of a government so constituted there will be laid a foundation for the exercise of undue influence, whereby every branch of supreme power will be in a manner monopolized by one set of men: and thus the delegation will become partial. For, besides the effect of this undue influence in elections, the dispersed situation of the electors, together with that of the candidates, will ever produce much division amongst the suffrages;—and so the select party, who will be distinguished by their superior wealth, being the leading junto in this business, will easily procure a competent number to decide for themselves or their favorites. Thus it will generally happen, that elections will be determined, not by the majority of the people, but perhaps by an inconsiderable part of them; and the persons chosen will be such, whose situation and rank in life had removed them far from a knowledge of the great body of the people. They will consequently be unacquainted with the customs, feelings, opinions and wishes of most of their constituents; and as the constituents will be unacquainted with their representatives,—these will not possess the confidence of those. Doubt and distrust will prevail.—That course of congenial sentiment—that reciprocity of common interest between legislature and bulk of the nation, which should be the soul of republicanism, and are the chief objects of a free, unbiassed and general representation, will not exist in this kind of government. How, then, can it be expected that a strict regard to the good of all will mark the public proceedings? Who can really imagine that a body, thus constituted and thus invested with sovereign authority, will regularly devote their labors to promote the happiness, prosperity and freedom of a community, over whom they bear the rule—when they view themselves advanced to this state of exaltation—when this high degree of dignity will tempt them to look down with indifference, perhaps contempt, on the inhabitants of a spacious territory, as the subjects of their government—and when they contemplate these, as generally unconnected with themselves in all their most important concerns?—The uniform experience of ages operates against the idea. It may be dangerous to indulge in such a scheme of policy—lest its fairest prospects should prove visionary indeed!—lest in its exercise the directly contrary effects should be produced. For the foregoing reasons, the legislative powers proposed to be granted according to the new system appear liable to material objections. For herein the number of representatives being too small to encourage the idea of a full or complete deputation, there is no prospect of securing a due regard to all the different interests necessarily arising amongst the numerous inhabitants of America, spread over a territory so extensive—so vast—so various in climate, products, habits and connections. That part of the legislature, which is particularly denominated the house of representatives, is indeed the only popular branch; and although these officers are to be chosen by the immediate suffrages of the people, yet their dignity, being necessarily great in proportion as their number is small, fair and unbiassed elections are scarcely probable, if not impracticable. In the appointment and constitution of the other branch, the senate, we have but the shade of a deputation from the people. The state-legislatures, it seems, are to elect this body. The objections, which apply to the house of representatives, hold more strongly with regard to this, in as much as longer continuance in office will be productive of more danger; and the mode of appointment, by rendering them more independent of the people, will preclude these from having any decisive influence on their conduct. It is no argument in favor of the manner proposed, that it is the same, by which the members of the present Congress are chosen. The nature and end of the one being totally different from those of the other, if they be duly considered, it may, perhaps, be thought not inexpedient to vary the proceedings respecting them. The Congress under the present confederation are the deputies of sovereign states in the full exercise of independent government. These deputies are appointed by the legislatures thereof, not for the purpose of regulating the internal police of the states, but to superintend their general and foreign affairs so far as all the states are concerned in common. When, therefore, the legislature of any state is actually existing and in the exercise of their office, it seems not improper that such deputies should be appointed by them: for in strictness they appear to be the deputies of the legislature; and are to them immediately amenable. The proposed senate are to exercise a share of legislation in the general government, and to participate in the sovereignty of America. Thus circumstanced, they will know not any authority superior to that, whereof they themselves possess a part. They are intended, as such, to be a branch of the representation of the people. To the people they ought to be amenable: and by the people they ought to be chosen."
Letter,No,New York Federal Republican Committee,,,,6/6/1788,"We addressed you on the ______ since which a return has been made of our Elections for Delegates to the convention—It appears from ye returns that there is a majority of at least two to one who are against adopting the Constitution in its present form— We give you this information, to induce you to take measures to bring about a communication between your Convention and ours on the subject of amendments—There cannot be a doubt but that the necessary alterations can be effected, and all the apprehensions of danger from the new government removed, if your State and ours could unite in sentiments respecting the amendments, and act in concert in measures to bring them about—We have reason to believe that [816]New Hampshire will concur with us—An event of this kind would we are persuaded produce the most happy consequences and procure essential benefits to our common Country. As by this means the obnoxious & exceptionable articles in the new system would be so changed, as to create confidence in the minds of a great number of worthy Citizens, who now regard the government, as a dangerous scheme, calculated to destroy their Liberties—Under these impressions, we earnestly wish, that such of the States as have yet to deliberate on the subject, might confer on the matter, and unite in some rational plan, to procure amendments such as would preserve the strictest union with and affection between sister States— We may venture to assure you that our State will join in such measures with ye greatest cordiality. If you should be in sentiment with us we beg leave to suggest to you the propriety of writing to North Carolina, inviting them to unite with us.7"

You will be pleased to consider this in the light of a private letter; at all events so far, as to prevent my being quoted in the public newspaper.—I will do myself the pleasure of giving you the earliest notice of the final decision of this Assembly; should we be strong enough to command the question, I think it will be highly expedient for the [817]Convention to open a correspondence with yours: this however is my sentimts. not knowing how others will think on the occasion."
Letter,No,Patrick Henry,John Lamb,,,6/9/1788,"I was honord by the Rect. of your Favor by the Hands of Colo.

Letter,No,George Mason,John Lamb,,,6/9/1788,"I have had the Honor to receive your Letter dated the 18th. of May, in behalf of the federal republican Committee of New York, upon the Subject of the Government proposed by the late Convention to the respective States for their Adoption; and have communicated it to several respectable Gentlemen of the Convention now met in this City, who are opposed to the Adoption without previous Amendments: They receive, with pleasure, the proposition of your Committee for a free Correspondence on the Subject of Amendments, and have requested me to transmit to your committee such as we have agreed on as necessary for previous Adoption. Although there is a general Concurrence in the Convention of this State that Amendments are necessary, yet, the Members are so equally divided with respect to the Time and Manner of obtaining them, that it cannot now be ascertained whether the Majority will be on our Side or not; if it should be so, I have no doubt but that an official Communication will immediately take place between the Conventions of this State and yours. As the Amendments proposed by the Convention of Massachusets are the first which have been offered to the public,18 and contain in them many things that are necessary, it is deemed proper to make them the Basis of such as may finally be agreed on; and it may also be proper to observe, that an executive Council will be necessary; because Power and Responsibility are two things essential to a good Executive; the first of which cannot be safely given, nor the latter insured, where the Legislative Senate form a part of the Executive. The Judiciary, the exclusive Legislative Power over the ten Miles square, and the Militia, are Subjects to which our Attention will next be turned, and we shall communicate the Result of our Deliberations with all possible Dispatch. The Nature of the Opposition here is such that it has not yet taken any particular form, being composed only of Members of the Convention who meet to prepare such Amendments as they deem necessary to be offered to the Convention: If it should hereafter become necessary to assume one, it is hoped that System and Order will every where appear suitable to the Importance and Dignity of the Cause. In the mean Time, it is recommended to us, to communicate with you under cover to Capt. Jacob Reed jr. of Queen-Street, New York,19 in Order to prevent any Interruption that Curiosity might give. We approve of the Precaution; and also advise that Mr. George Fleming [819]Mercht. of this City be made the Instrument of safe Conveyance on your part. [Enclosure]20 Amendments to the New Constitution of Government. That there be a Declaration or Bill of Rights, asserting and securing from Encroachment, the Essential and unalienable Rights of the People, in some such Manner as the following.— 1. That all Freemen have certain essential inherent Rights, of which they cannot by any Compact, deprive or divest their Posterity; among which are the Enjoyment of Life and Liberty, with the means of acquiring, possessing and protecting Property, and pursuing and obtaining Happiness and Safety. 2. That all Power is naturally vested in, and consequently derived from the People; that Magistrates therefore are their Trustees and Agents, and at all Times amenable to them. 3. That Government ought to be instituted for the Common Benefit, Protection and Security of the People; and that whenever any Government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a Majority of the Community hath an indubitable unalienable and indefeasible Right to reform, alter or abolish it, and to establish another, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public Weal; and that the Doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary Power and Oppression is absurd, slavish and destructive of the good and Happiness of Mankind. 4. That no man or Set of Men are entitled to exclusive or separate public Emoluments or privileges from the Community, but in Consideration of public Services; which not being descendable neither ought the Offices of Magistrate, Legislator or Judge, or any other public Office, to be hereditary. 5. That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government should be separate and distinct; and that the Members of the Two first may be restrained from Oppression, by feeling and participating [in] the public Burthens, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private Station, return into the Mass of the people, and the Vacancies be supplied by certain and regular Elections, in which all, or any part of the Former Members to be eligible or ineligible, as the Rules of the Constitution of Government and the Laws shall direct. 6. That the Right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best Security of Liberty, and the Foundation of all Free Governments; for this purpose Elections ought to be free and frequent; and all men having sufficient Evidence of permanent common Interest with, and Attachment to the Community, ought to have the Right of Suffrage:21 [820]And no Aid, Charge, Tax or Fee can be set, rated or levied upon the People without their own Consent, or that of their Representatives so elected; nor can they be bound by any Law to which they have not in like manner assented for the Public Good. 7. That all power of suspending Laws, or the Execution of Laws by any Authority, without Consent of the Representatives of the People in the Legislature, is injurious to their Rights, and ought not to be exercised. 8. That in all Capital or Criminal Prosecutions, a Man hath a Right to demand the Cause & Nature of his Accusation, to be confronted with the Accusers and Witnesses, to call for Evidence and be admitted Counsel in his Favor, and to a fair and speedy Trial by an impartial Jury of his Vicinage, without whose unanimous Consent he cannot be found guilty, (except in the Government of the Land and Naval Forces in Time of actual War, Invasion or Rebellion) nor can he be compelled to give Evidence against himself. 9. That no Freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or desseized of his Freehold, Liberties, Privileges or Franchises, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his Life, Liberty or Property, but by the Law of the Land. 10. That every Freeman restrained of his Liberty is entitled to a Remedy, to enquire into the Lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same if unlawful, and that such Remedy ought not to be denied or delayed. 11. That in Controversies respecting Property, and in Suits between Man and Man, the ancient Trial by Jury of Facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest Securities to the Rights of a Free people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable. 12. That every Freeman ought to find a certain Remedy, by Recourse to the Laws, for all Injuries or Wrongs he may receive in his person, property or Character: He ought to obtain Right and Justice freely, without sale, compleatly and without Denial, promptly and without Delay; and that all Establishments or Regulations contravening these Rights are oppressive and unjust. 13. That excessive Bail ought not to be required, nor excessive Fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted. 14. That every22 Freeman has a Right to be secure from all unreasonable Searches and Seizures of his Person, his papers, and his property; all Warrants therefore to search suspected places, or to seize any Freeman, his Papers or property, without23 Information upon Oath (or Affirmation of a person religiously scrupulous of taking an Oath) of legal and sufficient Cause, are grievous and Oppressive; and all [821]General Warrants to search suspected Places, or to apprehend any suspected Person, without specially naming or describing the Place or Person, are dangerous and ought not to be granted. 15. That the People have a Right peaceably to assembly together to consult for their common Good, or to instruct their Representatives, and24 that every Freeman has a Right to petition or apply to the Legislature for Redress of Greivances. 16. That the People have a Right to Freedom of Speech, and of writing and publishing their Sentiments; that the Freedom of the Press is one of the great Bulwarks of Liberty, and ought not to be violated. 17. That the People have a Right to keep and to bear Arms; that a well regulated Militia, composed of the Body of the People, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe Defence of a free State; that Standing Armies in Time of Peace are dangerous to Liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided as far as the Circumstances and Protection of the Community will admit; and that in all Cases, the Military should be under strict Subordination to, and governed by the Civil Power. 18. That no Soldier in Time of Peace ought to be quartered in any House without the Consent of the Owner; and in Time of War, only by the civil Magistrate in such Manner as the Laws direct. 19. That any Person religiously scrupulous25 of bearing Arms26 ought to be exempted upon payment of an Equivalent to employ another to bear Arms in his stead. 20. That Religion or the Duty which we owe to our Creator, and the Manner of discharging it, can be directed only by Reason and Conviction, not by Force or Violence, and therefore all Men have an equal, natural, and unaleinable Right to the free Exercise of Religion according to the Dictates of Conscience, and that no particular Religious Sect or Society of Christians ought to be favored or established by Law in preference to others. That each State in the Union shall retain its Sovereignty, Freedom and Independence, and every Power, Jurisdiction and Right which is not by this Constitution expressly delegated to the Congress of the United States. That there shall be one Representative for every Thirty Thousand Persons according to the Enumeration or Census mentioned in the Constitution until the whole Number of Representatives amounts to Two Hundred. That Congress shall not exercise the Powers respecting the Regulation of Elections, vested in them by the Fourth Section of the First Article of the Constitution, but in Cases when a State neglects or [822]refuses to make the Regulations therein mentioned, or shall make Regulations subversive of the Rights of the People to a free and equal Representation in Congress agreeably to the Constitution, or shall be prevented from making Elections by Invasion or Rebellion; and in any of these Cases, such Powers shall be exercised by the Congress only until the Cause be removed. That the Congress do not lay direct Taxes, nor Excises upon any Articles of the Growth, or manufactured from the Growth of any of the American States, but when the Monies arising from the Duties on Imports are insufficient for the public Exigencies; nor then until the Congress shall have first made a Requisition upon the States, to assess, levy and pay their respective Proportions of such Requisitions according to the Enumeration or Census fixed in the Constitution, in such Way and Manner as the Legislature of the State shall judge best; and if any State shall neglect or refuse to pay its proportion pursuant to such Requisition, then Congress may assess and levy such States’ proportion, together with Interest thereon, at the Rate of Six per Centum per Annum, from the Time of Payment prescribed in such Requisition. That the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives shall be ineligible to, and incapable of holding any Office under the Authority of the United States, during the Time for which they shall respectively be elected. (a) That there shall be a constitutional responsible Council, to assist in the Administration of Government, with the Power of chusing out of their own Body, a President, who in case of the Death, Resignation or Disability of the President of the United States, shall act, pro tempore, as Vice President instead of a Vice President elected in the Manner prescribed by the Constitution; and that the Power of making Treaties, appointing Ambassadors, other public Ministers or Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Courts, and all other Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution, and which shall be established by Law, be vested in the president of the United States with the Assistance of the Council so to be appointed. But all Treaties so made or entered into, shall be subject to the Revision of the Senate and House of Representatives for their Ratification. And no Commercial Treaty shall be ratified without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members present in both Houses; nor shall any Treaty ceding, contracting, restraining or suspending the Territorial Rights or Claims of the United States, or any of them, or their or any of their Rights or Claims to fishing in the American Seas, or navigating the American Rivers be ratified without [823]the Consent of Three-Fourths of the Whole Number of the Members of both Houses. No Navigation Law, or Law for regulating Commerce, shall be passed without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members present in both Houses. No Standing Army or Regular Troops shall be raised or kept up in Time of Peace without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members of both Houses. Neither the president, nor Vice President of the United States, nor any Member of the Council, shall command the Army or Navy of the United States in person, without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members of both Houses. No Soldier shall be enlisted for a longer Term than four Years, except in Time of War, and then for no longer Term than the Continuance of the War. No Mutiny Act shall be passed for any longer Term than Two Years. The President of the United States, or any other Officer acting under the Authority of the United States shall, upon Impeachment, be suspended from the Exercise of his Office during his Trial. The Judges of the Federal Court shall be incapable of holding any other Office, or of receiving the Profits of any other Office or Emolument under the United States or any of them. (a)This Article not yet finally agreed upon by the Committee appointed to prepare the amendments.—"
Newspaper,No,Denatus,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/11/1788,"To the Members of the Virginia Federal Convention, collectively, and individually. Gentlemen, Happy in the enjoyment of my own reflections, the tranquility of my neighbours, and the peace and prosperity of every good man, I pass a great part of my time in solitude. At these periods, the federal constitution, with the criticisms of the wise upon it, made their appearance. Considering the work itself, I could not bring it within my view. To me, the commentators have bewildered the subject, and hid it from my mind, in impenetrable obscurity. After reading it three times carefully, I formed an opinion, which I still retain, and which, daily, sinks deeper into my belief. That opinion I now lay before you, in hopes that some thought of mine, may be worthy of observation and contribute to the general good. Men of learning and experience, judge of others with humanity. You have too much liberality, and too great a desire for the improvement of every useful degree of human study, to blame me for this address. Those who determine without reason, may think otherwise: to them I reply, That all men have as great a right, either together, or in opposition to each other, to reason upon suppositions, as upon facts, and to censure the conduct of men, as to approve it; that evil may be prevented, by the fear of blame and punishment: for all men, in the same society, have a right to enquire into all opinions, to examine all subjects, to represent all grievances, to shew what laws are pernicious or defective, and to lay before the public their sentiments, agreeable to truth. Where this reciprocation is not allowed, social liberty is in a great measure destroyed.—The press is the vehicle of this intelligence—I will enjoy the privilege, and return to the matter in hand. I object to the said constitution, generally, and specially—but, wish that it may be adopted, and if possible, with amendments.—This appears strange. Be pleased to suspend your opinions, until you hear my reasons. I renounce it entirely, because, in my opinion, it was composed [1600]without any legal authority. As far as I can learn, the express purpose of the convention was, to revise and amend, the articles of the union. Instead of this, which they had law to do, they followed their own imaginations, contrary to law. Instead of repairing the old and venerable fabrick, which sheltered the United States, from the dreadful and cruel storms of a tyrannical British ministry, they built a stately palace after their own fancies, and in every convenient part of the floor, and of the foundation, securely planted the seeds of monarchy. In the equity of things, it avails nothing, to say, if the people do not like it, they may let it alone. The innovation, and the injury to public justice, is still the same. Had they preserved only one article of the union, and built the present constitution to it, the objection of innovation would be unreasonable: But they have done what you know. A more fatal innovation may be made at a future day, for as Junius says, “one precedent creates another, they soon accumulate and constitute law—What yesterday was fact, to-day is doctrine—Examples are supposed to justify the most dangerous measures, and where they do not suit exactly, the defect is supplied by analogy.”1 Supposing the above objection had never existed. I remonstrate against the constitution, because, to me it appears incomprehensible and indefinite. For these divine attributes, its pious friends, say, by way of encomium, that it is a gift from heaven—Such observers know very little of gifts from heaven: but enthusiasts must rave. I will venture to make a bold observation here I think the sun never shone upon a man that could take it within his view—No being, that we have any knowledge of, but the Deity, can see through it—God, the first cause of all things, sees through the whole down to the final effect.—Contracted man, takes the effect, and struggles up to the cause; then, along the steps he has ascended, looks down to the effect again—This is the way that mechanics regulate their ideas.—A millwright stands at the water-wheel, and mentally sees the cause and effect of every movement in a complicated flour-mill, regularly on to the meal-trough—he then understands the machinery—If he cannot see, regularly along to the meal-trough, he does not understand it.—The water, is the cause of every movement—The mechanic knows how every thing will happen—The constitution, if adopted, will be the cause acting upon the conduct of men and nations.—And where is the man who can see through the constitution to its effects? The constitution of a wise and free people, ought to be as evident to simple reason, as the letters of our alphabet—This constitution I think is calculated for men of high monarchical principles, and to swallow up the constitutions of the different states. Human nature ever hath, is, and will be the same, while this world continues under the same divine law.—History in all ages, affords instances of this truth too shocking to be mentioned. Let any man examine his own mind, and he will discover a mixture of democratical, aristocratical, and monarchical principles; and perhaps I would not be far wrong, to add, despotic and tyrannical.—Let whoever doubts of this, turn his attention sharply, to any man he is acquainted with.—Suppose then, the simile is directly in point.—That an uncommonly strong man possessed of every implement of war, and thirteen weak men, but denied the use of any weapon of defence, were to receive a grant of lands, in some uninhabited part of the world, and by mutual agreement, proposed by this same strong man to be governed by him, in such a manner, that no matter what any of them did, or might desire to do, for the happiness of all,—it could be of no effect, unless it agreed at that time with his peculiar cast of mind, because, not their voices, but his, must be the supreme law of the land.—Would not these thirteen men be very simple.—And if this mighty strong man would twist their heads off, some day in his wrath—Is it not what might be naturally expected? I’ll tell you how he would act. Common decency, and the shame which naturally attends the outset of an unjustifiable course of life, would induce him to exercise in conju[n]ction, those attributes of his soul, which were the purer parts of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. This time would be the happiest of their days.—By and by the latent qualities of power, and hatred of restraint, having gathered strength, from time, and conscious superiority, would bury democracy, and incline him to move the land mark a little. The people remonstrate against the encroachment—The aristocrat, makes a parade of bombastical wisdom, says the land-mark was not evidently fixed upon the face of the ground, but only ideal—The people seem satisfied.—He studies their imbecility, and moveth the land-mark a little farther.—The people exclaim against this violation of plighted faith—By this time he has become a monarch in his own intentions, claps his hand on his sword to unarmed men, gives a stamp, and moveth the land mark farther still.—The people exclaim to heaven against him for redress, and say, that to each man he promised to guarantee the full possession of his property—Guarantee! says the tyrant, true I did, but you see now, I do not choose to do it, and where is the power to compel me? Heaven is neuter in this second dispute.—The genius of real liberty, who had waded through seas of blood to crush oppression and licentiousness, whispers these to unhappy men. The tyrant perceives the conference, draws his sword, and pronounces the following words—You see I have the command of every weapon of war. I am a [1602]man mighty in battle: You are destitute of any thing to defend yourselves. I have every necessary for two years; you can command nothing; and if you do not quietly relinquish the whole of your possessions, into my management, before the end of twelve months I will sacrifice you as a striking example to succeeding ages, that those people who inconsiderately resign their natural rights into the hands of others may expect the same fate. I object to it also, because, it appears to be a huddled piece of work: and (that in the general bustle) they forgot to put a bill of rights to it. A bill of rights! say Mr. Wilson and others, to confederated powers, is unnecessary2—Very truly, to powers properly confederated, but this is no confederation. It is a national government, i. e. through a little time, the incroachment will so prevail, that the federal constitution will expunge entirely the state constitutions—It appears to be a confederation now, but the monarch who is asleep in its bosom, at a convenient time, will awaken with a vengeance!—There would be no need of a bill of rights, were the states properly confederated. The land-mark clearly drawn between the powers that give, and the power given:—And where the remaining parts of the powers that give, are ever to be held sacred by the power given. The remaining parts of the powers that give, or the residue, of our state constitutions, would be a bill of rights, to the power given, or the federal constitution. Had this distinction been clearly fixed, so as to prevent any future controversy, the constitution in question, would have been a glorious, and an immortal example of human wisdom. But alas! this is not the case—There is no barrier to the power of the federal constitution. It will easily overleap our state constitutions with impunity. When this comes to be the case, and the federal constitution sovereign in all things, we ought to have a bill of rights, to save us from oppression. The want of this, is of an alarming nature, and I hope will be one of your amendments. Had the creator of the universe thought proper to form mankind without selfish and dissocial passions, I think I can maintain, that we would be happy, and in little need of human government. Reason, or the internal voice of infinite wisdom, would be the sole conductor of man.—But for purposes best known to this almighty sovereign of pure goodness and order, we are subject to many jarring propensities. Among these, vanity, ambition, and the love of riches, are not the least.—While reason and conscience can confine the passions, their action and reaction on each other, constitute human happiness. But, when they overcome reason and conscience, they produce our misery. To guard against this misfortune, as much as human foresight could [1603]discover, ought to have been the chief business of the late Federal Convention. This necessary and heavy part of the work is not mentioned in the constitution, and for this reason I object to it—Some will say this is no objection—It would have been simple in the convention to debate on preventing those things which have no being, and which, if necessary, may be done by Congress at a future period. I may be wrong, but in my way of thinking, it is an objection, for the source of all the revolutions and calamities that ever will befal the United States of America, lie dormant in the human mind this very day. The prevention of these misfortunes, which will flow from the passions, instead of being utterly neglected, ought to have employed the most solemn moments of the convention, and ought to have been the point, to which all their views should have tended. Here it may be asked “and pray, Sir, what do you wish should have been done?” Far be it from me, so contracted in my views and experience, to say absolutely, that any thing should have been done. As I have, I will continue to give my opinion as the constitution of a free people ought to be formed in the best possible manner for the happiness of them, and their posterity, it ought to contain some mode, rivited through its very essence, for the present and succeeding ages, to be educated in the principles of morality, religion, jurisprudence, and the art of war. This is a duty which the framers of a constitution owe to posterity.—For the neglect of which, by men so famed for wisdom, very few excuses indeed, can be admissable—The first, or second article of the said constitution, ought to contain something to this effect—That as soon as possible, academies shall be established at every proper place throughout the United States for the education of youth in morality; the principles of the christian religion without regard to any sect, but pure and unadulterated as left by its divine author and his apostles: The principles of natural, civil, and common law, and of our constitution: And the art of defending and conquering nations in battle, either by land or sea—These academies to be regulated from time to time by Congress, and their establishment to be perpetual. As man is an accountable being, to his creator and to his fellow-creatures, the study of morality would enable him to act consistent with his duty to society, and the study of religion, with his duty to God. I will venture to affirm, that was this mode established we would have fewer law suits, less backbiting, slander, and mean observations, more industry, justice and real happiness, than at present. Says a pious writer, “be careful not to neglect religion in the education of your children, in vain will you endeavour to conduct them by any other path: If they are dear to you, if from them you expect to receive credit [1604]or comfort from religion must be derived their happiness and your own.” Another elegant writer observes nearly in the same manner, speaking to a father of his son. “Teach him science, and his life will be useful. Teach him religion and his death will be happy.” The study of jurisprudence would prepare our young men, and our old men, for every department of public business. They would be qualified, in point of education, for every office at home, and as their virtues and genius merited, would be appointed consuls or ambassadors abroad. Far other is the case now. How absurd it is, to send men to do the business of which they, are ignorant. To make laws, and unacquainted with the principal ties of social union. If this remark is thought hard, I appeal to our late acts of Assembly, and to the sufferings of the nineteen-twentieths of our people. The multiplicity of our jarring laws—Their inconsistency in some instances, with common sense—The honest man being pointed at by the Assembly, ever since the revolution—The struggle for instalments3—The execution law4—The perspicuity of the district law,5 and to crown all the tenacious continuance of the holy six months law—I think ought to cool the enthusiasm of every anti federalist. Were these academies established, the study of the art-military, and the militia exercise, would qualify us for crushing at once, every enemy to our government, foreign or domestic. Like the Roman generals we would have the statesman and the warrior united in the same man—Our people educated in this manner, at stated times, would put the theory of fortification, gunnery, and manouvering of armies into practice. We would march, encamp, have mock battles and sieges, go through every part of the military duty as if in real war, then return home, prepare our arms for a moments warning, and each man fall to his occupation as before. This would guard against effeminacy: It is the natural way to enjoy the sweets of society, and to prevent any nation, or people from disturbing our quiet. We see in private life, that the man who wishes to hector over another, is more sound than substance, and when he meets with manly opposition, fights at a distance. He does not turn out hand to hand, alone, and on equal terms, as a brave man ought to do, but fights most valiantly, throughout the regions of fancy: So it is in nations. Would Portugal choose to declare war against France or England? Would any of the powers contiguous to Russia, choose to declare war against that empire? I think they would not, because they would be conscious of having to contend with a superior power, and according to my way of thinking, if the United States of America were wisely cemented together, as one people and properly educated in the sciences of morality, theology, jurisprudence, [1605]and war, the greatest of the forementioned powers would not dare to insult either our citizens or our ships. The great art in this business would be, to regulate the militia in such a manner that neither agriculture, industry, commerce, nor the military spirit should suffer. I think Congress could soon complete this organization. What occasion then, would we have for a standing army? That dead weight upon the heart of nations! That disgraceful and wicked instrument in the hands of conscious worthlessness and guilt! High or low—rich or poor—citizen or governor, subject, king or president, the good man’s character will ever be his guard—The wicked ought to suffer. How fluctuating are the dissocial passions of men! These are the cause of the rise and fall of nations and the changes of government. Some time ago, the regal power was sovereign in America—Since, democratical republicanism now nearly anarchy, and without great care, it is not unlikely but we may soon experience a change worse than either. These revolutions are a lesson, to be cautious, of what powers, and for what time, the president of Congress should be appointed—He ought by no means to command the forces of the United States, without leave from Congress—nor to be eligible successively—and never after being twice in office—none of his brothers, uncles, sons, first cousins—nor father ought to fill the same post during his natural life—after governing he ought to be governed, to prevent his despotic principles from making head. The conduct of Dejoces [Deioces], Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, and what Hannibal might have done, had he returned victorious from Italy to Carthage, and also, how the present empress of Russia ascended the throne,6 ought ever to be held in view when the powers of this president are in contemplation. The above in part, are my objections to the federal constitution, each of which, is a genus. As I am a warm friend to the union, and to justice among its individuals—I will object no more—My sincere prayer is, that it may be amended, and then adopted—It certainly has a great many excellent qualities, and as many bad ones. The ambiguity of the whole, is its greatest fault. I remember, in a public court yard, to have heard a baptist preacher make three score and sixteen objections to it, and grunt and condemn it from end to end7—and within five minutes a practitioner of the law, to defend it most vociferously from end to end.—A blacksmith at my elbow, pitied them both—I really thought then, what I still think, that we all knew very little about it. If we adopt it without amendments, the seeds of our ruin are sown. If we reject it, disunion, the highest injustice, perhaps anarchy, and thousands of calamities will be the consequence—The people are impatient and will not consider things cooly—In my opinion, the safest [1606]way would be, to adopt it with amendments. When the whole, or nine states have come into the measure—to lay the ratifications and amendments from all the states, before General Washington, and from the whole, for him to select and make what alterations shall appear best—He certainly knows the natural rights of mankind, the general interests of this country; its natural and artificial productions, and upon the scale of nature with other nations to what they may become, and also, this genius of the people, better than any other man. And whether his amendment would agree with speculative reasoning, or not, his name to sanctify the whole. Well knowing I address men whose souls are expanded, by education, humanity and experience, I am at ease, with respect to the imperfections of this composition, either on account of its sentiments, or its language—I am subject to human frailty; but mean well. As I am not known to some, and but very little indeed to any of you, it is no matter who or what I am—If this address can have the smallest good effect I will be happy. This much however I will observe, that I am a foreigner, and with yourselves may say, of the same ancestors, the same language, the same government, the same religion, and the same spirit we are all branches of the same tree. You towards the trunk, I towards the top: and if the branches towards the top are longer in making their appearance, than those towards the trunk, is their any essential difference in their qualities? Are they not homogeneous? Do they not collectively unite to the utility and beauty of the whole: And do we not conjointly, contribute to the glory of that power who gave us existence, to dwell in peace, harmony, and brotherly affection upon the same land? There is one thing, particularly, which I beg leave to observe—I hope it will be of more benefit than all I have written. You are now on business of the most awful nature. Upon your wisdom, Virginia rests her future happiness. Let not then, any degree of party-work, nor any kind of fallacious arguments, destroy the patriotic emanations of the soul. It is noble, it is great and glorious to acknowledge mistakes. Be like brothers, and we will be happy. All cannot be right, perhaps not one, throughout the system he may have in view. Gather the best parts of all, together, and throw the rest away. Consider the imperfections of human knowledge, and how often the greatest men have erred. Aristotle and Des Cartes themselves have gone astray in some things. Let social affection shine through all your conduct. Advise like brothers, but do not debate like foes. With reverential awe view your chairman as your father, studying the happiness of his children, and [1607]may he who presides over the councils of good men give you wisdom and unanimity. Buckingham, May 27th, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A New-Light,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/11/1788,"Mr. DAVIS, By inserting the following dream, or vision, (I do not know which to call it) you will give your readers an opportunity to ruminate on the great vivacity of our minds, when our bodies are in a measure dead, or the extraordinary method the All-wise creator takes at sometimes to warn us of some impending important event; for it is said in scripture that “he speaks to young men by visions in the night.”2 I was a few evenings past thinking seriously on what might, or might not be the consequence of the thirteen states of America’s ratifying, or refusing to ratify, the new constitution; which led me naturally to consider of the general disposition of the citizens of those states, I at first adverted to the year, seventy five, and did not hesitate one moment to determine that such a government proposed to people of the disposition we then possessed would meet with general approbation. But when I revolved through the different changes from that time to this, and took a view of the reigning corruption of the present times, I was at a loss how to determine; whether a good government in motion, or no government at all, would be attended with the most alarming consequences! and was most inclined to suppose that nothing would bring us back to virtue but a severe chastising rod! I felt melancholy under the consideration that the innocent must suffer with the guilty, and in this situation fell insensibly into a slumber, and into the following [1608]dream.—I thought I was walking the streets of Richmond about the dusk of evening, when I came to a house where I had frequently been, I walked up the steps and into the outer room, upon entering of which I heard a voice pronounce “We have all full confidence in each other, and therefore may be free in communicating our minds.” I at first was at a loss how to act, whether to turn out of the room or satisfy my curiosity with the approaching conversation. I was well aware they had not discovered me, and also knew the voices of some of them; and finding they were a select company of sworn friends, and conceiving that I might gather something to my advantage (though I felt somewhat ashamed of the determination) concluded that I would seat myself and hear the conference—Upon which I heard one of an insinuating tone of voice say—“There never was nor (perhaps) never will be, so favorable a time to lay a sure foundation for our future glory.” You see, my friends! that I at this day have Virginia in my hand, as it were, if we can baffle the designs of those canting federalists who wish to establish the proposed constitution, anarchy will be the natural consequence; and that we may do so, I conceive very easy. You observe that the greatest advocates for it agree that it has its defects; this is the ground on which we must attack most freely—our friend Gerry has prudently observed that no enlightened people ought ever to receive a government, which they are conscious wants amendments3—this we must urge, at the same time profess ourselves anxious for a good federal government, and declare nothing would give us equal pleasure—by this means we infatuate the minds of the weak and make them believe we oppose the present form from a consciousness that we shall thereby obtain a better; this at once determines them to oppose it, and we thereby obtain our ends, and as I said before anarchy will be the certain consequence, and when the community gets into complete disorder, who so fit to take rule over them, or so likely to obtain it, as those whom they conceive to be their best guardians?—I will then publish a pompous proclamation as full of dissimulation as my capacious heart can devise, inviting the inhabitants of Virginia to take sanctuary from oppression under the banner of freedom! asserting that no judiciary shall have power to compel them to pay their former debts, especially those of a public nature, or due to British merchants; by these and other infatuating measures we shall secure to ourselves a majority of Virginians, and almost all North-Carolina—By which means we shall establish an independent empire to ourselves. I will be their supreme ruler, and you shall be my counsellors—Your indefatigable industry in poisoning the minds of the ignorant since our last conference on this important business, gives me the highest confidence [1609]in your attachment and fidility. Art and industry never fails of success—Here it was that I was seized with a tremour which I thought would bring on my dissolution, from which I was in some measure relieved by the great extasy into which the minds of the company were elated—they announced their joy, by three huzzas! which awoke me—And though I am inclined to believe it was a dream, I really think it portends something of consequence, which occasions me to desire you will insert it for the public’s perusal. June 8, 1788."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/11/1788,"Although the senate and house of representatives are to be established, and it seems to be the spirit of the proposed plan of government, that they should be considered as the grand deputation of America—the great aggregate body, to whom shall be delegated the important trust of representing the whole nation—the august, puissant assembly, in whom shall reside the full majesty of the people: yet, it seems too, these alone shall not be sufficient to exercise the powers of legislation. It is ordained, as a necessary expedient in the fœderal government, that a president of the United States (who is to hold the supreme executive power) should also concur in passing every law. In monarchy, where the established maxim is, that the king should be respected as a great and transcendent personage, who knows no equal—who in his royal political capacity can commit no wrong—to whom no evil can be ascribed—in whom exists the height of perfection—who is supreme above all, and accountable to no earthly being, it is consistent with such a maxim, that the prince should form a constituent branch of the legislature, and that his power of rejecting whatever has been passed by the other branches should be distinct, and co-extensive with that of either of those branches in rejecting what has been proposed and consented to by the other. It is necessary that the fundamental laws of the realm should ascribe to the king those [1610]high and eminent attributes—that he should possess in himself the sovereignty of the nation; and that the regal dignity should distinguish him, as superior to all his subjects, and in his political character endowed with certain inherent qualities, which cannot be supposed to reside in any other individual within the kingdom: otherwise, that constitutional independence, which the laws meant peculiarly to establish in his person, would not be preserved. To this end the king of England is invested with the sole executive authority, and a branch of legislative jurisdiction so far as to pass his negative on all proceedings of the other two branches, or to confirm them by his assent. This secures to him the intended superiority in the constitution, and gives him the ascendant in government; else his sovereignty would become a shadow—whilst that doctrine, whereby he is declared to be the head, the beginning and end of the great body politic, would prove to be nothing more than mere sound. This two-fold jurisdiction established in the British monarch being founded on maxims extremely different from those, which prevail in the American States, the writer hereof is inclined to hope that he will not be thought singular, if he conceives an impropriety in assimilating the component parts of the American government to those of the British: and as the reasons, which to the founders of the British constitution were motives superior to all others to induce them thus to give the executive a controul over the legislative, are so far from existing in this country, that every principle of that kind is generally, if not universally, exploded; so it should appear that the same public spirit, which pervades the nation, would proclaim the doctrine of prerogative and other peculiar properties of the royal character, as incompatible with the view of these states when they are settling the form of a republican government. Is it not therefore sufficient that every branch in the proposed system be distinct and independent of each other—that no one branch might receive any accession of power (by taking part of another) which would tend to overturn the balance and thereby endanger the very being of the constitution? Whilst the king of England enjoys all the regalia, which are annexed to his crown—whilst he exercises a transcendent dominion over his subjects, the existence whereof is coeval with the first rudiments of their constitution—let the free citizens of America, consulting their true national happiness, wish for no innovation, but what is regulated according to the scale of equal liberty, or which may not destroy that liberty by too great a share of power being lodged in any particular hands;—let this collateral jurisdiction, which constitutes the royal negative, be held by kings alone, since with kings it first originated:—Let [1611]this remain in its native soil, as most congenial to it; there it will cumber less, and be more productive,—here it will be an exotick, and may poison the stock, in which it may be engrafted. It will be said, perhaps, that the power, granted the president, of approving or disapproving the proceedings, which have passed the senate and house of representatives, will not be so decisive in its nature as the king’s negative. True it is, this power of rejecting does not extend so far as primarily to produce an entire overthrow of any law, which has passed those two houses: but it may be expected that in many instances this negative will amount to a final and conclusive rejection. For as a law, which has been once disapproved by the president, cannot be re-passed without the agreement of two-thirds of both houses, there can be no doubt, it will frequently happen that this concurrence of two thirds cannot be obtained. The law must then fall: and thus the president, although he has not the power of resolving originally and enacting any laws, independent of those two houses, hath nevertheless in the legislative scale of government a weight almost equal to that of two thirds of the whole Congress. If the system proposed had been calculated to extend his authority a little farther, he would preponderate against all—he alone would possess the sovereignty of America. For if the whole executive authority and an absolute, entire negative on the legislature should become united in one person, these must, with regard to that person, destroy every idea of a subject. Thus circumstanced he cannot be the object of any laws; he will be above all law: as none can be enacted without his consent—he will be elevated to the height of supremacy.— How near will the president approach to this consummate degree of power! The portion allotted him may, however, be amply sufficient to give him the ascendant in the constitution. He must continually acquire great accessions of weight in every scale of government, as chief magistrate and generalissimo of the United States—at the same time possessing so great a share in the legislature, as a revision of all bills and other proceedings which shall have passed the senate and house of representatives with a discretionary right of rejecting them—united with the senate in making treaties, appointing all public ministers, judges, and a train of other officers, who will be necessary for carrying on the business of government; thus dispensing honor and profit throughout America—whilst copious streams of influence must flow from him, as from a source. Can the different departments be duly balanced when all these high powers concenter in one branch? Is it not rather probable that this branch will destroy the balance, and eventually rise to the fulness of dominion? When the spirit of America becomes such, as to ascribe to their president all those extraordinary qualities, which the subjects of kingly governments ascribe to their princes: then, it is presumed, and not till then, he may consistently be invested with a power similar to theirs. It is remarkable how the president and senate mutually participate in the exercise of a two-fold jurisdiction. How, then, can it be surprising to any one, if some citizens, truly jealous of their liberties, are alarmed with the apprehensions of aristocracy? Those, who seriously reflect on the properties of human nature, and who possess republican principles, will suppose they conceive grounds for such apprehensions: those, who have different sentiments, will not care whether there are grounds for such apprehensions, or not."
Letter,No,Theodorick Bland,Arthur Lee,,,6/13/1788,"Dear Arthur, I was yesterday favored with yours and assure you I am in doubt whether the Pleasure or the pain on the subject of your congratulation affects me at this time most sensibly—On the one hand I see my Country on the point of embarking and launching into a troubled Ocean without Chart or Compass to direct them, one half the Crew hoisting sail for the land of Energy—and the other looking with a longing aspect on the Shore of Liberty—I have but one Ray of hope and that arises from an observation that they are yet in perfect good humour with each other—I have as yet sat as a speechless spectator—nor shall I be induced to alter that character but as a mediator—and with the view of concentrating the two parties now (after 12 days Session) almost equally divided, each side boasting by turns of a majority of (from three to eight,) on the General question of adoption or rejection, altho. I really at this time think there is a decided majority for anterior amendments that is, who do not think it prudent to mount a fiery high-blooded Steed without a bridle—the amendments which will be proposed, will contain simple propositions, guarding the rights of States and of individuals from the encroachments of Tyrants, and State factions in the General government, and almost literally corresponding with those suggested by Massachusetts, Carolina, and the main points of the committee of Maryland2—Strong, nay the strongest efforts are made here to inculcate the absolute necessity of posterior amendments or unconditional Submission for fear of loosing as tis called the government, and strong dispositions are shewn to precipitate the convention into that measure—but hitherto the fear of miscarrying altogether has restrained the Gent. on the side of the new Constitution—I have no doubt of their bringing forward the division whenever they shall think they are strong enough—on the other hand we have declared pretty openly our advances to them which has had considerable weight with the wavering—and have drawn many doubtfull minds to our side of the Question—we object not against any powers, which shall not be hurtfull—that the government shall want no aids for its own support or execution provided that such restraints shall be imposed upon it, as shall support and ensure the state priviledges, and the liberty of the Individual against oppression— We have yet proceeded no further in the discussion than the article of direct Taxation, on which point they have collected all their force, and I think have left hitherto the advantage considerably on our Side—the [1618]General and, I may say diffuse discussion may go on probably another week—perhaps not so long—& then it is proposed to argue it paragraph by paragraph—the issue will depend greatly on management on both sides and some fortuitous events—as in all cases where forces are nearly equal—there has been a duel here between (Fountain?) & Macon—on the score of an Election Macon is dangerously Wounded3 they are neither of them in the Convention—I mention this to shew you that heats have not yet entered that body, and that they are not yet Ignited altho. Thunders Roll and lightenings flash every day both in the Natural and Political Atmosphere—Our chief Magistrate4 has at length taken his partie, and appears to be reprobated by the honest on both sides—but is too precious a morsel to be spued out, altho. lukewarm, he has openly declared for anterior amendment or in other words unconditional submission— I have got a cold am sick—and am obliged to declare to you sooner than I would have done that I am Yr.

Newspaper,No,Many,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/18/1788,"Mr. Davis, The public is under great obligations to you, for the fund of entertainment and instruction, your paper has afforded since the publication of the proposed federal constitution: the most illiterate may now discern the usefulness of the press in a free state. It gives all the people an opportunity to learn and be wise, to choose or refuse, in an important affair: indeed it is the noblest exhibition, the new world has yet witnessed. Let us therefore seek after truth, no matter where, or from whom. We see our way now more clearly than at first outset; several of our objections have been ably answered. But so attached are we to old forms, or from some other cause, we are not yet satisfied, with the want of what is called a BILL of RIGHTS.—What, if the expression was varied, and it should be termed incontrovertable truths, or fundamental laws—Why might not the new constitution be prefaced by such an instrument of writing? The use we would wish to see made of it, is a resort, or recurrence, a test, to try all the acts of the national legislature by.—It is known that the bulk of the people do not understand abstruse, or lengthy political disquisitions. The fundamental laws of a nation, might be expressed in a few articles, and those in a few words, yet plain, and pithy, to which the people would pay a similar deference, as to the decalogue. The explanations we have seen respecting the trial by jury, the freedom of the press, election of representatives, rotation in office, and responsibility to constituents are plausible, but not altogether satisfactory. But how will the FREEHOLDER,2 or any other candid writer, take to convince us, that it is right that treaties should be made the supreme [1639]law of the land. We have hitherto been taught that all laws binding on the community, ought to be made with the consent of the people, or by that of their representatives, in their legislative capacity. But under the new constitution, Congress is to enact some laws, others to be enacted by a part of Congress, or one branch of the legislature, and these to be made supreme.3 We apprehend the Freeholder, or even Cassius,4 will see some impropriety in this. PUBLIUS, the oracle of the federalists, in his paper no 15—says that treaties even among civilized nations, “scarcely are formed, before they are broken, giving an instructive, but afflicting lesson to mankind, how little dependance is to be placed on treaties, which have no other sanctions, but the obligations of good faith; and which oppose general considerations of peace, and justice, to the impulse of any immediate interest or passion.”5 The whole of the paper is worth the reader’s attentive perusal. Would a sensible and free people, covet to have the supreme laws of their land, impressed with such “lovely features.” Since the year 1776, the United States, by commissioners acting under their authority, have made a variety of treaties, with different nations of Savages; some of them if considered as law, will destroy the private rights of individuals without an hearing; infringe the sovereignty of States, are contradictory one with another; and in not a few instances manifestly unjust. Can the Indians give us constitutional security for the observation of stipulations on their part? What embarrasments must the Judges of the federal courts be under, when they come to pronounce, what is the supreme law of the land.6 They are either to be accessaries to a multiplicity of wrongs, or endure the imputation of trifling with the obligations of a solemn oath. Such generally are the consequences of expost facto regulations. Treaties, no doubt, are engagements of a solemn nature, and it is interesting to humanity that they be faithfully observed, provided the sanctions to oblige the parties to do so, are reciprocal. At all events, if PUBLIUS’s account of them are true, they are improper matter, to make part of a code of laws, for the local administration of the national affairs. In a serious hour, and in the presence of the Governor of the Universe, what reasonable excuse can then be made, for permitting, and that constitutionally, depredations on a distant and inoffensive people, for the term of twenty-one years.7—Seemingly in the same spirit, and with the same narrow policy, is the clause expressed ambiguously for the admission of NEW STATES into the Union. Art. 11 of the confederation is expressed in a different style.8 There are many good things, excellent regulations, set forth in the [1640]new plan, that will long be respected by a grateful, and enlightened people. But when we turn our eyes to the dark side of the picture, a sigh, a tear, a lamentation, may be excited, for the imperfections that beset the best of men, and that attends the wisest institutions, whilst we are destined to act on the present theatre of human affairs. Such are the sentiments of MANY. May 13, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A Well-Wisher to Good Government,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/18/1788,"A well-wisher to good Government, with all due deference to the Honorable and very respectable Assembly now convened at Richmond, begs leave to submit the following amendment to the new Constitution as worthy of their attention. For maintaining and preserving this Constitution inviolate—there shall be established one Supreme Censorial Court, which shall be called the Court of Ariopagus,1 which Court shall be composed of the Chief Justice or other Senior Judge of the Supreme fœderal Court to be appointed by the Congress, and the Senior Judge of each State Court that now is or hereafter may be—all of whom shall be the Senior Judges for the time being, and ex officio be Judges of the said Court of Ariopagus at the time when the same shall be convened. And in any time hereafter if any state party to this Constitution, shall be of opinion that the Congress shall have enacted any law contrary to this Constitution, or that the Judiciary of Congress shall have exercised Jurisdiction in Cases not authorised by this Constitution—and the said state shall by vote of the Legislature thereof declare any such Law or Judiciary proceeding to be contrary to this Constitution, the said Legislature shall enter such upon their journals with their reasons for the same—and transmit the same to the President of Congress for the time being, who shall lay the same before the Legislature of the said Congress at their then next meeting, in order that the said Legislature may by law remove the grounds of the complaint of the said state. But if the Legislature of the Congress shall refuse or neglect so to do at their next session—and the State Legislature shall persevere in their opinion—In all such cases the said President of Congress shall, upon the address of such State Legislature, convene as soon as may be the said Court of Ariopagus, to be composed of the Senior Judges as aforementioned, if their health will admit of their attendance, but [1645]if not, then of the next Senior Judge who can attend, to be nominated by the President and the Executives of the several States respectively—which Court shall meet at the residence of Congress, and at such time as the President shall appoint—and after having taken an oath, or made affirmation, that they will faithfully and impartially decide upon the several points to them to be submitted as aforesaid, which oath shall be administered by the President or Vice President of Congress, and by him certified and entered upon the register of the said Court of Ariopagus—the said Court, or three fourths of the members thereof, who shall attend, shall have full power and authority to decide upon all such Acts of Congress and proceedings of the Judiciary of the United States, as shall have been submitted to their consideration in manner afore described, and confirm or annul the same as in their judgment shall seem right; and in all such cases where the same shall be annulled, full restitution shall forthwith be made to the State or States, party or parties, who have been aggrieved by the said Act of Congress, or Judiciary thereof.—Provided always, that a majority of the whole number of the Judges of the said Court of Ariopagus, shall concur in opinion before any such Law or Judiciary proceeding shall be annulled or reversed.—And the Judges of the said Court of Ario pagus shall receive for their services in attendance at the said Court, ______ pounds per diem, and also the further sum of ______ shillings per mile, for travelling to the said Court, with the like sum for returning, and no more.—And the said Court shall be dissolved so soon as the business before them, and to them submitted, as afore mentioned, shall be determined."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/18/1788,"When a change, so momentous in it’s nature, as that of new modelling a plan of government, becomes the object of any people’s meditation, every citizen, whose mind is duly impressed with a regard for the welfare of his country, will consider himself under an indispensible obligation to make some such enquiries, as the following.—Whence flows the necessity of a change?—Does it proceed from certain vicious properties, which reside in the old system and form the essential parts of it?—Or will such a measure become eligible, because evils have arisen from the feeble texture of the plan, or a loose exercise of government, [1646]which could not well be avoided?—What are the evils complained of? and what will be their correspondent remedies?—Are the evils radical, and not to be removed but by a general reform throughout the constitution?—Or do they result from a defect in some particular branch only? and may an adequate remedy be effected by introducing a new regulation merely as to that branch? If investigations like these are seriously and dispassionately pursued, and it should be found that the present confederation of the American states contains vicious properties, which are inherent, fundamental, and tending to produce a general corruption, the necessity of a change must then be manifest. This discovery will lead to another enquiry; and that is—Do such properties pervade the whole system and contaminate all the parts of it? If so—then a thorough change will appear to be expedient, and it may be necessary to new model the system. If, on the other hand, evils are found existing, which proceed, not so much from any internal corrupt qualities, as from the feeble texture of any parts of the system, or a laxity in the exercise of it’s powers, it should seem adviseable to make alterations so far as to add a due degree of strength to the weak parts, and thereby insure efficacy in the government. Should it appear, after a proper enquiry into the nature of the evils, that they are radical, and strike at the vital principles of the constitution—then to apply a correspondent remedy, an institution, which would produce a general reform, might with great propriety be deemed requisite. If the defects are of a trivial nature, and subsist merely in some particular department or branch of the system—then amendments in the defective branch, tending to give energy where it had hitherto been wanting, would be amply sufficient for removing the evils and forming a competent remedy. In order to discover how far the present system is vicious, or inadequate to the purposes of this great confederated society, for which it was established, a retrospect of the original design of the confederacy itself may afford no small degree of assistance.—Let it be recollected, then, that the primary object was to form a perfect union. This is manifested by the very “stile of the confederacy.”—That it was intended to promote justice equally between all the states cannot be doubted; because it is an institution, calculated to unite a number of independent republics under a firm league of amity, and to provide that contributions of every kind, which had been, or might be, necessary towards supporting their general government, should be furnished in due proportions [1647]—whilst it was stipulated that a mutual intercourse and reciprocal privileges and immunities should subsist between the citizens of all the several states. Again, to ensure domestic tranquility must have been another important object with the framers of this confederation: for union, harmony and justice cannot fail to promote tranquility; and whenever a contract is formed for the purpose of procuring the three first, it follows, as a regular consequence, that the other should partake of the intention.—This great association is expressly declared to be entered into between the states “for their common defence, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to, or attacks made upon, them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretence whatever.”2 The objects herein recited do certainly form the chief design of the present confederation; and the same are declared to be the great ends of the proposed plan of government. So far then do they agree. A subject of much contention, however, and with which the minds of different citizens are variously agitated, has arose. It has been said that some of these advantages, and of high import too, cannot be obtained under the present system. It is the opinion of some citizens that the constitution proposed to us will secure all these objects and form a complete remedy for every evil now subsisting; whilst it is asserted by others that amendments might be introduced in the former, which would be competent to every good purpose, and promote some of very great consequence, that might be endangered by an adoption of the latter. Thus it is inferred that this system extends too far—and, like many human institutions, flits by a rapid progress from one extreme to another. Those, who cannot approve of this plan, have very strong objections to it, because they apprehend that no security for their liberties will remain after it’s adoption: and although some of the ends proposed might be obtained thereby; yet they think the sacrifice will be too great for the benefit to be received. To enjoy a competent degree of liberty they consider as the greatest of human blessings—for the loss of which no acquisitions whatsoever can compensate. They esteem this (and deservedly too) as the soul of all political happiness. It seems to be agreed on all sides that in the present system of union the Congress are not invested with sufficient powers for regulating commerce, and procuring the requisite contributions for all expences, that may be incurred for the common defence or general welfare. Hence arise the principal defects;—and it is presumed that the evils resulting from [1648]these weak branches in the federal government might be adequately remedied by making due amendments merely therein. It is thought by some that the powers of making and enforcing the observance of treaties are not ample enough at present. If so—cannot these be enlarged so as to answer every desirable purpose of that branch in the federal institution? Thus, while many citizens cannot think that the confederation is fundamentally vicious, but that all the evils now complained of do rather proceed from a weakness in some of its parts, they apprehend no necessity for an innovation further than strengthening those parts. If such measures were effectually established, they conceive that all the great ends of the general government might be promoted.—No contention, therefore, subsists about supporting a union, but only concerning the mode; and as well those, who disapprove of the proposed plan, as those, who approve of it, consider the existence of a union as essential to their happiness.

Newspaper,No,Independent,,Virginia Gazette (Petersburg),,6/19/1788,"To the Honorable Convention, at Richmond. Gentlemen, You are now assembled on the most important occasion, and vested with the greatest power that perhaps any body of men have ever been from the foundation of the world to the present hour.—On your decision of the federal question, the glorious situation, or direful fate, of the present generation, and millions of millions yet unborn, both of the United States of America, and other inhabitants of the globe, will depend.—But in commisseration to your own descendants in particular, let me entreat you to make a pause.—I find that you are nearly divided upon the great point—Should you adopt the proposed Constitution, there will be about an equal proportion of joy and sorrow among your own members. But what does this avail, when a more alarming truth appears? namely—that a great majority of this Commonwealth is in the opposition, and must from portending causes be consigned to those bitter reflections which are the certain harbingers of misery and despair. What can you promise to yourselves from precipitating your country into a step that at present can answer no valuable purposes, but may, on the other hand, be attended with the deprivation of that darling liberty, in support of which such a host of heroes have bled and died? O! could they discover that the assignees of so great a blessing are at this moment stretching forth their hands in order at one throw to gambol away such a privilege, they would instantly break through the mansions of felicity, and resent the ingratitude! Is it the grand conventional prophecy, “that we could not exist six months longer without adopting the new Constitution” that has made you sore afraid? Happy for us, the period has some time ago elapsed, and previous to any transatlantic commotions; this at one view demonstrates, that amidst all their wisdom, the spirit of prophecy was not there;—And I will venture to predict, that six months longer, and six to that, will pass on before we shall be undone, agreeably to the prophecy aforesaid;—so that I presume our safety (if there were no other cause) will be guaranteed by those implements of death, that are dreadfully wielded by the Emperor of Germany and Empress of Russia, against the Turks, which, in all probability, will be productive of a general war throughout Europe. I shall now conclude by asking a plain question, viz. Can that mode of government be good, which so much divides the free and independent citizens of this Republic?—that sets at varience those who were [1656]bound by the closest ties of consanguinity—as brother against brother, and father against the son, &c—in consideration therefore, that this is the awful crisis of danger, I conjure you to withhold your hand from signing this horrible act, and let those nine states which, in the madness of their folly shall have executed the inglorious deed, have opportunity of repentance—Let them accede to, and admit such amendments as are generally agreed to, even by moderate federalists themselves, and then we will unite in one consolidated cause, and like friends and brothers strive to promote the happiness of all.—I have the happiness to be, what I hope ever to continue—INDEPENDENT. June 18, 1788."

This however he has recalled to day finding it would do their Cause Injury.32 The Republican Members of the Convention have appointed a Special Committee of Correspondence with the neighbouring Conventions &ca, of which the Honorable Judge Yates is Chairman— You will receive enclosed, and left open for your perusal a Letter from the Committee to Colo Mason Chairman of the Virginia Committee which is entrusted to your forwarding33—with whatever other Communications you and our other Friends in New York may think proper to make to that Quarter by such safe and expeditious mode of Conveyance as you may think expedient—The Letter to Colo Mason you will observe is put under Cover to Mr. George Flemming Merchant in Richmond as advised in Mr Masons Letter. The Committee have desired me to offer you their Thanks for your Attention and Care in forwarding the Information from Virginia, and request a Continuance of the Favor when any thing new and Important reaches you.

Inst, directed to John Lamb Esquire at Newyork Chairman of the federal Republican Committee in that City enclosing your proposed Amendments to the new Constitution, has been by him transmitted to such of the Members of our Convention, who are in Sentiment with him. In consequence of this Communication a Committee has been appointed by the Members in Opposition to the New System (of which they have appointed me their Chairman) with a special View to continue our Correspondence on this necessary and important Subject. We are happy to find that your Sentiments with respect to the Amendments correspond so nearly with ours, and that they stand on the Broad Basis of securing the Rights and equally promoting the Happiness of every Citizen in the Union.… We would willingly open a Correspondence with your Convention but the doubtful Chance of your obtaining a Majority—and the Possibility that we will compleat our Determinations before we could avail ourselves of your Advice, are the Reasons that we pursue the present Mode of Correspondence. You may rely on our fixed Determination that we shall not adopt the present Constitution without previous Amendments—We have had no Committee to draft Amendments, we therefore transmit you a Copy of those which many of us have agreed to.38 It is however possible upon farther Consideration that some of these may be modified or altered and others perhaps dropt."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,John Lamb,,,6/27/1788,"It is but this day I received the letter that you did me the honor to write to me on the 18th. of May last.40 Repeated experience having shewn me that 1 could not be at Richmond and be in health prevented [826]me from attempting to be a Member of our State Convention; but I have omitted no occasion of enforcing, to the utmost of my power, the propriety of so stating Amendments as to secure their adoption, as you will see by the letter I wrote to the president of our Convention, copy of which I have the honor to enclose to you.41 I lament that your letter did not reach me sooner, because I think your plan of correspondence would have produced salutary consequences; as it seems to have been the idea of our Assembly when they sent the proposed plan to a Convention. Every attempt has failed, either to get previous amendments or effectually to secure the obtaining them hereafter. Yet you will see Sir that the ratifying majority feel the propriety of amendments, altho, in my judgement, the mode they have pursued for obtaining them is neither wise or manly. But, if nothing better can be obtained in the States that have not yet ratified, even this Mode of expressing the sense of the approving states, may operate to the obtaining amendments hereafter, as well as to prevent in the exercise of power, such abuses as would, in all probability, take place. It will be considered, I believe, as a most extraordinary Epoch in the history of mankind, that in a few years there should be so essential a change in the minds of men. Tis realy astonishing that the same people who have just emerged from a long & cruel war in defence of liberty, should now agree to fix an elective despotism upon themselves & their posterity! It is true indeed, for the honor of human nature, that this has not been a general acquiescence—In respectable States there have been formidable Minorities—In this, a majority of ten only out of near 200 Members, neither demonstrates that a majority of the people approve the plan, nor does it augur well for the prosperity of the new government—Unless the wisdom & goodness of those who first act under this System shall lead them to take effectual measures for introducing the requisite amendments. And this 1 hope, for the honor and safety of the U. States, will be obtained by the mediation of wise and benevolent Men. Accept my thanks Sir for the enclosures, in your letter, which I shall read with great pleasure.42"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/28/1788,"Just departed this life in the bloom of Youth, our much admired and dearly beloved Friend CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY. He was a youth of uncommon vigor during his services in a military capacity, where his zeal for the United States was not surpassed by any of his brother officers—he sustained during a bloody conflict of a desperate siege (for eight years,) his post of honor with a firmness that was never equaled by the oldest veteran so far from shutting himself up in a small (compass or) garrison, he encreased and enlarged the boundaries of the camp, where the soldiers might enjoy all the pleasures of domestic society, without weakening or losing one atom of his authority; the innocent recreations and friendly gambols of his faithful followers, were not restrained, even when he was on a line of march; and his orders were executed and obeyed with reverence and esteem, his aid[e]s were wise and discreet, and never executed any authority without engaging the accompanyment of two favorite subalterns, love and affection—In fine, all his marches, counter marches, and manœvers, delighted the whole camp; his discipline dazzled and [1692]confounded his enemies, and his sorties have been so dreadful as to make the British Lion tremble at his feet:—His whole army were defended by redoubts, fortresses, bastions, counterscarps, batteries, fosses, ravellins, pickets, &c. &c—All the neighbouring powers respected and loved him courted his friendship and alliance;—thus situated the reciprocation of good offices were the first thought of his soul, but, communicating his plan of defence to some of the adjoining confederacies, where he necessarily shew’d the plat of his whole encampment, they found a weak part therein; they like apparent friends, sent him a message to the following purport.—“We your brethren in one common cause, embarked have been sensible of the hardships of the war, in which you have sustained so great a part, we in sympathy to your distress, and by the ties of our federal articles, now propose to send as auxilliaries, some of our choicest disciplined officers and soldiers, to command your out posts,[”] which were defended with some of the most valuable brass ordinance, he gladly opened the gates and received this supposed additional strength, having been on double duty for some time; no sooner had the auxilliaries the management of his out posts and some batteries, within his lines, but they began to assume an equal command, and the disorderly behavior of a few of both soldiers and officers, plainly shew’d him their bad designs; in vain did he remonstrate against their licentious behavior, in vain did he wish to get rid of them;—a skirmish ensued in which he received several wounds, though none of them were thought to be mortal, the engagement at last became general and one of the principal batteries revolted and declared against him:—The battle now became more terrible than ever, the enemy (already dreadful with their musquetry) now turned their cannon on him, no less than 89 heavy brass pieces2 incessantly playing upon his flanks and center, nor day nor night was the horrid din of arms less incessant; twenty two days in the list of time3 did he defend his rights with that fortitude and becoming dignity that marked his exalted soul; all the cannon in his whole park of artillery was dismounted or rendered useless, his ammunition on the point of giving out, forced him to surrender himself upon these sad terms, not prisoner of war but prisoner at discretion! Such a reverse of fortune, brought about by his professed friends and allies, drove him into despair. In vain did the state physicians, prescribe a strict regimen; in vain did they prohibit patent medicines, and G. W’s. circular prescription;4 in vain did they exhort him not to listen to a great quack, who wore a white coat; in vain I say was every anodyne administered, for fell despair had opened the bleeding wounds he had received afresh, and gave the grave the fairest portion [1693]of independent excellence, that ever tread the theatre of this capacious stage. Reader whoever thou art, drop a tear of pity on his ashes; let his remembrance be sacred in your grateful lays, let his dead corpse be placed before your eyes: let recollection tear his manes from the devoted tomb! and fix your steady purpose to revenge his cause! the cause of Heaven committed to your charge! He was inter[r]ed in a manner suitable to his rank, but without the discharge of artillery that being forbid by his will, which is recorded in the large volume of Fame, and witnessed by 79 of his brother officers.5 Despondent anguish, pity, rage, terror, fury, working in the fettered soul, but faintly showed the affecting aera, and but faintly told that all was lost. EPITAPH, Here lies the blessed body of our CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY in hopes of a glorious resurrection. FUNERAL PROCESSION, The corps[e] preceded by all the patriots in the city—Public integrity, Virtue, Friendship, and every domestic smile. PALL BEARERS, The four great Pillars of the state, viz: Liberty of the Press—Liberty of Conscience. Taxation with representation—Trial by jury.

Letter,Yes,Caleb Wallace,William Fleming,,,6/29/1788,"… I am impatient to hear from our Convention at Richmond. I am not better pleased with the New Federal Constitution than when I wrote to you on the subject;2 but I am much better reconciled to [1695]its adoption on account of the dangers the Union is exposed to from the greater imperfections of the old one. Of two evils I woud choose the least If neither can be avoided.…"
Newspaper,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,7/2/1788,"Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Richmond to his friend in this city, dated 25th June, 1788. “I inform you that this day the new constitution was adopted by a majority of eight, the whole number being 168. The opposition appear content, at least they say so. The inhabitants of the town are either [1698]wise enough, or polite enough, to make no procession or other parade. The convention are to meet again to-morrow, when the last final fiat will be given to the business. In all the stages of the business I have been an opponent, but being out voted, or defeated, I submit cheerfully, and will give every support to the system which I can, until I find errors like to take place. Mr. Henry has been powerful, but now appears to be content. I suppose you will have some pompous eulogium from some person or other, whose mind is elevated on this occasion.”"
Letter,Yes,William Nelson Jr., William Short,,,7/12/1788,"My dear Short … As to politics, you say a few frigates wd. answer the purpose of coercion better than a standing army—Should N. Carolina be punished [1701]for the delinquence of Virginia?—The non-importing states, by this system, wd. be involved in the fate of the importing states, if the latter deserve, or are supposed to deserve, chastisement—If any dispute of this kind shd. arise between a state & the united body, the efficacy preference of these schemes will probably be tried, as ten states have ratified the new government. New Hampshire was the ninth in succession & this state the tenth—When the convention of this state acceded to it, the members thought she was the ninth, the account from New Hampshire having arrived since. I inclose you the form of the ratification.—You will observe prefixed to it, a preamble which, the opponents of the government consider as a previous declaration of rights—exclusive of this, there is recommended a bill of rights, with seperate amendments. If these, or the most important of them, shd. be engrafted, I think the mode of trying the president may be esteemed almost the only defect remaining in it. Yet there are many of them which, I am persuaded will be lost.—My darling amendment “that no person shall be elected capable of serving as president more than eight years in any term of sixteen,”2 I feel great anxiety for. On this subject, in my last, I was guilty of an historical error. I mentioned the doge of Venice as in fact hereditary3—On examination, I find myself mistaken—The history of that government, however, furnishes a proof of the dangerous influence of an aristocracy over the people—The people once elected the doge—the senate now elect him, & present him to the people for the shew of their approbation. Thus did the military of Rome act towards the senate—Our circumstances are somewhat unlike, & we have not that aristocracy, nor this army, but I am not sure that some have not the disposition to it, & that power will not create the one, whilst the numerous & open defenders of a standing army the other, even in time of peace, by no means give cause to banish suspicion apprehension upon that subject.—Mr. Henry, with great talents & address, &, I verily believe, with views really friendly to liberty, stood forth, the opponent of the constitution—He was indefatigable, & more & more able day by day, for near three weeks, the convention continuing within one day of that term, & at last, when he discovered that there wd. be a majority agt him (tho’ a small one) declared that “as far as he had influence there shd be good order.”4—Mr. Mason is said not to have behaved with so much temper. The other speakers in the opposition were Mr. Tyler, Monroe, Grayson & Mr. Dawson.—Those in favor of the government, Mr. Madison, the Governour (who was very strenuous) Mr. G Nicholas, Innes, Z. Johnson, Marshall[,] Corbin, Colo H Lee, & Mr. Pendleton, who you will observe was the president. Mr. Wythe was silent except, when he brt. in the amendments.5—I have mentioned the names as I recollected [1702]them. They had certainly the weight of talents. What must the individual be who cd. thus oppose them united? I did not hear him, not being at all at the convention—I confess I am not fond of his oratory in general; but on this occasion I shd. have been much gratified by hearing him—I wished extremely also to have heard Madison & Innes—By the unanimous voice of all whom I have heard speak on the subject, except one coxcomb, who did not like Madison,—they were astonishingly great in their respective ways—Innes spoke but once, & that was almost at the close of the business—Nicholas shewed himself to be very able, & was thought more equal to answering Henry, than any other person—Z Johnson surprized every body, altho’ every body knew him to be very sensible & clear-headed. Indeed, I heard a man of judgement declare, that Johnson’s speech was the best which was delivered in the convention—Marshall’s perspicuity & force were greater than ever—These accounts I have universally heard from those, whom I have seen from the convention—I have heard various opinions as to the Governor, Corbin, & H Lee.… I lament the opportunity, which Ternant6 lost of distinguishing himself, & weep over the corpse of dying republicanism. Yet, if some or all of the amendments, which this state has proposed to the new constitution, or some of the most important, be adopted, she may be recovered.—This, however, scarcely can be hoped. That, which limits the continuance of the president is recommended only by this state—In some others of consequence Massachusets & S Carolina unite with us.—You say “when the patient will not take desperate remedies, he is in extreme danger.[”] Now I think, if he fancies himself in extreme danger, he will take desperate remedies. The adoption of the new government is a case in point. The votes were 85 for & 75 against, the measure. Notwithstanding this small majority, the minority declare their determination to acquiesce, & use their influence with the people to promote it.—No commotions are apprehended, unless any abuses should take place. If such a disposition would otherwise have prevailed, the respectableness of the minority will curb it, as there was a majority of only 9 in Massachusetts, of 10 in this state & 10 in New hampshire.… As to the state of our courts, the judges of the court of appeals at their last session drew up a very bold & sensible remonstrance to the legislature on the subject of the district court-law7—They declare that it is unconstitutional in calling on the judges of the Chancery & Admiralty to do the duty of common-law judges, & in directing the judges of the genl. court to perform additional duties without adding to their salaries. That the judiciary are independent of the legislature, that to increase duties without increasing the compensation is so far [1703]a diminution of salary, & tends to destroy their independence—That all laws which have been made on this subject, since the first, are unconstitutional.—That, however, from the particular circumstances of the country they have acquiesced in them hitherto, this they consider as a direct attack on their independence—As to the mixed jurisdiction of the court of appeals, which they have exercised, this they justify from the necessity of the thing, as it must be the case, wherever there exists one dernier resort from all the courts.—They conclude by refusing to execute the law, & respectfully remonstrating to the assembly, declaring, if it shd. be necessary, that they will appeal to the People. As the operation of the law was to have begun on the 1st. of this month, it became necessary to call the assembly—The 23d. was the day appointed for their meeting. They did not proceed on business untill the convention rose, as many were members of both bodies. They appointed Colo. Matthews their speaker. Grayson was within five or six votes. They defer’d the operation of the district-law, the members being anxious to return to Harvest—The subject will be taken up in the fall.—I thought it necessary to give you this information, least my last letter shd. bring you over in expectation of a new field opening by the operation [of] this act.—The genl. court-business declines. Whether from the state of uncertainty as to our system, I know not. Altho’ this prospect is shut for a time, a much brighter one unfolds itself to our profession at the dawn of the new-constitution—As a lawyer, I always, liked it; tho’ as a citizen I was averse to it— The resources of future delight, which you are now drawing from the Lycee, will no doubt hereafter afford you the most refined & deep satisfaction. But when you come to America; with less disposition than you seem to have for domestick life, you wd. find a matrimonial connection necessary:—unless indeed the splendid government, wch. we are to have, shd. furnish fresh objects of attention, more captivating & productive of real happiness in their pursuit, than have been known to us hitherto—But enough of this.…"
Letter,No,James Monroe,Thomas Jefferson,,,7/12/1788,"Altho’ I am persuaded you will have received the proceedings of our convention upon the plan of government submitted from Phila. yet as it is possible this may reach you sooner than other communications I herewith inclose a copy to you. They terminated as you will find in a ratification which must be consider’d, so far as a reservation of certain rights go, as conditional, with the recommendation of subsequent amendments. The copy will designate to you the part which different gentn. took upon this very interesting & important subject. The detail in the managment of the business, from your intimate knowledge of characters, you perhaps possess, with great accuracy, without a formal narration of it. <Pendleton tho much impaired in health and in every respect in the decline of life shewed as much zeal to carry it, as if he had been a young man. Perhaps more than he discover’d in the commencment of the late revolution in his opposition to G. Britain.2 Wythe acted as chairman to the committee of the whole and of course took but little part in the debate, but was for the adoption relying on subsequent amendments. Blair said nothing, but was for it. the Governor exhibited a curious spectacle to view: having refused to sign the paper every body supposed him against it. But he afterwards had writen a letter3 & having taken a part which might be called rather vehement than active he was constantly labouring to shew that his present conduct [was] consistent with that letter & the letter with his refusal to sign: Madison took the principal share in the debate for it. In which together with the aid I have already mention’d he was somewhat assisted by Innes, H. Lee Marshal Corbin & G. Nicholas as Mason Henry & Grayson were the principal Supporters of the opposition. The discussion as might have been expected where the parties were so nearly on a balance, was conducted generally with great order, propriety & respect of either party to the other>—and [1705]its event was accompanied with no circumstance on the part of the victorious that mark extra[ordinar]y exultation, nor of depression on the part of the unfortunate. There was no bonfire illumination &ca and had there been I am inclin’d to believe, the opposition would have not only express’d no dissatisfaction, but have scarcely felt any at it, for they seemed to be govd. by principles elevated highly above circumstances so trivial & transitory in their nature. The conduct of Genl. Washington upon this occasion has no doubt been right and meritorious all parties had acknowledged defects in the federal system, and been sensible of the propriety of some material change. To forsake the honourable retreat to which he had retired & risque the reputation he had so deservedly acquir’d, manifested a zeal for the publick interest, that could after so many and illustrious services, & at this stage of his life, scarcely have been expected from him. Having however commenc’d again on the public theatre the course which he takes becomes not only highly interesting to him but like wise so to us: The human character is not perfect; and if he partakes of those qualities—which we have too much reason to believe are almost inseparable from the frail nature of our being the people of America will perhaps be lost: be assured his influence carried this government; for my own part I have a boundless confidence in him nor have I any reason to beleive he will ever furnish occasion for withdrawing it. More is to be apprehended if he takes a part in the public councils again as he advances in age from the designs of those around him than from any dispositions of his own. In the discussion of the subject an allusion was made I believe in the first instance, by Mr. Henry to an opinion you had given on this subject, in a letter to Mr. Donald.4 This afterwards became the subject of much inquiry & debate in the house, as to the construction of the contents of such letter & I was happy to find the great attention & universal respect with which the opinion was treated; as well as the great regard and high estimation in which the author of it was [held?]. It must be painful to have been thus made a party in this transaction but this must have been alleviated by a consideration of the circumstances I have mention’d. From the fi[rst?] view I had of the report from Phila. I had some strong obje[ctions to it—but as I had no?] inclination to inlist myself on either side made no communication or positive declaration of my sentiments untill after the Convention met—being however desirous to communicate them to my constituents I address’d the enclos’d letter to them, with intention of giving them a view thereof eight or ten days before it met; but the impression was delayed so long, & so incorrectly made, and the whole performance upon reexamination so loosely [1706]drawn that I thought it best to suppress it. There appear’d likewise to be an impropriety in interfering with the subject in that manner in that late stage of the business. I enclose it you for your perusal & comment on it.5 You have no doubt been apprized of the remonstrance of the Judges to the proceedings of the Legislature in the passage particularly of the district court law, as likewise of its contents—The subject will be taken up in the fall—The legislature altho assembled for the purpose declin’d entering into it, because of the season of the year being anxious to get home about their harvest. For this purpose they passd an act suspending the operation of the district court law untill sometime in Decr. or Jany next. Altho different modifications may be made of it yet I think the bill will be retained in its principal features.6 I still reside here and perhaps shall continue to do so whilst I remain at the bar, especially if the district court law holds its ground. I hold a seat in the legislature & believe I shall do it for some time. The absence from my family is painful but I must endeavor to have them with me as much as possible. I hope you enjoy your health well. I have heard nothing to the contrary. I hope also that Miss Patsy & Molly7 are well. Short I likewise hope is in health. Remember me to them & believe me most affectionately your friend & servant—"
