Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Elbridge Gerry,,,9/29/1787,"According to your request I now enclose you the Amendments that I proposed to the new Constitution. I incline to think, that unless some such alterations & provisions as those are interposed for the security of those essential rights of Mankind, without which liberty can not exist, we shall soon find that the New plan of Government will be far more inconvenient than any thing sustained under the present Government. And that to avoid Scilla we shall have fallen upon Caribdis."
Letter,Yes,Richard Henry Lee,George Mason,,,10/1/1787,"I have waited until now to answer your favor of September 18th10 from Philadelphia, that I might inform you how the Convention plan of government was entertained by Congress. Your prediction of what would happen in Congress was exactly verified. It was with us, as with you, this or nothing; and this urged with a most extreme intemperance. The greatness of the powers given and the multitude of places to be created produces a coalition of monarchy men, military men, aristocrats, and drones whose noise, impudence and zeal exceeds all belief—whilst the commercial plunder of the South stimulates the rapacious trader. In this state of things, the patriot voice is raised in vain for such changes and securities as reason and experience prove to be necessary against the encroachments of power upon the indispensable rights of human nature. Upon due consideration of the Constitution under which we now act, some of us were clearly of opinion that the 13th Article of the Confederation precluded us from giving an opinion concerning a plan subversive of the present system and eventually forming a new confederacy of nine instead of 13 states. The contrary doctrine was asserted with great violence in expectation of the strong majority with which they might send it forward under terms of much approbation. Having procured an opinion that Congress was qualified to consider, to amend, to approve or disapprove, the next game was to determine that tho a right to amend existed, it would be highly inexpedient to exercise that right; but merely to transmit it with respectful marks of approbation. In this state of things I availed myself of the right to amend and moved the amendments, a copy of which I send herewith, and called the ayes and nays to fix them on the Journal. This greatly alarmed the majority and vexed them extremely, for the plan is to push the business on with great dispatch and with as little opposition as possible; that it may be adopted before it has stood the test of reflection and due examination. They found it most eligible at last to transmit it merely, without approving or disapproving; provided nothing but the transmission should appear on the Journal. This compromise was settled and they took the opportunity of inserting the word “unanimously,” which applied only to simple transmission, hoping to have it mistaken for an unanimous approbation of the thing. It states that Congress having received the Constitution unanimously transmit it, etc. It is certain that no approbation was given."
Letter,Yes,Richard Henry Lee,William Shippen Jr.,,,10/2/1787,"I have considered the new Constitution with all the attention and candor that the thing and the times render necessary, and I find it impossible for me to doubt, that in its present state, unamended, the adoption of it will put civil liberty and the happiness of the people at the mercy of rulers who may possess the great unguarded powers given. And I assure you that confidence in the moderation or benignity of power is not a plant of quick growth in a reflecting bosom. The necessary alterations will by no means interfere with the general nature of the plan, or limit the power of doing good; but they will restrain from oppression the wicked and tyrannic. If all men were wise and good there would be no necessity for government or law. But the folly and the vice of human nature renders government and laws necessary for the many, and restraints indispensable to prevent oppression from those who are entrusted with the administration of one and the dispensation of the other. You will see herewith the amendments that appeared to me necessary.12 They are submitted to you and my excellent old friend at Germantown. Perhaps they may be submitted to the world at large. My good old friend has made himself better acquainted with Hippocrates than with Plato, and relying upon the goodness of his own heart, without reflecting upon the corrupting and encroaching nature of power, he is willing to trust to its fangs more than experience justifies. The malady of human nature in these states now seems to be as it was in the years of 1778 and 1779 with respect to the effect produced by a certain combination. The malady that I mean is a temporary insanity. I wish that the present may subside with as little public injury as it formerly did, altho that was not small in all its branches."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Samuel Adams,,,10/5/1787,"Having long toiled with you my dear friend in the Vineyard of liberty, I do with great pleasure submit to your wisdom and patriotism, the objections that prevail in my mind against the new Constitution proposed for federal government—Which objections I did propose to Congress in form of amendments to be discussed, and that such as were approved might be forwarded to the States with the Convention system. You will have been informed by other hands why these amendments were not considered and do not appear on the Journal, and the reasons that influenced a bare transmission of the Convention plan, without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation on the part of Congress.2 I [37]suppose my dear Sir, that the good people of the U. States in their late generous contest, contended for free government in the fullest, clearest, and strongest sense. That they had no idea of being brought under despotic rule under the notion of “Strong government,” or in form of elective despotism: Chains being still Chains, whether made of gold or of iron. The corrupting nature of power, and its insatiable appetite for increase, hath proved the necessity, and procured the adoption of the strongest and most express declarations of that Residuum of natural rights, which is not intended to be given up to Society; and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose. In a government therefore, where the power of judging what shall be for the general wellfare, which goes to every object of human legislation; and where the laws of such Judges shall be the supreme Law of the Land: it seems to be of the last consequence to declare in most explicit terms the reservations above alluded to. So much for the propriety of a Bill of Rights as a necessary bottom to this new system—It is in vain to say that the defects in this new Constitution may be remedied by the Legislature created by it. The remedy, as it may, as it may not be applied—And if it should, a subsequent Assembly may repeal the Acts of its predecessor for the parliamentary doctrine is ‘quod legis posteriores priores contrarias abrogant’ 4 Inst. 43.3 Surely this is not a ground upon which a wise and good man would choose to rest the dearest rights of human nature—Indeed, some capital defects are not within the compass of legislative redress—The Oligarchic tendency from the combination of President, V. President, & Senate, is a ruin not within legislative remedy. Nor is the partial right of voting in the Senate, or the defective numbers in the house of Representatives. It is of little consequence to say that the numbers in the last mentioned Assembly will increase with the population of these States, because what may happen in twenty five or 27 years hence is poor alleviation of evil, that the intermediate time is big with; for it often happens that abuse under the name of Use is rivetted upon Mankind. Nor can a good reason be assigned for establishing a bad, instead of a good government, in the first instance; because time may amend the bad-Men do not choose to be sick because it may happen that physic may cure them—Suppose that good men came first to the administration of this government; and that they should see, or think they see, a necessity for trying criminally a Man without giving him his Jury of the Vicinage; or that the freedom of the Press should be restrained because it disturbed the operations of the new government—the mutilation of the jury trial, and the restraint of the Press would then [38]follow for good purposes as it should seem, and by good men—But these precedents will be followed by bad men to sacrifice honest and innocent men; and to suppress the exertions of the Press for wicked and tyrannic purposes—it being certainly true that ‘Omnia mala exempla ex bonis orta sunt: sed ubi imperium ad ignaros aut minus bonos pervinit, novum illud exemplum ab dignis et idoneis ad indignos et non idoneous fertur.’4 In proof of this, we know that the wise and good Lord Holt, to support King William and Revolution principles, produced doctrines in a case of Libel (King against Bear) subversive both of law and sound sense; which his Successor Lord Mannsfield (in the case of Woodfall) would have availed himself of for the restraint of the Press and the ruin of liberty.5 It would appear therefore, that the consideration of human perversity renders it necessary for human safety, that in the first place, power not requisite should not be given, and in the next place that necessary powers should be carefully guarded. How far this is done in the New Constitution I submit to your wise and attentive consideration. Whether, for the present, it may not be sufficient so to alter the Confederation as to allow Congress full liberty to make Treaties by removing the restraining clauses;6 by giving the Impost for a limited time, and the power of Regulating trade; is a question that deserves to be considered. But I think the new Constitution (properly amended) as it contains many good regulations, may be admitted—And why may not such indispensable amendments be proposed by the Conventions and returned With the new plan to Congress that a new general Convention may so weave them into the proffer’d system as that a Web may be produced fit for freemen to wear? If such amendments were proposed by a Capital state or two, & a willingness expressed to agree with the plan so amended; I cannot see why it may not be effected. It is a mere begging the question to suppose, as some do, that only this Moment and this Measure will do—But why so, there being no war external or internal to prevent due deliberation on this most momentous business—The public papers will inform you what violence has been practised by the Agitators of this new System in Philadelphia to drive on its immediate adoption—As if the subject of Government were a business of passion, instead of cool, sober, and intense consideration.7 I shall not leave this place before the 4th of November—in the mean time I shall be happy to hear from you—My best compliments are presented to Mrs. Adams, and I pray to be remembered to Gen. [James] Warren, Mr. [James] Lovell & the good Doctor [Samuel] Holten when you see him."
Letter,No,George Mason,George Washington,,,10/7/1787,"I got very much hurt in my Neck & Head, by the unlucky Accident on the Road; it is now wearing off; tho’ at times still uneasy to me.2— I take the Liberty to enclose You my Objections to the new Constitution of Government; which a little Moderation & Temper, in the latter End of the Convention, might have removed. I am however most decidedly of Opinion, that it ought to be submitted to a Convention chosen by the People, for that special Purpose; and should any Attempt be made to prevent the calling such a Convention here, such a Measure shall have every Opposition in my Power to give it3—You will readily observe, that my Objections are not numerous (the greater Part of the inclosed paper containing Reasonings upon the probable Effects of the exceptionable Parts) tho’ in my Mind, some of them are capital ones.— There is no Declaration of Rights; and the Laws of the general Government being paramount to the Laws & Constitutions of the several States, the Declarations of Rights in the separate States are no Security. Nor are the People secured even in the Enjoyment of the Benefits of the common-Law; (which stands here upon no other Foundation than it’s having been adopted by the respective Acts forming the Constitutions of the several States.—) In the House of Representatives there is not the Substance, but the Shadow only of Representation; which can never produce proper Information in the Legislature, or inspire Confidence in the People: the Laws will therefore be generally made by Men little concern’d in, and unacquainted with their Effects & Consequences.—(a) The Senate have the Power of altering all Money-Bills, and of originating Appropriations of Money, & the sallerys of the Officers of their own Appointment in Conjunction with the President of the United States; altho’ they are not the Representatives of the People, or amenable to them.— These with their other great Powers (vizt. their Power in the Appointment of Ambassadors & all public Officers, in making Treaties, & in trying all Impeachments) their Influence upon & Connection with the supreme Executive from these Causes, their Duration of Office, and their being a constant existing Body almost continually sitting, [44]join’d with their being one compleat Branch of the Legislature, will destroy any Balance in the Government, and enable them to accomplish what Usurpations they please upon the Rights & Libertys of the People.— The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed & extended, as to absorb & destroy the Judiciarys of the several States; thereby rendering Law as tedious intricate & expensive, and Justice as unattainable, by a great Part of the Community, as in England, and enabling the Rich to oppress & ruin the Poor.— The President of the United States has no constitutional Council (a thing unknown in any safe & regular Government) he will therefore be unsupported by proper Information & Advice; and will generally be directed by Minions & Favourites—or He will become a Tool to the Senate—or a Council of State will grow out of the principal Officers of the great Departments; the worst & most dangerous of all Ingredients for such a Council, in a free Country; <for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive Measures, to shelter themselves and prevent an Inquiry into their own Misconduct in Office; whereas had a constitutional Council been formed (as was proposed) of six Members; vizt. two from the Eastern, two from the Middle, and two from the Southern States, to be appointed by Vote of the States in the House of Representatives, with the same Duration & Rotation of Office as the Senate, the Executive would always have had safe & proper Information & Advice, the President of such a Council might have acted as Vice President of the United States, pro tempore, upon any Vacancy or Disability of the chief Magistrate; and long continued Sessions of the Senate would in a great Measure have been prevented.—> From this fatal Defect of a constitutional Council has arisen the improper Power of the Senate, in the Appointment of public Officers, and the alarming Dependence & Connection between that Branch of the Legislature, and the supreme Executive.—Hence also sprung that unnecessary & dangerous Officer the Vice President; who for want of other Employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously blending the executive & legislative Powers; besides always giving to some one of the States an unnecessary & unjust Pre-eminence over the others.— The President of the United States has the unrestrained Power of granting Pardons for Treason; which may be sometimes excercised to screen from Punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the Crime, & thereby prevent a Discovery of his own Guilt.— By declaring all Treaties supreme Laws of the Land, the Executive [45]& the Senate have, in many Cases, an exclusive Power of Legislation; which might have been avoided, by proper Distinctions with Respect to Treaties, and requiring the Assent of the House of Representatives, where it could be done with Safety.— By requiring only a Majority to make all Commercial & Navigation Laws, the five Southern States (whose Produce & Circumstances are totally different from that of the eight Northern & Eastern States) will be ruined; for such rigid & premature Regulations may be made as will enable the Merchants of the Northern & Eastern States not only to demand an exorbitant Freight, but to monopolize the Purchase of the Commodities at their own Price, for many Years: to the great Injury of the landed Interest, & Impoverishment of the People: and the Danger is the greater, as the Gain on one Side will be in Proportion to the Loss on the other. Whereas requiring two thirds of the Members present in both Houses would have produced mutual Moderation, promoted the general Interest, and removed an insuperable Objection to the Adoption of the Government.— Under their own Construction of the general Clause at the End of the enumerated Powers, the Congress may grant Monopolies in Trade & Commerce, constitute new Crimes, inflict unusual & severe Punishments, and extend their Power as far as they shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no Security for the Powers now presumed to remain to them; or the People for their Rights.— There is no Declaration of any kind for preserving the Liberty of the Press, the Tryal by jury in civil Causes; nor against the Danger of standing Armys in time of Peace. The State Legislatures are restrained from laying Export-Duties on their own Produce.— The general Legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further Importation of Slaves for twenty odd Years; tho’ such Importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable, and less capable of Defence.— Both the general Legislature & the State Legislatures are expressly prohibited making ex post facto Laws; tho’ there never was or can be a Legislature but must & will make such Laws, when Necessity & the public Safety require them; which will hereafter be a Breach of all the Constitutions in the Union, and afford Precedents for other Innovations.— This Government will commence in a moderate Aristocracy; it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in it’s Operation, produce a Monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive Aristocracy; it will most probably [46]vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other.— (a)This Objection has been in some Degree lessened by an Amendment, often before refused, and at last made by an Erasure, after the Engrossment upon Parchment, of the word forty, and inserting thirty, in the 3d. Clause of the 2d. Section of the 1st. Article.—"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,George Washington,,,10/11/1787,"It is under the strongest impressions of your goodness and candor, that I venture to make the observations that follow in this letter, assuring you that I feel it among the first distresses that have happened to me in my life, that I find myself compelled by irresistible conviction of mind to doubt about the new System for federal government recommended by the late Convention. It is Sir, in consequence of long reflection upon the nature of Man and of government, that I am led to fear the danger that will ensue to Civil Liberty, from the adoption of the new system in its present form. I am fully sensible of the propriety of change in the present plan of confederation, and altho there may be difficulties, not inconsiderable, in procuring an adoption of such amendments to the Convention System as will give security to the just rights of human nature, and better secure from injury the discordant interests of the different parts of this Union; yet I hope that these difficulties are not insurmountable. Because we are happily uninterrupted by external war, or by such internal discords as can prevent peaceable and fair discussion, in another Convention, of those objections that are fundamentally strong against the new Constitution, which abounds with useful regulations. As there is so great a part of the business well done already, I think that such alterations as must give very general content, could not long employ another Convention when provided with the sense of the different States upon those alterations. I am much inclined to believe that the amendments generally thought to be necessary, will be found to be of such a nature, as tho they do not oppose the exercise of a very competent federal power; are yet such as the best Theories on Government and the best practise upon those theories have found necessary. At the same time that they are [52]such as the opinions of our people have for ages been fixed on. It would be unnecessary for me here to enumerate particulars as I expect the honor of waiting on you at Mount Vernon in my way home early in November.2"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Edmund Randolph,,,10/16/1787,"Dear Sir, I was duly honored with your favor of September 17th,1 from Philadelphia, which should have been acknowledged long before now, if the nature of the business that it related to had not required time. The establishment of the new plan of government, in its present form, is a question that involves such immense consequences to the present times and to posterity, that it calls for the deepest attention of the best and wisest friends of their country and of mankind. If it be found good after mature deliberation, adopt it, if wrong, amend it at all events, for to say (as many do) that a bad government must be established for fear of anarchy, is really saying that we must kill ourselves for fear of dying. Experience and the actual state of things, shew that there is no difficulty in procuring a general convention; the late one being collected without any obstruction: Nor does external war, or internal discord prevent the most cool, collected, full, and fair discussion of this all-important subject. If with infinite ease, a convention was obtained to prepare a system, why may not another with equal ease be procured to make proper and necessary amendments? Good government is not the work of a short time, or of sudden thought. From Moses to Montesquieu the greatest geniuses have been employed on this difficult subject, and yet experience has shewn capital defects in the system produced for the government of mankind. But since it is neither prudent or easy to make frequent changes in government, and as bad governments have been generally found the most fixed; so it becomes of the last consequence to frame the first establishment upon ground the most unexceptionable, and such as the best theories with experience justify; not trusting as our new constitution does, and as many approve of doing, to time and future events to correct errors, that both reason and experience in similar cases, point out in the new system. It has hitherto been supposed a fundamental maxim that in governments rightly balanced, the different branches of legislature should be unconnected, and that the legislative and executive powers should be separate:—In the new constitution, the president and senate have all the executive and two thirds of the legislative power. In some weighty instances (as making all kinds of treaties which are to be the laws of the land) they have the whole legislative and executive powers. They jointly, appoint all officers civil and military, and they (the senate) [62]try all impeachments either of their own members, or of the officers appointed by themselves. Is there not a most formidable combination of power thus created in a few, and can the most critic eye, if a candid one, discover responsibility in this potent corps? Or will any sensible man say, that great power without responsibility can be given to rulers with safety to liberty? It is most clear that the parade of impeachment is nothing to them or any of them—as little restraint is to be found, I presume from the fear of offending constituents.—The president is for four years duration (and Virginia for example) has one vote of thirteen in the choice of him, and this thirteenth vote not of the people, but electors, two removes from the people. The senate is a body of six years duration, and as in the choice of president, the largest state has but a thirteenth vote, so is it in the choice of senators.—This latter statement is adduced to shew that responsibility is as little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from the terror of impeachment. You are, therefore, Sir, well warranted in saying, either a monarchy or aristocracy will be generated, perhaps the most grievous system of government may arise. It cannot be denied with truth, that this new constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously oligarchic; and it is a point agreed that a government of the few, is, of all governments, the worst. The only check to be found in favor of the democratic principle in this system is, the house of representatives; which I believe may justly be called a mere shread or rag of representation: It being obvious to the least examination, that smallness of number and great comparative disparity of power, renders that house of little effect to promote good, or restrain bad government. But what is the power given to this ill constructed body? To judge of what may be for the general welfare, and such judgments when made, the acts of Congress become the supreme laws of the land. This seems a power co-extensive with every possible object of human legislation.—Yet there is no restraint in form of a bill of rights, to secure (what Doctor Blackstone calls) that residuum of human rights, which is not intended to be given up to society, and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose.2—The rights of conscience, the freedom of the press, and the trial by jury are at mercy. It is there stated, that in criminal cases, the trial shall be by jury. But how? In the state. What then becomes of the jury of the vicinage or at least from the county in the first instance, for the states being from 50 to 700 miles in extent? This mode of trial even in criminal cases may be greatly impaired, and in civil causes the inference is strong, that it may be altogether omitted as the constitution positively assumes it in criminal, [63]and is silent about it in civil causes.—Nay, it is more strongly discountenanced in civil cases by giving the supreme court in appeals, jurisdiction both as to law and fact. Judge Blackstone in his learned commentaries, art. jury trial, says, it is the most transcendant privilege which any subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, his person, but by the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals.3 A constitution that I may venture to affirm has under providence, secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages.—The impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society. But if that be entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince, or such as enjoy the highest offices of the state, these decisions in spite of their own natural integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity. It is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should always be attentive to the good of the many. The learned judge further says, that every tribunal selected for the decision of facts, is a step towards establishing aristocracy; the most oppressive of all governments.4 The answer to these objections is, that the new legislature may provide remedies!—But as they may, so they may not, and if they did, a succeeding assembly may repeal the provisions.—The evil is found resting upon constitutional bottom, and the remedy upon the mutable ground of legislation, revocable at any annual meeting. It is the more unfortunate that this great security of human rights, the trial by jury, should be weakened in this system, as power is unnecessarily given in the second section of the third article, to call people from their own country in all cases of controversy about property between citizens of different states and foreigners, with citizens of the United States, to be tried in a distant court where the Congress may sit. For although inferior congressional courts may for the above purposes be instituted in the different states, yet this is a matter altogether in the pleasure of the new legislature, so that if they please not to institute them, or if they do not regulate the right of appeal reasonably, the people will be exposed to endless oppression, and the necessity of submitting in multitudes of cases, to pay unjust demands, rather than follow suitors, through great expence, to far distant tribunals, and to be determined upon there, as it may be, without a jury.—In this congressional legislature, a bare majority of votes can enact commercial laws, so that the representatives of the seven northern states, as they will have a majority, can by law create the most oppressive monopoly upon the five southern states, whose circumstances and productions are essentially different from theirs, [64]although not a single man of these voters are the representatives of, or amenable to the people of the southern states. Can such a set of men be, with the least colour of truth called a representative of those they make laws for? It is supposed that the policy of the northern states will prevent such abuses. But how feeble, Sir, is policy when opposed to interest among trading people:—And what is the restraint arising from policy? Why that we may be forced by abuse to become ship-builders!—But how long will it be before a people of agriculture can produce ships sufficient to export such bulky commodities as ours, and of such extent; and if we had the ships, from whence are the seamen to come? 4000 of whom at least will be necessary in Virginia. In questions so liable to abuse, why was not the necessary vote put to two thirds of the members of the legislature? With the constitution came from the convention, so many members of that body to Congress, and of those too, who were among the most fiery zealots for their system, that the votes of three states being of them, two states divided by them, and many others mixed with them, it is easy to see that Congress could have little opinion upon the subject.5 Some denied our right to make amendments, whilst others more moderate agreed to the right, but denied the expediency of amending; but it was plain that a majority was ready to send it on in terms of approbation—my judgment and conscience forbid the last, and therefore I moved the amendments that I have the honor to send you inclosed herewith, and demanded the yeas and nays that they might appear on the journal. This seemed to alarm and to prevent such appearance on the journal, it was agreed to transmit the constitution without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation; so that the term unanimously only applied to the transmission, as you will observe by attending to the terms of the resolve for transmitting.6 Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that as this constitution abounds with useful regulations, at the same time that it is liable to strong and fundamental objections, the plan for us to pursue, will be to propose the necessary amendments, and express our willingness to adopt it with the amendments, and to suggest the calling of a new convention for the purpose of considering them. To this I see no well founded objection, but great safety and much good to be the probable result. I am perfectly satisfied that you make such use of this letter as you shall think to be for the public good; and now after begging your pardon for so great a trespass on your patience, and presenting my best respects to your lady, I will conclude with assuring you, that I am with the sincerest esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most affectionate and obedient servant, RICHARD HENRY LEE."
Broadside,No,Richard Henry Lee,,,,10/16/1787,"It having been found from universal experience, that the most express declarations and reservations are necessary to protect the just rights and liberty of mankind from the silent, powerful and ever active conspiracy of those who govern; and it appearing to be the sense of the good people of America, by the various bills or declarations of rights whereon the government of the greater number of states are founded. That such precautions are necessary to restrain and regulate the exercise of the great powers given to rulers. In conformity with these principles, and from respect for the public sentiment on this subject, it is submitted,—That the new constitution proposed for the government of the United States be bottomed upon a declaration or bill of rights, clearly and precisely stating the principles upon which this social compact is founded, to wit: That the rights of conscience in matters of religion ought not to be violated—That the freedom of the press shall be secured—That the trial by jury in criminal and civil cases, and the modes prescribed by the common law for the safety of life in criminal prosecutions, shall be held sacred—That standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted, unless assented to by two-thirds of the members composing each house of the legislature under the new constitution—That the elections should be free and frequent; That the right administration of justice should be secured by the independency of the judges; That excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments, should not be demanded or inflicted; That the right of the people to assemble peaceably, for the purpose of petitioning the legislature, shall not be prevented; that the citizens shall not be exposed to unreasonable searches, seizure of their persons, houses, papers or property; and it is necessary for the good of society, that the administration of government be conducted with all possible maturity of judgment, for which reason it hath been the practice of civilized nations, and so determined by every state in the Union: That a council of state or privy council should be appointed to advise and assist in the arduous business assigned to the executive power. Therefore let the new constitution be so amended, as to admit the appointment of a privy council, to consist of eleven members chosen by the president, but responsible for the advice they may give. For which purpose the advice given shall be entered in a council book, and signed by the giver, in all affairs of great moment, and that the counsellors act under an oath of office. In order to prevent the dangerous blending of the legislative and executive powers, and to secure responsibility, the privy, and not the [66]senate shall be joined with the president in the appointment of all officers, civil and military, under the new constitution; that the constitution be so altered as not to admit the creation of a vice-president, when duties as assigned may be discharged by the privy council, except in the instance of proceeding in the senate, which may be supplied by a speaker chosen from the body of senators by themselves, as usual, that so may be avoided the establishment of a great officer of state, who is sometimes to be joined with the legislature, and sometimes to administer the government, rendering responsibility difficult,8 besides giving unjust and needless pre-eminence to that state from whence this officer may have come. That such parts of the new constitution be amended as provide imperfectly for the trial of criminals by a jury of the vicinage, and to supply the omission of a jury trial in civil causes or disputes about property between individuals, whereby the common law is directed, and as generally it is secured by the several state constitutions. That such parts of the new constitution be amended, as permit the vexatious and oppressive callings of citizens from their own country, and all controversies between citizens of different states and between citizens and foreigners, to be tried in a far distant court, and as it may be without a jury, whereby in a multitude of cases, the circumstances of distance and expence may compel numbers to submit to the most unjust and ill-founded demand—That in order to secure the rights of the people more effectually from violation, the power and respectability of the house of representatives be increased, by increasing the number of delegates to that house, where the popular interest must chiefly depend for protection—That the constitution be so amended as to increase the number of votes necessary to determine questions in cases where a bare majority may be seduced by strong motives of interest to injure and oppress the minority of the community, as in commercial regulations, where advantage may be taken of circumstances to ordain rigid and premature laws, that will in effect amount to monopolies, to the great impoverishment of those states whose peculiar situation expose them to such injuries"
Newspaper,No,Cato Uticensis,,Independent Chronicle,,10/17/1787,"To the FREEMEN of Virginia. Adventuring, this day, to call your attention to one of the most serious and awful subjects, that ever was agitated by a free people, I must, in the most unfeigned manner, supplicate your kindest indulgence. I must, (it would be presumption to deny it) own that the head which dictates these words, and the hand, which guides this pen, trembles at this moment with reverential awe; and, if I mistake not, there [71]are few among you,2 whose own feelings will leave any room to doubt it, when you are informed, that I am summing up the courage to question the merits of the Federal Constitution, proposed to your consideration by the late General Convention. In the hour of distress, in the moment of confusion and perilous danger, after separately declaring themselves sovereign and independent, the Thirteen States of America associated together in a Federal league, for their common defense, an affair of such magnitude, formed under the influence of such unfavorable circumstances, could not fail of receiving a tinge from them; consequently, when the war, that link, which supplied each defect was over, the yawning and the chasms of the building began to give evident marks of the hastiness of the workmen: America saw, that without the help of a better cement, the different members were likely to fall asunder, and that, though we may find a lodging in some of the separated pavilions, we must bid adieu to the grandeur and dignity of being inhabitants of a stately palace. The State of Virginia had the honor of taking the lead in this business, and well aware of its magnitude and import, she delegated some of her choicest sons to it, as did the other States, the result has been anxiously waited for, and in the confidence of its being the offspring of the combined abilities and integrity of America, nobody doubted discovering in it the characteristic features of the parents. The reverence, which every man must feel for them, made me, on examining it, guard against my own opinion with the utmost severity. But, as it is not in the power of man to give up, in any single instance, the dictates of his reason, when he has once been convinced of the propriety of allowing his judgment to be swayed by no other motive, I thought it beneath the dignity of a free agent, with strength of conviction on my mind, to sacrifice it to any authority or predilection whatsoever. To acquire this conviction, ’tis true, I had no small difficulty to bring myself to examine the Federal Constitution abstracting from its authors; I hope, nevertheless, that every freeman in Virginia will, in this momentous matter, take the same method, will nobly dare to think for himself, and will not be lulled, perhaps into a fatal stupor, by the whistling of any names whatsoever; this, I am sure, is the wish of the most exalted characters, that formed the Federal Convention; and, believe me, when you will not use this privilege, you are no longer worthy to bear the name of freemen. I would wish to find it sunk deep into your recollection, and be early impressed upon the minds of your children, that all the republics, which were, and are not, in the world, owed their loss of liberty and their dissolution, to an over-weaning reverence for men and their measures. This consideration [72]is not thrown out to you, with the impious arrogance of insinuating the least doubt of the upright and patriotic views, of the Delegates who formed the late General Convention; a vain and presumptuous attempt of that kind would, undoubtedly, have no other effect with you, than that of branding the man, who could be guilty of it, with the most deserved infamy and contempt. The intention of it is, to induce you, as it behooves freemen, to meet the consideration of this matter, with minds purged of all kind of prejudice, and ready to yield to the conviction of your reason—Humanum est errare. The lot of human nature renders it liable to error, and, if we discover it here, it will be a great practical lesson, to humble ourselves before the fountain of ALL WISDOM. Though I have not the fondness to think, that any remarks of mine shall influence the political conduct of any one, I may, perhaps without incurring the imputation of self-sufficiency, indulge myself with the hopes, that they may call forth some abler pens to agitate this matter. It is surely to be wished, that the attention of the Citizens of the different States should be fixed, in a cool, dispassionate manner, to a subject, which is to have so direct an influence on the future prosperity of them and their posterity. It has been the language, since the peace, of the most virtuous and discerning men in America, that the powers vested in Congress were inadequate to the procuring of the benefits, that should result from the union: It was found, that our national character was sinking in the opinion of foreign nations, and, that the selfish views of some of the States were likely to become the source of dangerous jealousy; the requisitions of Congress were set at naught; the Government, that represented the Union, had not a shilling in its Treasury to enable it to pay off the Federal debts, nor, had it any method within its power to alter its situation; it could make treaties of commerce, but could not enforce the observance of them, and it was felt, that we were suffering from the restrictions of foreign nations, who seeing the want of energy in our Federal Constitution, and the unlikelihood of co-operation in thirteen separate Legislatures, had shackled our commerce, without any dread of recrimination on our part: To obviate these grievances, it was, I believe, the general opinion, that new powers should be vested in Congress, to enable it, in the amplest manner, to regulate the commerce, to lay and collect duties on the imports, of the United States. Delegates were appointed by most of them, for these purposes, to a Convention, to be held at Annapolis in the September before last; a few of them met, and without waiting for the others, who were coming on, they dissolved the Convention, after resolving among themselves, that the powers vested in them were not sufficiently [73]extensive, and, that they would apply to the Legislatures of the several States, which they represented, to appoint members to another Convention, with powers to new model the Federal Constitution. This, indeed, it has now done in the most unequivocal manner, nor has it stopped here, for it has fairly annihilated the Constitution of each individual state. It has proposed to you a high prerogative government, which, like Aron’s serpent, is to swallow up the rest:3 this is what the thinking people in America were apprehensive of; they knew how difficult it is to hit the golden mean, how natural the transition is from one extreme to the other; from anarchy to tyranny; from the inconvenient laxity of thirteen separate Governments to the too sharp and grinding one, before which our sovereignty, as a state, was to vanish. In Art. 1, Sect. 8. of the proposed Federal Constitution; it is said, “Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.”—Are you then, Virginians, about to abandon your country to the depredations of excisemen, and the pressure of excise laws? Did it ever enter the mind of any one of you, that you could live to see the day, that any other government, but the General Assembly of Virginia, should have power of direct taxation in this state? How few of you ever expected to see excise laws, the instruments of tyranny, in force in your country? But who could imagine that any man but a Virginian, were they found to be necessary, would ever have a voice towards enacting them? That any tribunal, but the Courts of Virginia, would be allowed to take cognizance of disputes between her citizens and their tax-gatherers and their excisemen? And that, if it should ever be found necessary to curse this land with these hateful excisemen, anyone, but a fellow citizen, should be entrusted with that office? For my part, I cannot discover the necessity there was of allowing Congress to subject us to excise laws, unless, that considering the extensiveness of the single republic into which this Constitution would collect all the others, and the well-known difficulty of governing large republics with harmony and ease, it was thought expedient to bit our mouths with massive curbs, to break us, bridled with excise laws, and managed by excisemen, into an uniform, sober pace, and thus, gradually, tame the troublesome mettle of the freeman. This necessity could not, surely, arise from the desire of furnishing Congress with a sufficient revenue, to enable it to exercise the prerogatives, which every friend to America would wish to see vested in it; as it would, by unanimous consent, have the management of the impost, it could increase it to any amount, and this would fall sufficiently uniform on every one, according to his ability; or, were this not found sufficient, could not the deficiency be made up by requisitions to the states? Could it not [74]have been made an article of the Federal Constitution, that, if any of them refused their quota, Congress may be allowed to make it up by an increase of the impost, on that particular state so refusing. This would, surely, be a sufficient security to Congress, that their requisitions would be punctually complied with. In any dispute between you and the revenue officers and excisemen of Congress, it is true, that it is provided, the trial shall be, in the first instance, within the state, though before a Federal tribunal: It is said in par. 3. sect. 2. art. 3, “The trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachments shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the crimes shall be committed;” but what does this avail, when an appeal will lie against you to the Supreme Federal Court—In the paragraph preceding the one just now quoted, it is said, “In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned,(a) the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.” But where is this Supreme Court to sit? Will it not be, where Congress shall fix its residence? Thither then you will be carried for trial. Who are to be your jury? Is there any provision made, that you shall have a Venire from your county, or even from your state, as they please to call it? No! you are to be tried within the territory of Congress, and Congress itself is to be a party; you are to be deprived of the benefit of a jury from your vicinage, that boast and birthright of a freeman. Should it not, at least, have been provided, that those revenue officers and excisemen, against whom free governments have, always, justly entertained a jealousy, should be citizens of the state? Was it inadmissible, that, they should be endued with the bowels of fellow-citizens? Are we not to expect, that New England will now send us revenue officers, instead of their onions and their apples? When you observe, that the few places, already, under Congress in this state are in the hands of strangers, you will own, that my suspicion is not without some foundation: and, if the first cause of it be required, those, who have served in Congress, can tell you, that the New England Delegates to that Assembly have always stood by each other, and have formed a firm phalanx, which the southern Delegates have not; that, on the contrary, the maneuvers of the former have been commonly engaged, with success, in dividing the latter, against each other. The force of names and of habits is well known, though Scotland and England go now under the general name of Great Britain, the distinction of Scot[c]human and Englishman still subsists, and, how often has the latter [75]complained, that, that northern hive was continually swarming its hungry instruments of undue prerogative over his country. The ingenious Lord Shaftsbury has said that a wheel within a wheel was an absurdity in politics;4 but, where was this ever so manifest, as in this Federal Constitution. The phantom of sovereignty, which is left the state, enables it to legislate in many instances, and lay taxes; to have its tax-gatherers and excisemen too. Unhappy situation where the natural jealousy, and the pride inherent in two separate governments, presiding over the same people, will induce them to vie in the race of taxation to snatch the prize, the spoils of the citizen, that is to glut the vanity of their respective consequence! he, who has meditated on man, and the secret springs, which move him, must expect this. Unhappy situation where two rival excisemen battle at your doors for precedence in seizing these spoils!—In the name of God look well before you leap, consider, that the question is, whether, you would rather be a sovereign or a sharer in sovereignty: whether, as only a few from their abilities and consequence can expect to be delegated, in rotation, to Congress, you are not about to lay the foundation of a dangerous aristocracy. Whether, it is, not more likely that the blaze of LIBERTY will be kept alive among us, when watched on thirteen separate Altars, than when reunited into one, be it ever so refulgent. Consider, whether you are willing to see the state of Virginia dwindle into the insignificance of a town corporate: and as the Mayor Court of Alderman and Common Council in this make by-laws for its own government, you are satisfied with a Governor, Senate, and Assembly, which will have the same authority as “the United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a Republican FORM of government.” Consider that if you pass the Federal Constitution in toto, you subject yourselves to see the doors of your houses, the impenetrable castles of freemen, fly open before the magic wand of an exciseman, and, that, if you should resent and punish the insolence of office, the daring brutality of the publican, perhaps offered to the wife of thy bosom, you will be dragged for trial before a distant tribunal, and there, perhaps, condemned without enjoying the benefit of a jury from your vicinage, your unalienable birthright as a freeman. October 10, 1787. (a)See the Federal Constitution."
Letter,No,Elbridge Gerry,General Council,,,10/18/1787,"Gentlemen I have the honor to inclose, pursuant to my Commission, the constitution proposed by the Fœderal Convention.1 To this system I gave my dissent, & shall submit my objections to the honorable Legislature It was painful for me, on a subject of such national importance, to differ from the respectable Members who signed the constitution: but conceiving as I did, that the liberties of America were not secured by the system, it was my duty to oppose it— My principal objections to the plan, are that there is no adequate provision for a representation of the People—that they have no security for the right of election—that some of the powers of the Legislature are ambiguous, & others indefinite & dangerous2—that the executive is blended with & will have an undue influence over the legislature—that the Judicial department will be oppressive—that treaties of the highest importance may be formed by the president with [99]the advice of two thirds of a quorum of the Senate—& that the System is without the Security of a Bill of rights, these are objections which are not local, but apply equally to all the States— As the Convention was called for “the sole & express purpose of revising the articles of confederation, & reporting to Congress & the several Legislatures such alterations & provisions as shall render the fœderal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government, & the preservation of the union,”3 I did not conceive that these powers extended to the formation of the plan proposed, but the Convention being of a different opinion, I acquiesced in it, being fully convinced that to preserve the union, an efficient Government was indispensibly necessary; & that it would be difficult to make proper amendments to the articles of confederation. The Constitution proposed has few, if any Fœderal features, but is rather a system of national government: nevertheless, in many respects I think it has great merit, & by proper amendments, may be adapted to the “exigencies of Government” & preservation of Liberty. The question on this plan involves others of the highest importance 1st Whether there shall be a dissolution of the Fœderal Government? 2dly Whether the several State Governments shall be so altered, as in effect to be dissolved? and 3dly Whether in lieu of the Fœderal & state Governments, the national constitution now proposed shall be substituted without amendment? never perhaps were a people called on to decide a question of greater magnitude—should the Citizens of America adopt the plan as it now stands, their liberties may be lost: or should they reject it altogether Anarchy may ensue, it is evident therefore that they should not be precipitate in their decissions; that the subject should be well understood, lest they should refuse to support the Government, after having hastily accepted it. If those who are in favour of the Constitution, as well as those who are against it, should preserve moderation, their discussions may afford much information & finally direct to an happy issue. It may be urged by some, that an implicit confidence should be placed in the Convention: but however respectable the members may be who signed the constitution, it must be admitted, that a free people are the proper Guardians of their rights & liberties—that the greatest men may err—& that their errors are sometimes, of the greatest magnitude. Others may suppose, that the constitution may be safely adopted, because therein provision is made to amend it: but cannot this object be better attained before a ratification than after it? and should a free people, adopt a form of Government, under conviction that it wants amendment? [100] And some may conceive, that if the Plan is not accepted by the people they will not unite in another: but surely whilst they have the power to amend, they are not under the necessity of rejecting it. I have been detained here longer than I expected, but shall leave this place in a day or two for Massachusetts, & on my arrival shall submit the reasons (if required by the Legislature) on which my objections are grounded. I shall only add, that as the Welfare of the union requires a better Constitution than the confederation, I shall think it my duty as a Citizen of Massachusetts to support that which shall be finally adopted, sincerely hoping it will secure the Liberty & happiness of America. I have the Honor to be Gentlemen with the highest respect for the honorable Legislature & yourselves, your most obedt & very hum servt E Gerry"
Letter,Yes,George Mason,Elbridge Gerry,,,10/20/1787,"There is great Contrariety of Opinion in Virginia upon the new Constitution of Government, & tho’ in general it seems to be approved, Yet even its Advocates can not deny that there are in it some very exceptionable & unsafe Articles. I have no Doubt of our Legislatures referring it to a Convention of the People; where it will probably undergo some Alterations. It wou’d be fortunate for America, if the Conventions in the different States cou’d meet upon this important Business about the same time: by a regular & cordial Communication of Sentiments, confining themselves to a few necessary amendments, & determining to join heartily in the System so amended, they might, without Danger of public Convulsion or Confusion, procure a general Adoption of the new Government; but shou’d many of the States pursue such intemperate & violent Measures as the Legislature of Pensylvania [87]has done,2 it requires no great Degree of Penetration to foresee the Consequences—a federal System will be defeated by the rash & improper means taken to support it, & the People of these United States involved in all the Evils of Civil War.—Indeed the precipitation with which the City of Philadelphia,3 & that party in their Legislature, are attempting to force the new Government upon the People, betrays their Consciousness of it’s not bearing the Test of impartial examination—they dread a thorough Knowledge & public Discussion of the Subject, & wish to hurry it down, during the short & raging hour of Approbation.— I beg You will inform me what are the Sentiments of the wise & disinterested part of Your State, & what will probably be the Fate of the new System there; for there is no trusting to public reports or common News Paper Intelligence. As my Objections, which I shewed You to the new Government, were written in a Hurry, & very incorrect, I take the Liberty of inclosing You a more correct Copy."
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,10/22/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Whoever attentively examines the history of America, and compares it with that of other nations, will find its commencement, its growth, and its present situation, without a precedent. It must ever prove a source of pleasure to the Philosopher, who ranges the explored parts of this inhabitable globe, and takes a comparative view, as well of the rise and fall of those nations, which have been and are gone, as of the growth and present existence of those which are now in being, to close his prospect with this Western world. In proportion as he loves his fellow creatures, he must here admire and approve; for while they have severally laid their foundations in the blood and slaughter of three, four, and sometimes, ten successive generations, from their passions have experience[d], every misery to which human nature is subject, and at this day present striking features of usurped power, unequal justice, and despotic tyranny, America stands completely systemised without any of these misfortunes.—On the contrary, from the first settlement of the country, the necessity of civil associations, founded upon equality, consent, and proportionate justice have ever been universally acknowledged.—The means of education always attended to, and the fountains of science brought within the reach of poverty.—Hitherto we have commenced society, and advanced in all respects resembling a family, without partial affections, or even a domestic bickering: And if we consider her as an individual, instead of an undue proportion of violent passions and bad habits, we must set her down possessed of reason, genius and virtue.—I premise these few [110]observations because there are too many among us of narrow minds, who live in the practice of blasting the reputation of their own country.—They hold it as a maxim, that virtues cannot grow in their own soil.—They will appreciate those of a man, they know nothing about, because he is an exotic; while they are sure to depreciate those much more brilliant in their neighbours, because they are really acquainted with and know them. Civil society is a blessing.—It is here universally known as such.—The education of every child in this country tends to promote it.—There is scarcely a citizen in America who does not wish to bring it, consistent with our situation and circumstances, to its highest state of improvement.—Nay, I may say further, that the people in general aim to effect this point, in a peaceable, laudable, and rational way. These assertions are proved by stubborn facts, and I need only resort to that moment, when, in contest with a powerful enemy, they paid such an unprecedented attention to civilization, as to select from among themselves their different conventions, and form their several constitutions, which, for their beautiful theoretical structure, caught the admiration of our enemies, and secured to us the applause of the world.—We at this day feel the effects of this disposition, and now live under a government of our own choice, constructed by ourselves, upon unequivocal principles, and requires but to be well administ[e]red to make us as happy under it as generally falls to the lot of humanity. The disturbances in the course of the year past cannot be placed as an objection to the principle I advance.—They took their rise in idleness, extravagance and misinformation, a want of knowledge of our several finances, a universal delusion at the close of the war, and in consequence thereof, a pressure of embarrassments, which checked, and in many cases, destroyed that disposition of forbearance, which ought to be exercised towards each other. These were added to the accursed practice of letting money at usury, and some few real difficulties and grievances, which our late situation unavoidably brought upon us. The issue of them, however, rather proves the position for, a very few irreclaimables excepted, we find even an anxiety to hearken to reason pervading all classes—industry and frugality increasing, and the advantages arising from good, wholesome laws, confessed by every one.—Let who will gain say it, I am confident we are in a much better situation, in all respects, than we were at this period the last year; and as fast as can be expected, consistent with the passions and habits of a free people, of men who will think for themselves, coalescing, as a correspondent observes in a late paper, under a firm, wise and efficient government.2 The powers vested in Congress have hitherto been found inadequate.—Who are [111]those that have been against investing them? The people of this Commonwealth have very generally supposed it expedient, and the farmer equally with the merchant have taken steps to effect it.—A Convention from the different States for that sole purpose hath been appointed of their most respectable citizens—respectable indeed I may say for their equity, for their literature, and for their love of their country.—Their proceedings are now before us for our approbation.—The eagerness with which they have been received by certain classes of our fellow citizens, naturally forces upon us this question? Are we to adopt this Government, without an examination?—Some there are, who, literally speaking, are for pressing it upon us at all events. The name of the man who but lisps a sentiment in objection to it, is to be handed to the printer, by the printer to the publick, and by the publick he is to be led to execution.3 They are themselves stabbing its reputation. For my part, I am a stranger to the necessity for all this haste! Is it not a subject of some small importance? Certainly it is.—Are not your lives, your liberties and properties intimately involved in it?—Certainly they are. Is it a government for a moment, a day, or a year? By no means—but for ages—Altered it may possibly be, but it is easier to correct before it is adopted.—Is it for a family, a state, or a small number of people? It is for a number no less respectable than three millions. Are the enemy at our gates, and have we not time to consider it? Certainly we have. Is it so simple in its form as to be comprehended instantly?—Every letter, if I may be allowed the expression, is an idea. Does it consist of but few additions to our present confederation, and those which have been from time to time described among us, and known to be necessary?—Far otherwise.—It is a compleat system of government, and armed with every power, that a people in any circumstances ought to bestow. It is a path newly struck out, and a new set of ideas are introduced that have neither occurred or been digested.—A government for national purposes, preserving our constitution entire, hath been the only plan hitherto agitated. I do not pretend to say, but it is in theory the most unexceptionable, and in practice will be the most conducive to our happiness of any possible to be adopted:—But it ought to undergo a candid and strict examination. It is the duty of every one in the Commonwealth to communicate his sentiments to his neighbour, divested of passion, and equally so of prejudices. If they are honest and he is a real friend to his country, he will do it and embrace every opportunity to do it. If thoroughly looked into before it is adopted, the people will be more apt to approve of it in practice, and every man is a TRAITOR to himself and his posterity, who shall ratify it with his signature, without first endeavouring to understand it.—We [112]are but yet in infancy; and we had better proceed slow than too fast.—It is much easier to dispense powers, than recall them.—The present generation will not be drawn into any system; they are too enlightened; they have not forfeited their right to a share in government, and they ought to enjoy it. Some are heard to say, “When we consider the men who made it, we ought to take it for sterling, and without hesitation—that they were the collected wisdom of the States, and had no object but the general good.”—I do not doubt all this, but facts ought not to be winked out of sight:—They were delegated from different States, and nearly equally represented, though vastly disproportionate both in wealth and numbers. They had local prejudices to combat, and in many instances, totally opposite interests to consult. Their situations, their habits, their extent, and their particular interest, varied each from the other. The gentlemen themselves acknowledge that they have been less rigid upon some points, in consequence of those difficulties than they otherwise should have been.—Others again tell you that the Convention is or will be dissolved; that we must take their proceedings in whole or reject them—But this surely cannot be a reason for their speedy adoption; it rather works the other way. If evils are acknowledged in the composition, we ought, at least, to see whose shoulders are to bear the most; to compare ours with those of other States, and take care that we are not saddled with more than our proportion: That the citizens of Philadelphia are running mad after it, can be no argument for us to do the like:—Their situation is almost contrasted with ours; they suppose themselves a central State; they expect the perpetual residence of Congress, which of itself alone will ensure their aggrandizement: We, on the contrary, are sure to be near one of the extremes; neither the loaves or fishes will be so plenty with us, or shall we be so handy to procure them.— We are told by some people, that upon the adopting this New Government, we are to become every thing in a moment:—Our foreign and domestic debts will be as a feather; our ports will be crowded with the ships of all the world, soliciting our commerce and our produce: Our manufactures will increase and multiple; and, in short, if we STAND STILL, our country, notwithstanding, will be like the blessed Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. Let us not deceive ourselves; the only excellency of any government is in exact proportion to the administration of it:—Idleness and luxury will be as much a bane as ever; our passions will be equally at war with us then as now; and if we have men among us trying with all their ability to undermine our [113]present Constitution, these very persons will direct their force to sap the vitals of the new one. Upon the whole, my fellow countrymen, I am as much a federal man as any person: In a federal union lies our political salvation—To preserve that union, and make it respectable to foreign opticks, the National Government ought to be armed with all necessary powers; but the subject I conceive of infinite delicacy, and requires both ability and reflection. In discus[s]ing points of such moment, America has nothing to do with passions or hard words; every citizen has an undoubted right to examine for himself, neither ought he to be ill treated and abused, because he does not think at the same moment exactly as we do. It is true, that many of us have but our liberties to lose, but they are dearly bought, and are not the least precious in estimation:—In the mean time, is it not of infinite consequence, that we pursue inflexibly that path, which I feel persuaded we are now approaching, wherein we shall discourage all foreign importations; shall see the necessity of greater economy and industry; shall smile upon the husbandman, and reward the industrious mechanick; shall promote the growth of our own country, and wear the produce of our own farms; and, finally, shall support measures in proportion to their honesty and wisdom, without any respect to men. Nothing more is wanted to make us happy at home, and respectable abroad."
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,10/29/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In my last address upon the proceedings of the Federal Convention, [157]I endeavored to convince you of the importance of the subject, that it required a cool, dispassionate examination, and a thorough investigation, previous to its adoption—that it was not a mere revision and amendment of our first Confederation, but a compleat System for the future government of the United States, and I may now add in preference to, and in exclusion of, all others heretofore adopted.—It is not temporary, but in its nature, PERPETUAL.—It is not designed that you shall be annually called, either to revise, correct, or renew it; but, that your posterity shall grow up under, and be governed by it, as well as ourselves.—It is not so capable of alterations as you would at the first reading suppose; and I venture to assert, it never can be, unless by force of arms. The fifth article in the proceedings, it is true, expressly provides for an alteration under certain conditions, whenever “it shall be ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress.”—Notwithstanding which, such are the “heterogeneous materials from which this System was formed,” such is the difference of interest, different manners, and different local prejudices, in the different parts of the United States, that to obtain that majority of three fourths to any one single alteration, essentially affecting this or any other State, amounts to an absolute impossibility. The conduct of the Delegates in dissolving the Convention, plainly speaks this language, and no other.—Their sentiments in their Letter to his Excellency the President of Congress are—That this Constitution was the result of a spirit of amity—that the parties came together disposed to concede as much as possible each to the other—that mutual concessions and compromises did, in fact, take place, and all those which could, consistent with the peculiarity of their political situation.2 Their dissolution enforces the same sentiment, by confining you to the alternative of taking or refusing their doings in the gross. In this view, who is there to be found among us, who can seriously assert, that this Constitution, after ratification and being practised upon, will be so easy of alteration? Where is the probability that a future Convention, in any future day, will be found possessed of a greater spirit of amity and mutual concession than the present? Where is the probability that three fourths of the States in that Convention,3 or three fourths of the Legislatures of the different States, whose interests differ scarcely in nothing short of every thing, will be so very ready or willing materially to change any part of this System, which shall be to the emolument of an individual State only? No, my fellow-citizens, as you [158]are now obliged to take it in the whole, so you must hereafter administer it in whole, without the prospect of change, unless by again reverting to a state of Nature, which will be ever opposed with success by those who approve of the Government in being. That the want of a Bill of Rights to accompany this proposed System, is a solid objection to it, provided there is nothing exceptionable in the System itself, I do not assert.—If, however, there is at any time, a propriety in having one, it would not have been amiss here. A people, entering into society, surrender such a part of their natural rights, as shall be necessary for the existence of that society. They are so precious in themselves, that they would never be parted with, did not the preservation of the remainder require it. They are entrusted in the hands of those, who are very willing to receive them, who are naturally fond of exercising of them, and whose passions are always striving to make a bad use of them.—They are conveyed by a written compact, expressing those which are given up, and the mode in which those reserved shall be secured. Language is so easy of explanation, and so difficult is it by words to convey exact ideas, that the party to be governed cannot be too explicit. The line cannot be drawn with too much precision and accuracy. The necessity of this accuracy and this precision encreases in proportion to the greatness of the sacrifice and the numbers who make it.—That a Constitution for the United States does not require a Bill of Rights, when it is considered, that a Constitution for an individual State would, I cannot conceive.—The difference between them is only in the numbers of the parties concerned; they are both a compact between the Governors and Governed, the letter of which must be adhered to in discussing their powers. That which is not expressly granted, is of course retained. The Compact itself is a recital upon paper of that proportion of the subject’s natural rights, intended to be parted with, for the benefit of adverting to it in case of dispute. Miserable indeed would be the situation of those individual States who have not prefixed to their Constitutions a Bill of Rights, if, as a very respectable, learned Gentleman at the Southward observes, “the People, when they established the powers of legislation under their separate Governments, invested their Representatives with every right and authority which they did not, in explicit terms, reserve; and therefore upon every question, respecting the jurisdiction of the House of Assembly, if the Frame of Government is silent, the jurisdiction is efficient and complete.”4 In other words, those powers which the people by their Constitutions expressly give them, they enjoy by positive grant, and those remaining ones, which they never meant to give them, and which the Constitutions say nothing [159]about, they enjoy by tacit implication, so that by one means and by the other, they became possessed of the whole.—This doctrine is but poorly calculated for the meridian of America, where the nature of compact, the mode of construing them, and the principles upon which society is founded, are so accurately known and universally diffused. That insatiable thirst for unconditional controul over our fellow-creatures, and the facility of sounds to convey essentially different ideas, produced the first Bill of Rights ever prefixed to a Frame of Government. The people, altho’ fully sensible that they reserved every tittle of power they did not expressly grant away, yet afraid that the words made use of, to express those rights so granted might convey more than they originally intended, they chose at the same moment to express in different language those rights which the agreement did not include, and which they never designed to part with, endeavoring thereby to prevent any cause for future altercation and the intrusion into society of that doctrine of tacit implication which has been the favorite theme of every tyrant from the origin of all governments to the present day. The proceedings of the Convention are new handed to you by your Legislature, and the second Wednesday in January is appointed for your final answer. To enable you to give that with propriety; that your future reflections may produce peace, however opposed the present issue of your present conduct may be to your present expectations, you must determine, that, in order to support with dignity the Federal Union, it is proper and fit, that the present Confederation shall be annihilated:—That the future Congress of the United States shall be armed with the powers of Legislation, Judgment and Execution:—That annual elections in this Congress shall not be known, and the most powerful body, the Senate, in which a due proportion of representation is not preserved, and in which the smallest State has equal weight with the largest, be the longest in duration:—That it is not necessary for the publick good, that persons habituated to the exercise of power should ever be reminded from whence they derive it, by a return to the station of private citizens, but that they shall at all times at the expiration of the term for which they were elected to an office, be capable of immediate re-election to that same office:—That you will hereafter risque the probability of having the Chief Executive Branch chosen from among you; and that it is wholly indifferent, both to you and your children after you, whether this future Government shall be administered within the territories of your own State, or at the distance of four thousand miles from them.—You must also determine, that they shall have the exclusive power of imposts and the duties on imports and exports, the power of laying excises and other duties, and the [160]additional power of laying internal taxes upon your lands, your goods, your chattels, as well as your persons at their sovereign pleasure:—That the produce of these several funds shall be appropriated to the use of the United States, and collected by their own officers, armed with a military force, if a civil aid should not prove sufficient:—That the power of organizing, arming and disciplining the militia shall be lodged in them, and this thro’ fear that they shall not be sufficiently attentive to keeping so respectable a body of men as the yeomanry of this Commonwealth, compleatly armed, organized and disciplined; they shall have also the power of raising, supporting and establishing a standing army in time of peace in your several towns, and I see not why in your several houses:—That should an insurrection or an invasion, however small, take place, in Georgia, the extremity of the Continent, it is highly expedient they should have the power of suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus in Massachusetts, and as long as they shall judge the public safety requires it:—You must also say, that your present Supreme Judicial Court shall be an Inferior Court to a Continental Court, which is to be inferior to the Supreme Court of the United States:—That from an undue biass which they are supposed to have for the citizens of their own States, they shall not be competent to determine title to your real estate, disputes which may arise upon a protested Bill of Exchange, a simple note of hand, or book debt, wherein your citizens shall be unfortunately involved with disputes of such or any other kind, with citizens either of other States or foreign States: In all such cases they shall have a right to carry their causes to the Supreme Court of the United States, whether for delay only or vexation; however distant from the place of your abode, or inconsistent with your circumstances:—That such appeals shall be extended to matters of fact as well as law, and a trial of the cause by jury you shall not have a right to insist upon.—In short, my fellow-citizens, previous to a capacity of giving a compleat answer to their proceedings, you must determine that the Constitution of your Commonwealth, which is instructive, beautiful and consistent in practice, which has been justly admired in Europe, as a model of perfection, and which the present Convention have affected to imitate, a Constitution which is especially calculated for your territory, and is made conformable to your genius, your habits, the mode of holding your estates, and your particular interests, shall be reduced in its powers to those of a City Corporation:—The skeleton of it may remain, but its vital principle shall be transferred to the new Government: Nay, you must go still further, and agree to invest the new Congress with powers, which you have yet thought proper to withhold from your own present [161]Government.—All these, and more, which are contained in the proceedings of the Federal Convention, may be highly proper and necessary.—In this overturn of all individual Governments, in this new-fashioned set of ideas, and in this total dereliction of those sentiments which animated us in 1775, the Political Salvation of the United States may be very deeply interested, but BE CAUTIOUS."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/1/1787,"Mr. Greenleaf, A speech made to the citizens of Philadelphia, and said to be by Mr. WILSON, appears to me to abound with sophistry, so dangerous, as to require refutation. If we adopt the new Constitution, let us at least understand it. Whether it deserves adoption or not, we can only determine by a full examination of it, so as clearly to discern what it is that we are so loudly, I had almost said, indecently called upon to receive. Such an examination is the object of the papers which I am to entreat you to lay before the public, in answer to Mr. Wilson, and under the signature of—Cincinnatus. SIR, You have had the graciousness. Sir, to come forward as the defender and panegyrist of the plan of a new Constitution, of which you was one of the framers. If the defence you have thought proper to set up, and the explanations you have been pleased to give, should be found, upon a full and fair examination, to be fallacious or inadequate; I am not without hope, that candor, of which no gentleman talks more, will render you a convert to the opinion, that some material parts of the proposed Constitution are so constructed—that a monstrous aristocracy springing from it, must necessarily swallow up the democratic rights of the union, and sacrifice the liberties of the people to the power and domination of a few. If your defence of this new plan of power, has, as you say, been matured by four months constant meditation upon it, and is yet so very weak, as I trust will appear, men will begin to think, that—the thing [162]itself is indefensible. Upon a subject so momentous, the public has a right to the sentiments of every individual that will reason: I therefore do not think any apology necessary for appearing in print; and I hope to avoid, at least, the indiscriminate censure which you have, with so much candor and liberality, thrown on those who will not worship your idol—“that they are industriously endeavouring to prevent and destroy it, by insidious and clandestine attempts.” Give me leave just to suggest, that perhaps these clandestine attempts might have been owing to the terror of your mob, which so nobly endeavoured to prevent all freedom of action and of speech.1 The reptile Doctor, who was employed to blow the trumpet of persecution, would have answered the public reasoning of an opponent, by hounding on him the rage of a deluded populace.2 It was to such men, and under such impressions, that you made the speech which I am now to examine; no wonder then that it was received with loud and unanimous testamonies of their approbation. They were vociferating through you the panegyric of their own intemperate opinions. Your first attempt is to apologize for so very obvious a defect as—the omission of a declaration of rights. This apology consists in a very ingenious discovery; that in the state constitutions, whatever is not reserved is given; but in the congressional constitution, whatever is not given, is reserved. This has more the quaintness of a conundrum, than the dignity of an argument. The conventions that made the state and the general constitutions, sprang from the same source, were delegated for the same purpose—that is, for framing rules by which we should be governed, and ascertaining those powers which it was necessary to vest in our rulers. Where then is this distinction to be found, but in your assumption? Is it in the powers given to the members of convention? no—Is it in the constitution? not a word of it:—And yet on this play of words, this dictum of yours, this distinction without a difference, you would persuade us to rest our most essential rights. I trust, however, that the good sense of this free people cannot be so easily imposed on by professional figments. The confederation, in its very outset, declares—that what is not expressly given, is reserved.3 This constitution makes no such reservation. The presumption therefore is, that the framers of the proposed constitution, did not mean to subject it to the same exception. You instance, Sir, the liberty of the press; which you would persuade us, is in no danger, though not secured, because there is no express power granted to regulate literary publications. But you surely know, Sir, that where general powers are expressly granted, the particular [163]ones comprehended within them, must also be granted. For instance, the proposed Congress are empowered—to define and punish offences against the law of nations—mark well, Sir, if you please—to define and punish. Will you, will any one say, can any one even think that does not comprehend a power to define and declare all publications from the press against the conduct of government, in making treaties, or in any other foreign transactions, an offence against the law of nations? If there should ever be an influential president, or arbitrary senate, who do not choose that their transactions with foreign powers should be discussed or examined in the public prints, they will easily find pretexts to prevail upon the other branch to concur with them, in restraining what it may please them to call—the licentiousness of the press. And this may be, even without the concurrence of the representatives of the people; because the president and senate are empowered to make treaties, and these treaties are declared the supreme law of the land. What use they will make of this power, is not now the question. Certain it is, that such power is given, and that power is not restrained by any declaration—that the liberty of the press, which even you term, the sacred palladium of national freedom, shall be forever free and inviolable. I have proved that the power of restraining the press, is necessarily involved in the unlimited power of defining offences, or of making treaties, which are to be the supreme law of the land. You acknowledge, that it is not expressly excepted, and consequently it is at the mercy of the powers to be created by this constitution. Let us suppose then, that what has happened, may happen again: That a patriotic printer, like Peter Zenger, should incur the resentment of our new rulers, by publishing to the world, transactions which they wish to conceal. If he should be prosecuted, if his judges should be as desirous of punishing him, at all events, as the judges were to punish Peter Zenger, what would his innocence or his virtue avail him? This constitution is so admirably framed for tyranny, that, by clear construction, the judges might put the verdict of a jury out of the question. Among the cases in which the court is to have appellate jurisdiction, are—controversies, to which the United States are a party:—In this appellate jurisdiction, the judges are to determine, both law and fact. That is, the court is both judge and jury. The attorney general then would have only to move a question of law in the court below, to ground an appeal to the supreme judicature, and the printer would be delivered up to the mercy of his judges. Peter Zenger’s case will teach us, what mercy he might expect. Thus, if the president, vice-president, [164]or any officer, or favorite of state, should be censured in print, he might effectually deprive the printer, or author, of his trial by jury, and subject him to something, that will probably very much resemble the—Star Chamber of former times.4 The freedom of the press, the sacred palladium of public liberty, would be pulled down;—all useful knowledge on the conduct of government would be withheld from the people—the press would become subservient to the purposes of bad and arbitrary rulers, and imposition, not information, would be its object. The printers would do well, to publish the proceedings of the judges, in Peter Zenger’s case—they would do well to publish lord Mansfield’s conduct in, the King against Woodfall;—that the public mind may be property warned of the consequences of agreeing to a constitution, which provides no security for the freedom of the press, and leaves it controversial at least—whether in matter of libels against any of our intended rulers; the printer would even have the security of trial by jury. Yet it was the jury only, that saved Zenger, it was a jury only, that saved Woodfall, it can only be a jury that will save any future printer from the fangs of power.5 Had you, Mr. Wilson, who are so unmerciful against what you are pleased to call, the disingenuous conduct of those who dislike the constitution; had you been ingenuous enough to have stated this fairly to our fellow citizens; had you said to them—gentlemen, it is true, that the freedom of the press is not provided for; it is true, that it may be restrained at pleasure, by our proposed rulers; it is true, that a printer sued for a libel, would not be tried by a jury; all this is true, nay, worse than this is also true; but then it is all necessary to what I think, the best form of government that has ever been offered the world. To have stated these truths, would at least have been acting like an honest man; and if it did not procure you such unanimous testimonies of approbation, what you would have received, would have been merited. But you choose to shew our fellow citizens, nothing but what would flatter and mislead them. You exhibited, that by a rush-light only, which, to dissipate its darkness, required the full force of the meridian sun. When the people are fully apprized of the chains you have prepared for them, if they choose to put them on, you have nothing to answer for. If they choose to be tenants at will of their liberties, by the new constitution; instead of having their freehold in them, secured by a declaration of rights; I can only lament it. There was a time, when our fellow citizens were told, in the words of Sir Edward Coke—For a man to be tenant at will of his liberty, I can never agree to it—Etiam si Dominus non sit molestus, tamen miserremum est, posse, se vebit—Though a despot may not act tyrannically; yet it is dreadful to [165]think, that if he will, he may. Perhaps you may also remember, Sir, that our fellow citizens were then warned against those—“smooth words, with which the most dreadful designs may be glossed over.” You have given us a lively comment on your own text. You have varnished over the iron trap that is prepared, and bated with some illustrious names, to catch the liberties of the people."
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,11/5/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. CIVIL LIBERTY, in all countries, hath been promoted by a free discussion of publick measures, and the conduct of publick men. The FREEDOM OF THE PRESS hath, in consequence thereof, been esteemed one of its safe guards. That freedom gives the right, at all times, to every citizen to lay his sentiments, in a decent manner, before the people. If he will take that trouble upon himself, whether they are in point or not, his countrymen are obliged to him for so doing; for, at least, they lead to an examination of the subject upon which he writes.—If any possible situation makes it a duty, it is our present important one, for in the course of sixty or ninety days you are to approve of or reject the present proceedings of your Convention, which, if established, will certainly effect, in a greater or less degree, during the remainder of your lives, those privileges which you esteem dear to you, and not improbably those of your children for succeeding ages. Now therefore is unquestionably the proper time to examine it, and see if it really is what, upon paper, it appears to be. If with your eyes open, you deliberately accept it, however different it may prove in practice from what it appears in theory, you will have nobody to blame but yourselves; and what is infinitely worse, as I have before endeavoured to observe to you, you will be wholly without a remedy. It has many zealous advocates, and they have attempted, at least as far as their modesty would permit, to monopolize our gazettes, with their encomiums upon it. With the people they have to manage, I would hint to them, their zeal is not their best weapon, and exertions of such a kind, artful attempts to seize the moment, do seldom tend either to elucidate and explain principles, or ensure success. Such conduct ought to be an additional stimulous for those persons who are not its professed admirers, to speak their sentiments with freedom however unpopular.—Such [195]conduct ought to inspire caution, for as a man is invariably known by his company, so is the tendency of principles known by their advocates—Nay, it ought to lead you to enquire who are its advocates? Whether ambitious men throughout America, waiting with impatience to make it a stepping stone to posts of honour and emolument, are not of this class? Whether men who openly profess to be tired of republican governments, and sick to the heart of republican measures; who daily ridicule a government of choice, and pray ardently for one of force, are not of the same class? And, whether there are not men among us, who disapprove of it only because it is not an absolute monarchy, but who, upon the whole, are among its advocates?—In such examinations as these, you cannot mispend a proportion of the sixty days. All contracts are to be construed according to the meaning of the parties at the time of making them. By which is meant, that mutual communications shall take place, and each shall explain to the other their ideas of the contract before them.—If any unfair practices are made use of, if its real tendency is concealed by either party, or any advantage taken in the execution of it, it is in itself fraudulent and may be avoided. There is no difference in the constitution of government—Consent it is allowed is the spring—The form is the mode in which the people choose to direct their affairs, and the magistrates are but trustees to put that mode in force.—It will not be denied, that this people, of any under Heaven, have a right of living under a government of their own choosing.—That government, originally consented to, which is in practice, what it purports to be in theory, is a government of choice; on the contrary, that which is essentially different in practice, from its appearance in theory, however it may be in letter a government of choice, it never can be so in spirit. Of this latter kind appear to me to be the proceedings of the Federal Convention—They are presented as a Frame of Government purely Republican, and perfectly consistent with the individual governments in the Union. It is declared to be constructed for national purposes only, and not calculated to interfere with domestic concerns. You are told, that the rights of the people are very amply secured, and when the wheels of it are put in motion, it will wear a milder aspect than its present one. Whereas the very contrary of all this doctrine appears to be true. Upon an attentive examination you can pronounce it nothing less, than a government which in a few years, will degenerate to a compleat Aristocracy, armed with powers unnecessary in any case to bestow, and which in its vortex swallows up every other Government upon the Continent. In short, my fellow-citizens, it can be said to be nothing less than a hasty stride to Universal [196]Empire in this Western World, flattering, very flattering to young ambitious minds, but fatal to the liberties of the people. The cord is strained to the very utmost.—There is every spice of the Sic. Jubeo1 possible in the composition. Your consent is requested, because it is essential to the introduction of it; after having received confirmation, your complaints may encrease the whistling of the wind, and they will be equally regarded. It cannot be doubted at this day by any men of common sense, that there is a charm in politicks. That persons who enter reluctantly into office become habituated, grow fond of it, and are loath to resign it.—They feel themselves flattered and elevated, and are apt to forget their constituents, until the time returns that they again feel the want of them.—They uniformly exercise all the powers granted to them, and ninety-nine in a hundred are for grasping at more. It is this passionate thirst for power, which has produced different branches to exercise different departments and mutual checks upon those branches. The aristocratical hath ever been found to have the most influence, and the people in most countries have been particularly attentive in providing checks against it. Let us see if it is the case here.—A President, a Senate, and a House of Representatives are proposed. The Judicial Department is at present out of the question, being seperated excepting in impeachments. The Legislative is divided between the People who are the Democratical, and the Senate who are the Aristocratical part, and the Executive between the same Senate and the President who represents the Monarchical Branch—In the construction of this System, their interests are put in opposite scales. If they are exactly balanced, the Government will remain perfect; if there is a prepondency, it will finally prevail. After the first four years, each Senator will hold his seat for the term of six years. This length of time will be amply sufficient of itself to remove any checks that he may have upon his independency, from the fear of a future election. He will consider that it is a serious portion of his life after the age of thirty; that places of honour and trust are not generally obtained unsolicited. The same means that placed him there may be again made use of; his influence and his abilities arising from his opportunities, will, during the whole term encrease these means; he will have a compleat negative upon all laws that shall be general, or that shall favor individuals, and a voice in the appointment of all officers in the United States.—Thus habituated to power, and living in the daily practice of granting favors and receiving solicitations, he may hold himself compleatly independent of the people, and at the same time ensure his election. If there remains even a risque, the blessed assistance of a little well-distributed money, will remove it. With respect to the Executive, the Senate excepting in nomination, have a negative upon the President, and if we but a moment attend to their situation and to his, and to the power of persuasion over the human mind, especially when employed in behalf of friends and favorit[e]s, we cannot hesitate to say, that he will be infinitely less apt to disoblige them, than they to refuse him. It is far easier for twenty to gain over one, than one twenty; besides, in the one case, we can ascertain where the denial comes from, and the other we cannot. It is also highly improbable but some of the members, perhaps a major part, will hold their seats during their lives. We see it daily in our own Government, and we see it in every Government we are acquainted with, however many the cautions, and however frequent the elections. These considerations, added to their share above mentioned in the Executive department must give them a decided superiority over the House of Representatives.—But that superiority is greatly enhanced, when we consider the difference of time for which they are chosen. They will have become adepts in the mystery of administration, while the House of Representatives may be composed perhaps two thirds of members, just entering into office, little used to the course of business, and totally unacquainted with the means made use of to accomplish it.—Very possible also in a country where they are total strangers.—But, my fellow-citizens, the important question here arises, who are this House of Representatives? “A representative Assembly, says the celebrated Mr. Adams, is the sense of the people, and the perfection of the portrait, consists in the likeness.”2—Can this Assembly be said to contain the sense of the people?—Do they resemble the people in any one single feature?—Do you represent your wants, your grievances, your wishes, in person? If that is impracticable, have you a right to send one of your townsmen for that purpose?—Have you a right to send one from your county? Have you a right to send more than one for every thirty thousand of you? Can he be presumed knowing to your different, peculiar situations—your abilities to pay publick taxes, when they ought to be abated, and when encreased? Or is there any possibility of giving him information? All these questions must be answered in the negative. But how are these men to be chosen? Is there any other way than by dividing the State into districts? May not you as well at once invest your annual Assemblies with the power of choosing them—where is the essential difference? The nature of the thing will admit of none. Nay, you give them the power to prescribe the mode. They may invest it in themselves.—If you choose them yourselves, you must take them upon credit, and elect those persons you know only by common fame. Even this privilege is denied you annually, through fear that you [198]might withhold the shadow of controul over them. In this view of the System, let me sincerely ask you, where is the people in this House of Representatives?—Where is the boasted popular part of this much admired System?—Are they not couzin germans3 in every sense to the Senate? May they not with propriety be termed an Assistant Aristocratical Branch, who will be infinitely more inclined to co-operate and compromise with each other, than to be the careful guardians of the rights of their constituents? Who is there among you would not start at being told, that instead of your present House of Representatives, consisting of members chosen from every town, your future Houses were to consist of but ten in number, and these to be chosen by districts?—What man among you would betray his country and approve of it? And yet how infinitely preferable to the plan proposed?—In the one case the elections would be annual, the persons elected would reside in the center of you, their interests would be yours, they would be subject to your immediate controul, and nobody to consult in their deliberations—But in the other, they are chosen for double the time, during which, however well disposed, they become strangers to the very people choosing them, they reside at a distance from you, you have no controul over them, you cannot observe their conduct, and they have to consult and finally be guided by twelve other States, whose interests are, in all material points, directly opposed to yours. Let me again ask you, What citizen is there in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that would deliberately consent laying aside the mode proposed, that the several Senates of the several States, should be the popular Branch, and together, form one National House of Representatives?—And yet one moment’s attention will evince to you, that this blessed proposed Representation of the People, this apparent faithful Mirror, this striking Likeness, is to be still further refined, and more Aristocratical four times told.—Where now is the exact ballance which has been so diligently attended to? Where lies the security of the people? What assurances have they that either their taxes will not be exacted but in the greatest emergencies, and then sparingly, or that standing armies will be raised and supported for the very plausible purpose only of cantoning them upon their frontiers? There is but one answer to these questions.—They have none. Nor was it intended by the makers they should have, for meaning to make a different use of the latter, they never will be at a loss for ways and means to expend the former. They do not design to beg a second time. Knowing the danger of frequent applications to the people, they ask for the whole at once, and are now by their conduct, teazing and absolutely haunting of you into a compliance.—If you choose all these things should take place, by all means [199]gratify them. Go, and establish this Government, which is unanimously confessed imperfect, yet incapable of alteration. Intrust it to men, subject to the same unbounded passions and infirmities as yourselves, possessed with an insatiable thirst for power, and many of them, carrying in them vices, tho’ tinsel’d and concealed, yet, in themselves, not less dangerous than those more naked and exposed. But in the mean time, add an additional weight to the stone that now covers the remains of the Great WARREN and MONTGOMERY;4 prepare an apology for the blood and treasure, profusely spent to obtain those rights which you now so tamely part with. Conceal yourselves from the ridicule of your enemies, and bring your New-England spirits to a level with the contempt of mankind. Henceforth you may sit yourselves down with propriety, and say, Blessed are they that never expect, for they shall not be disappointed."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/8/1787,"SIR, I have proved, sir, that not only some power is given in the constitution to restrain, and even to subject the press, but that it is a power totally unlimited; and may certainly annihilate the freedom of the press, and convert it from being the palladium of liberty to become an engine of imposition and tyranny. It is an easy step from restraining the press to making it place the worst actions of government in so favorable a light, that we may groan under tyranny and oppression without knowing from whence it comes. But you comfort us by saying,—“there is no reason to suspect so popular a privilege will be neglected.” The wolf, in the fable, said as much to the sheep, when he was persuading them to trust him as their protector, and to dismiss their guardian dogs.1 Do you indeed suppose, Mr. Wilson, that if the people give up their privileges to these new rulers they will render them back again to the people? Indeed, sir, you should not trifle upon a question so serious—You would not have us to suspect any ill. If we throw away suspicion—to be sure, the thing will go smoothly enough, and we shall deserve to continue a free, respectable, and happy people. Suspicion shackles rulers and prevents good government. All great and honest politicians, like yourself, have reprobated it. Lord Mansfield is a great authority against it, and has often treated it as the worst of libels.2 But such men as Milton. Sidney, Locke, Montesquieu, and Trenchard, have thought it essential to the preservation of liberty against the artful and persevering encroachments of those with whom power is trusted. You will pardon me, sir, if [200]I pay some respect to these opinions, and wish that the freedom of the press may be previously secured as a constitutional and unalienable right, and not left to the precarious care of popular privileges which may or may not influence our new rulers. You are fond of, and happy at, quaint expressions of this kind in your observation—that a formal declaration would have done harm, by implying, that some degree of power was given when we undertook to define its extent. This thought has really a brilliancy in it of the first water. But permit me, sir, to ask, why any saving clause was admitted into this constitution, when you tell us, every thing is reserved that is not expressly given? Why is it said in sec. 9th, “The migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by Congress, prior to the year, 1808.” There is no power expressly given to the Congress to prohibit migrations and importations. By your doctrine then they could have none, and it was, according to your own position, nugatory to declare they should not do it. Which are we to believe, sir,—you or the constitution? The text, or the comment. If the former, we must be persuaded, that in the contemplation of the framers of the constitution implied powers were given, otherwise the exception would have been an absurdity. If we listen to you we must affirm it to be a distinctive characteristic of the constitution, that—“what is not expressly given is reserved.” Such are the inconsistenc[i]es into which men over ingenuous, like yourself, are betrayed in advocating a bad cause. Perhaps four months more consideration of the subject, would have rendered you more guarded.3 I come now to the consideration of the trial by jury in civil cases. And here you have, indeed, made use of your professional knowledge—But you did not tell the people that your profession was always to advocate one side of a question—to place it in the most favorable, though false, light—to rail where you could not reason—to pervert where you could not refute—and to practice every fallacy on your hearers—to mislead the understanding and pervert judgment. In light of this professional practice, you make a refutable objection of your own, and then triumphantly refute it. The objection you impute to your opponents is—the trial by jury is abolished in civil cases. This you call a disingenuous form—and truly it is very much so on your part and of your own fabrication. The objection in its true form is, that—trial by jury is not secured in civil cases. To this objection, you could not possibly give an answer; you therefore ingenuously coined one to which you could make a plausible reply. We expected, and we had a right to expect, that such an inestimable privilege as this would have been secured [201]—that it would not have been left dependent on the arbitrary exposition of future judges, who, when it may suit the arbitrary views of the ruling powers will explain it away at pleasure. We may expect Tressellians, Jeffrees’s, and Mansfield’s here,4 and if they should not be native with us, they may possibly be imported. But, if taken even on your own ground it is not so clearly tenable. In point of legal construction, the trial by jury does seem to be taken away in civil cases. It is a law maxim, that the expression of one part is an exclusion of the other. In legal construction therefore, the reservation of trial by jury in criminal, is an exclusion of it in civil cases. Why else should it be mentioned at all? Either it followed of course in both cases, or it depended on being stipulated. If the first, then the stipulation was nugatory—if the latter, then it was in part given up. Therefore, either we must suppose the Convention did a nugatory thing; or that by the express mention of jury in criminal, they meant to exclude it in civil cases. And that they did intend to exclude it, seems the more probable, as in the appeal they have taken special care to render the trial by jury of no effect by expressly making the court judges both of law and fact. And though this is subjected to the future regulation of Congress, yet it would be absurd to suppose, that the regulation meant its annihilation. We must therefore conclude, that in appeals the trial by jury is expressly taken away, and in original process it is by legal implication taken away in all civil cases. Here then I must repeat—that you ought to have stated fairly to the people, that the trial by jury was not secured; that they might know what, it was they were to consent to; and if knowing it, they consented, the blame could not fall on you. Before they decide, however, I will take leave to lay before them the opinion of that great and revered Judge Lord Camden,5 whose authority is, I hope, at least equal to that of Mr. Wilson.—“There is, says he, scarce any matter of challenge allowed to the judge, but several to the jurors, and many of them may be removed without any reason alledged. This seems to promise as much impartiality as human nature will admit, and absolute perfection is not attainable, I am afraid, either in judge or jury or any thing else. The trial by our country, is in my opinion, the great bulwark of freedom, and for certain, the admiration of all foreign writers and nations. The last writer of any distinguished note, upon the principles of government, the celebrated Montesquieu, is in raptures with this peculiar perfection in the English policy. From juries running riot, if I may say so, and acting wildly at particular seasons, I cannot conclude, like some Scottish Doctors of our law and constitutions, that their power [202]should be lessened. This would, to use the words of the wise, learned, and intrepid Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, be—a strange newfangled conclusion, after a trial so celebrated for so many hundreds of years.”6 Such are the opinions of Lord Camden and Vaughan, and multitudes of the first names, both English and other foreigners might be cited, who bestow unbounded approbation on this best of all human modes for protecting, life, liberty, and property. I own then, it alarms me, when I see these Doctors of our constitutions cutting in twain this sacred shield of public liberty and justice. Surely my countrymen will think a little before they resign this strong hold of freedom. Our state constitutions have held it sacred in all its parts. They have anxiously secured it. But that these may not shield it from the intended destruction in the new constitution, it is therein as anxiously provided, that “this constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme laws of the land; and the judges in every state, shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution and laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding.” Thus this new system, with one sweeping clause, bears down every constitution in the union, and establishes its arbitrary doctrines, supreme and paramount to all the bills and declarations of rights, in which we vainly put our trust, and on which we rested the security of our often declared, unalienable liberties. But I trust the whole people of this country, will unite, in crying out, as did our sturdy ancestors of old—Nolumus leges anglicæ mulari7—We will not part with our birthright."
Letter,No,William Grayson,William Short,,,11/10/1787,"I have recieved your favor, for which I am much obliged; the Convention, at Philada. about which I wrote you, have at length produced (contrary to expectation) an entire new constitution; This has put us all in an uproar.… In Delawar & Maryland I hear of little or no opposition; though in the latter some was expected from Chase & Paca. In Virginia there is a very considerable one; Ben. Harrisson Genl. Nessen,2 Patrick Henry, Thruston, Zane,3 Rich. H. Lee, & Co.—George Mason, most of the Judges of the Genl. Court cum multis aliis [i.e., along with many others] of the inferior flanking parties are inlisted as opponents: Genl. Washington however who is a host within himself is strongly in favor of it, & I am at a loss to determine how the matter will be ultimately closed.… With respect to my own sentiments I own I have important objections:—In the first place I think liberty a thing of too much importance to be trusted on the ground of implication: it should rest on principles [151page icon]expressed in the clearest & most unequivocal manner. A bill of rights ought then to have preceded, tryals by jury should have been expressly reserved in Civil as well as Criminal cases. The press ought to have been declared free—I think the federal Courts in the different states wrong—One Court at the session of Congress with appellative jurisdiction in the cases mentioned in the proposed constitution would have been sufficient. The presentation in the Senate ought to have been in the same proportion as the lower house, except in a few cases merely of a federal nature where the little States should be armed with a repulsive quality to preserve their own existence. The power of regulating commerce by a bare majority and that of taxing will ruin the Southern States; and the proposed method of making treaties i e, by two thirds of the Senators present will be the means of losing the Missisippi for ever:—Indeed we have had great difficulty to prevent it from destruction for two years past.— In these & several other instances which I could enumerate, I think the generarility will have too much power, but there are points where I don’t think they have power enough: In order to face foreign powers properly & to preserve their treaties & their faith with them, they should have had a negative upon the State laws with sevl other incidental powers—Witht. this I am satisfied, the new government if adopted will in a year or two be as contemptible as the present.—Upon the whole I look upon the new system as a most ridiculous piece of business—something (entre nouz) like the legs of Nebuchadnezar’s image: It seems to have been formed by jumbling or compressing a number of ideas together, something like the manner in which poems were made in Swift’s flying Island.4 How ever bad as it is, I believe it will be crammed down our throats rough & smooth with all it’s imperfections: the temper of America is changed beyond conception since you were here, & I believe they were ready to swallow almost any thing.… [N.B.] Inclosed are the papers of the day. You are not [to] suppose I mean to reflect on the members of the Convention: I highly respect the chief of them: but they could not act otherwise so circum[stanced?]."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,,11/15/1787,"SIR, Your speech has varnished an iron trap, ba[i]ted with some illustrious names, to catch the liberties of the people. And this you are pleased to call a constitution—“the best form of government that was ever offered to the world.” May Heaven then have mercy on the world [258]and on us. And in this prayer, I am persuaded, you will join me when you come to consider temperately, the unbounded powers given to this best of all possible governments; and then recollect, from your reading, what horrible abuses have grown from too unlimited a confidence of the people in their rulers. It is always both easier and safer, to add to powers, which are found to be insufficient, than to recall those which are injuriously large. This is a maxim, which no people, who mean to be free, should ever forget. While the people have something to give, they will be respected by their rulers. When with Cappadocian baseness,2 they resign all at once, they will be deemed fit only to be hewers of wood and drawers of water.3 In my former papers, I have shewn, that the freedom of the press is left at the mercy of the proposed government—that the sacred trial by jury, in civil cases, is at best doubtful; and in all cases of appeal expressly taken away. In equal insecurity, or rather equally at mercy, are we left as to—liberty of conscience. We find nothing that regards it, except the following;—“but no religious test shall every be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.” This exception implies, and necessarily implies, that in all other cases whatever liberty of conscience may be regulated. For, though no such power is expressly given, yet it is plainly meant to be included in the general powers, or else this exception would have been totally unnecessary—For why should it be said, that no religious test should be required as a qualification for office, if no power was given or intended to be given to impose a religious test of any kind? Upon the omission of the trial by jury in civil cases, you observe—“when this subject was in discussion, we were involved in difficulties which pressed on all sides, and no precedent could be discovered to direct our course. The cases open to trial by jury differed in the different states, it was therefore impracticable on that ground to have made a general rule.”—So, because the extent of the trial by jury varied in the different states, therefore it was proper to abolish it in all. For what else can your words—“it was impracticable to have made a general rule” mean?—If ever the rule is made, it must be general. And if this is impracticable—it surely follows, that in the fœderal court we must go without it in civil cases. What sense is there in supposing, that what, for the reasons you alledge, was impracticable with the Convention, will be practicable with the Congress? What faculty can the one body have more than the other, of reconciling contradictions? But the sophistry of this excuse consists in the word made—make you might not, but surely nothing hindered your proposing the general rule, which, if approved by the several state Conventions, would make the rule. You have made nothing. You have only [259]proposed. It rests with the several conventions, to make your propositions, rules. It is not possible to say, that the Convention could not have proposed, that there should be one similar general mode of trial by jury in the Fœderal court in all cases whatever. If the states would not have acceded to the proposition, we should only be where we are. And that this trial by jury is best, even in courts where the civil law process now prevails, I think no unbigoted man can doubt. Judge Blackstone is so explicit on this head, that I need only quote him to enforce conviction on every unprejudiced mind.—“This open examination of witnesses viva voce, in the presence of all mankind, is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth, than the private and secret examination taken down in writing before an officer, or his clerk, in the ecclesiastical courts, and all others that have borrowed their practice from the civil law; where a witness may frequently depose that in private which he will be ashamed to testify in a public and solemn tribunal. Where an artful or careless scribe may make a witness speak what he never meant, by dressing up his depositions in his own forms and language; but he is here at liberty to correct and explain his meaning, if misunderstood, which he can never do after a written deposition is once taken. Besides the occasional questions of the judge, the jury, and the counsel, propounded to the witnesses on a sudden, will sift out the truth much better than a formal set of interrogatories previously penned and settled; and the confronting of adverse witnesses is also another opportunity of obtaining a clear discovery, which can never be had on any other method of trial. Nor is the presence of the judge, during the examination, a matter of small importance; for besides the respect, &c. with which his presence will naturally inspire the witness, he is able by use and experience to keep the evidence from wandering from the point in issue. In short, by this method of examination, and this only, the persons who are to decide upon the evidence, have an opportunity of observing the quality, age, education, understanding, behaviour, and inclinations of the witness; in which points all persons must appear alike, when their depositions are reduced to writing and read to the judge, in the absence of those who made them; and yet as much may be frequently collected from the manner in which the evidence is delivered as from the matter of it. These are a few of the advantages attending this way of giving testimony oretenus; which was also, indeed, familiar among the ancient Romans.”4 They who applaud the practice of civil law courts, must either have seen very little of such practice not to know that it is liable to infinite fraud, corruption, and oppression. As far as it prevails in the English system of jurisprudence, from which we derive ours, it is a remnant of [260]ecclesiastical tyranny. The free and pure part of the system, that is the common law courts, have ever cautiously guarded against its encroachments, and restrained its operation. All great judges have reprobated it, except Lord Mansfield. He indeed, has been as desirous of extending it in England, as he was of extending parliamentary power into America; and with the same view—to establish tyranny. This noble Lord’s principles, if we may judge from the proposed constitution, has too many admirers in America. But I shall be told, that almost all the nations in Europe have adopted the civil law. This is true; and it is equally true, that almost all European nations have adopted arbitrary power with the civil law. This ought to be a warning to us how we admit it, even as England has done. It would never have been admitted there, but from the ecclesiastical influence in the days of superstition. This, thank Heaven, is now no more; and I sincerely wish its offspring was also extinct. I have been thus particular on the subject of civil law, to shew how little propriety there was in leaving it upon as respectable a foot, as the common law, in civil cases. In fact, the constitution leaves them both to shift for themselves, in original process, and in appeal seems to favor the former by placing both law and fact, in the arbitrament of the judges. Upon standing armies, sir, your professional dexterity has not abandoned you. The Constitution proposes to give the power of raising and supporting armies—and this without any limitation as to number; and to appropriate money to that object for two years at a time. This you justify by saying, that you “do not know a nation in the world which has not found it necessary and useful to maintain the appearance of strength, in a season of profound tranquility:” your knowledge then, sir, has not extended to free nations. Your phraseology, it is true, is somewhat equivocal; but unless by the term, appearance of strength, we understand, a standing army, we must suppose you to have meant a disingenuous evasion. Your reading might have informed you, sir,—that the Grecian republics, while free, never kept up any standing army—that the Roman republic, while free, never kept up a standing army, but that with them, a standing army and tyranny were co-eval, and concomitant—that in the free Swiss Cantons, no standing army, was ever, or is now permitted; no, sir, in all these great and glorious republics, though surrounded with enemies, their military array was occasional, or at the utmost, annual; nor was there formerly, nor is there now, in the Swiss Cantons, any more appearance of strength kept up in time of peace, than their militia gives: and yet they are free and formidable. You say a standing army has always been, “a topic of popular declamation.” Is it indeed nothing more, sir? Is that which all free nations have studiously avoided, as the rock on which their liberties would suffer shipwreck; that which in fact, is the source and security of tyranny; that which all great political writers concur in condemning; that which has animated the ardor, and inflamed the eloquence of the first orators in the two houses of parliament, in Great-Britain—that which all the art and influence of the crown could never obtain from the people for more than a year5—is all that, sir, nothing more but a topic of popular declamation? Is it surprising, that such knowledge, and such sentiments, as this declaration holds out, should have given us such a constitution? But the weightiest reason is, that without a standing army, “the government must declare war, before they are prepared to carry it on.” This is without question a most warlike paragraph: whether we are to invade Great-Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, or all together, under the new constitution, and with the standing army it has given, you have not been pleased to inform us. To do this, a navy too will be necessary, and I see no provision for that: however, I suppose that, as well as every thing else, is included in the power “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing, and all other powers vested by this constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.” Let then the people rightly understand, that one blessing of the constitution will be, the taxing them to support fleets and armies to conquer other nations, against whom the ambition of their new rulers may declare war."
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,11/19/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Place the Frame of Government proposed, in the most favorable point of view, magnify the priviledges held forth to the people to their fullest extent, and enlarge as much as you please, upon the great checks therein provided, notwithstanding all which, there cannot remain a doubt in the mind of any reflecting man, that it is a System purely Aristocratical, calculated to find employment for men of ambition, and to furnish means of sporting with the sacred principles of human nature. The great object throughout, is the acquisition of property and power, and every possible opportunity has been embraced to make ample provision for supplying a redundancy of the one, to exercise the other in its fullest extent. They have engrossed to themselves the riches of America, and are carefully silent what use they intend to put them to. Powers are there granted, that shall give to persons, greater strangers, and perhaps greater enemies to you than the people of Great-Britain, the right of entry into your habitations without your consent, not a lisp being mentioned as to the mode or time when such powers shall be exercised. They have taken to themselves the Purse and Sword of your country. Like the performance of a fine painter, the Senate is the subject of the piece painted.—The people with their priviledges, to an attentive observer, may be seen in the back ground, composing an insignificant part of the drapery, but their existence depends upon the freshness of the colours.—Frequent handling, a little exposure, and the smallest inroads of time upon these shades, will soon destroy them, and they will no longer be considered a part of the composition. If this is true—if in any future period, however distant, we are to be governed by One Branch, it surely behoves us to provide for an equal voice in that Branch, that our respective influence shall bear some small proportion to our respective contributions and numbers: Whereas in this System, equality is totally disregarded. Five pounds in the Senate has an equal voice with fifty, and about five hundred thousand of the inhabitants the same number of votes with the remaining three millions. Where then is the probability the rights of the people will find equal security? Is it not demonstrable that your burthens will be great in proportion as your influence in that body that imposes them is small? As it respects this Commonwealth, infinitely better would be our situation in a representation in the British Parliament. The terms offered us by our enemies [266]to place us as we stood in 1763, bear no comparison in their consequences, to those which would flow from the exercise of the powers of this Government by the Senate, as now constructed. If the same proportion in numbers and property had been observed in this Branch as in the House of Representatives (and no reason why it was not hath yet appeared, excepting what the celebrated Southern gentleman is pleased to term a “necessary compromise between contending interests[”])2 however successful they might be hereafter in arrogating all the powers of government to themselves, or however severe in executing them, still one gleam of hope with the spirit of consolation would be found in the breast of the subject, that his grievances were proportionate to those of his neighbours; but in the present case, even this satisfaction is denied him—the uncertainty is not left him—his reason instanter convinces him it is not so. It is idle to expect more virtue in an American than in an individual of any other nation.—That in opposition to all other countries, we are disposed in this, to live peaceably with each other, to consult our neighbours interest equally with our own, and to do to others as we should wish they should do to us. This being the case, we should not want any government.—Human nature is the same in all parts of the world, bad is the best: Education and example may tend to check or promote good or bad qualities, and encourage different degrees of vice. Some passions are more encreased by exercise in some countries than in others; but in all, the original stock is the same. We see in America the same vices, as abroad, and we are not backward in the practice of both wit and ingenuity in cultivating them. The pleasure of controul is palatable to all mankind without a single exception from the cradle to the throne. Let our peculiar situations be what they may, our proportion of happiness great, our domestic circles pleasing, our love of money unbounded, without a moment of suspence, still we are ready to risque the sacrifice of them all for a share in the exercise of power over our fellow creatures,—for the sake of governing others, instead of being governed ourselves; and the more we examine the conduct of those men who have been intrusted with the administration of governments, the more assured we shall be in our position, that mankind have perhaps in every instance abused the authority vested in them, or attempted the abuse of it. In considering the present Government before us, we therefore certainly ought to look upon those who are to put it in motion, as our enemies—to be careful what we give—to see what use it is to be put to—and where to resort for a remedy, if it is abused.—Every door unguardedly left open, they will take care we never shall hereafter shut—every link in the chain unrevitted, they will [267]provide shall always remain so.—It is of the last importance we set out right, we never can return to our present situation so well prepared to set out again. This institution once established will not wear wholly out for thousands of years.—It will not be easy for any single State to alter it by force of arms.—To guard against such attempts, will claim the earliest attention of our new Governours. To you, my fellow-citizens, let me now appeal: To you, who do not expect immediately to taste the sweets that flow from unlimited power, who determine upon principles that are immutable, who are not warped by private interest, and do not see through different mediums on different days—is there any among you who have had leisure to examine this Frame of Government, and without taking into consideration the powers granted therein, can say he approves of it—that he is pleased with the organization of the different branches, in their balances and their checks, that the people are fully and adequately represented, and let Human Nature be as depraved as Hell itself, (and we all know it is) yet the means provided to keep it within bounds are ample for the purposes?—I trust there is not one so passively disposed.—Indeed there cannot be, for it is grossly deficient in all these properties, it fails in a balance, and in a due seperation of the different departments—it totally fails in a fair, faithful, honest image of the people, and in an equality of representation, in the only powerful branch in it.—I feel a confidence that the good sense of the people of this Commonwealth, will secure a proper decision upon so important a subject. I feel animated, when I reflect, in what precious estimation they have held their liberties, from the settlement of their country to the present hour—with what ardour they have encountered distress, poverty and death, to preserve and secure them, and with what caution they have parted with even that proportion, which is necessary for the assistance of good order and society.—I go on further to contend, that though its frame was the best ever proposed to a people for their acceptance, and would last properly balanced for ages, yet powers are there given, more than are either fit or necessary in any case to be parted with.3 The extent of our country, with all its striking features, while they conspire to promote a federal union, are totally inconsistant with the plan of one Universal Empire, involving in it the destruction of the different State Governments.—I appeal to the most flaming zealots for the new Constitution, whether one of them, until the disclosure of the proceedings, entertained an idea, that the Convention would assume the power of internal taxation.—I dare affirm it was not lisped by an [268]individual, throughout the whole Continent. Among all the conversations respecting the sending of members to that Convention; even the claim over the excises was not started.—It was on the contrary, a point universally conceded, that had the impost been vested in Congress by the States at the time proposed, with powers to collect it, there never would have been an occasion for a Convention.4 That federal measures would have taken a favourable turn, and with the proceeds of that revenue, Congress would have been able to have supported her own household, paid the interest of her domestic debt, and the different instalments, and interest of her foreign. But now these same Gentlemen, despising every civil institution yet adopted in America, and finding the form of Government far more grateful to their ambitious spirits than they ever imagined, will tell you, that the existance of the Continent depends upon its adoption—that we are ruined and undone, if we do not cordially embrace it, but if we do, like the ingenious dentist, it will pull from the breast of every citizen, all his jarring, malevolent passions, making us a wise, virtuous and wealthy people, and though they do not in plain words say that the millennium is to commence on its birth day; yet they describe to you, all the blessed effects expectant upon such an era. A dry tax is at all times odious. It is not congenial to the feelings of a free people. It is a visible demand upon a man at noon day, of that which he prefers to his life. He is called upon, when the necessity of giving it to support the society he lives in, does not strike him so forceably;—he for ever parts with it with reluctance, and would never consent, but under a conviction, that it is absolutely necessary—that it is his proportion—that it will be properly applied, and is laid upon him by his neighbour, chosen by himself, whom he controuls, and who bears an equal share of the same burthen.—It is a science difficult in its nature, duly to assess it. A man must not only be knowing to the different circumstances of every individual, the value of his real and personal estate—but also must be without passions, without prejudices, without connections, making it his whole business. This not being the case, produces heart burnings, evasions, false oaths, unequal assessments, delays of payment, and finally, inability. These inconveniences are still increased by the mode of collecting the tax when so assessed. This trust is placed, in general, in persons who have neither knowledge or discretion equal to the importance of it. An opportunity is put into their hands to gratify all their little prejudices and resentments. They will unreasonably press upon one, and at the same moment indulge another. Unused to handle large sums of money, they cannot help fingering untill they think it their own—They misapply first a small proportion, one extravagance leads to another, until they are in arrears [269]when called upon—and the honest and industrious are obliged again to contribute to supply their deficiencies.—This is the operation of a dry tax in its best situation; and it serves to demonstrate, that taxation and representation are inseperable—that they never can be laid upon the subject but by himself, or his representative, not treble refined, but resident in his vicinity, who shall be conversant both in his ability as to quantum, and propriety as to time. Even then they ought not be resorted to, but in the last extremity, for surely this Commonwealth will not be backward to testify, that notwithstanding they have made the experiment under the most promising circumstances, still woeful experience demonstrates the utter impossibility of raising and collecting monies sufficient for the use of government in such an odious, unequal manner. The five taxes past, in their consequences, have introduced idleness, dissipation, fraud, discontent, bankruptcies, unlawful speculations, stock-jobbing, and every other vice incident to our species, without supplying the Treasury with scarce a farthing. Government have always demonstrated a disposition to ease the people in the payment as much as in their power, notwithstanding which no one single person is satisfied, Government itself almost destroyed in consequence, and the end proposed in no one shape answered. If then, my fellow citizens, it is so easily demonstrated that dry taxes are attended with such fatal consequences, when we impose them ourselves, that the evils accompanying the collection of them in the best given circumstances, overbalance all the advantages accruing from the monies raised by such collections.—What reason have you to suppose that a Continental tax will be more beneficial in its consequences, more equal in its assessments, and milder in its mode of collection. A man must be distracted to suppose so, for there are no avenues open for either of those consequences to flow through. In the first instance, the sum will be laid upon you by people that cannot be sufficiently acquainted with your country. A new set of Continental pensioned Assessors will be introduced into your towns, whose interest will be distinct from yours.—They will be joined by another set of Continental Collectors, still less principled and less adequate than the former. Attempts will be made by interested men upon their integrity, and instances of their deviations will be daily before your eyes.—At a distance from their employers and removed from the Seat of Government, you will see them exulting with ideas, that they can practice their oppression upon you with impunity, and in their rioting and debauchery they will squander the proceeds of your industry.—The extremes of tyranny are commonly at the extreme parts of the country governed. You must kiss the rod, or they will make you feel it.—According to the spirit of obedience which you [270]manifest; to the ease with which you part with your money, so will the mode of assessing and collecting it be varied from time to time by your new masters. If one man shall not be competent, he shall be attended with an host.—Whether that host shall be the posse of your country or a file of armed soldiers, shall depend upon circumstances. They are to determine, and you are to make no laws inconsistent with such determination, whether such Collectors shall carry with them any paper, purporting their commission, or not—whether it shall be a general warrant, or a special one—whether written or printed—whether any of your goods, or your persons shall be exempt from distress, and in what manner either you or your property is to be treated when taken in consequence of such warrants. They will have the liberty of entering your houses by night as well as by day for such purposes.—All these points are given in letter and in spirit to the New Constitution, and the subject has not a shadow of security that they will not be executed.—Nay, if they ever should mean to exercise the right of taxation at all, I affirm it can be done with success by them in no other way, but in an arbitrary manner, and by previously subduing the spirit and strength of this Commonwealth. In forming our own Constitution, by persons having one common interest, we deemed it of consequence, to preface such powers, with the mode in which they should be exercised.—We thought it highly proper to declare “That every subject had a right to be secured from all unreasonable searches and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions—that all warrants were contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation, and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, be not accompanied with a special designation,”5 &c. &c. &c.—These checks are omitted, however, in the present proceedings, and the sole reason why appears to be this, that the makers of them know the power itself to be improper, that the people would always be convinced of that impropriety, and would never submit, so long as they could resist.—That of course it must be collected without these checks, or not collected at all. These are serious thoughts.—They may by some be called bugbears; but they will be verified in the future history of America, with a vengeance.—That it will be in five, ten or fifteen years is not probable. Your rulers will be too knowing, to be over hasty in a display of their strength; they will not loose ground so easily as the Court of Great-Britain did for want of a little well timed policy.—Your chains will be gradual, and gilded. But finally they will be as visible as the Summer’s Sun in the Meridian. Where is the Government under Heaven, where [271]every farthing is not taken from the people, that they possibly can part with.—It must be the case here. Their interest will point out to them the policy in accustoming you to contributions, and their curiosity will be early excited to make the experiment to constitute a thermometer for your feelings.—They will have a plausible pretext.—They will tell you your burthens will be less when you get out of debt, and that they are the effect of not adopting it sooner.—They have large demands upon them, and matters of moment to undertake. The officers of their Government will be encreased an hundred fold, and the liberality with which they have expended their money in salaries plainly evinces the improbability that there ever will be a great sum lying idle in their treasury. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,George Mason,,Massachusetts Centinel,,11/21/1787,"There is no declaration of rights, and of the laws of the general government being paramount to the laws and constitutions of the several States, the declarations of rights in the seperate States are no security. Nor are the people secured even in the enjoyment of the benefit of the common law, which stands here upon no other foundation than its having been adopted by the respective acts forming the Constitutions of the several States. In the House of Representatives there is not the substance, but the shadow only of representation; which can never produce proper information in the Legislature, or inspire confidence in the people; the laws will therefore be generally made by men little concerned in, and unacquainted with their effects and consequences.(a) The Senate have the power of altering all money bills, and of originating appropriations of money, and the salaries of the officers of their own appointment, in conjunction with the President of the United States; although they are not the Representatives of the people, or amenable to them.—These, with their other great powers (viz. their powers in the appointment of Ambassadours, and all publick officers, in making treaties, and in trying all impeachments) their influence upon and connection with the Supreme Executive from these causes, their duration of office, and their being a constant existing body almost continually setting, joined with their being one compleat branch of the Legislature, will destroy any balance in the government, and enable them to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and liberties of the people. The Judiciary of the United States is so constructed and extended, as to absorb and destroy the Judiciaries of the several States; thereby rendering law as tedious, intricate and expensive, and justice as unattainable by a great part of the community, as in England; and enabling the rich to oppress and ruin the poor. The President of the United States has no Constitutional Council (a thing unknown in any safe and regular government) he will therefore be unsupported by proper information and advice; and will generally be directed by minions and favourites—or he will become a tool to the Senate—or a Council of State will grow out of the principal officers of the great departments; the worst and most dangerous of all ingredients for such a Council, in a free country; for they may be induced to join in any dangerous or oppressive measures, to shelter themselves, and prevent an inquiry into their own misconduct in office: Whereas had a constitutional council been formed (as was proposed) of six members, viz. two from the eastern, two from the middle, and two from the southern States, to be appointed by vote of the States in the House of Representatives, with the same duration and rotation of office as the Senate, the Executive would always have had safe and proper information and advice: The President of such a Council might have acted as Vice-President of the United States, pro tempore, upon any vacancy or disability of the Chief Magistrate; and long continued sessions of the Senate would in a great measure have been prevented. From this fatal defect of a constitutional council has arisen the improper power of the Senate, in the appointment of publick officers, and the alarming dependence and connection between that branch of the Legislature and the Supreme Executive. Hence also sprung that unnecessary and dangerous officer, the Vice-President, who for want of other employment, is made President of the Senate; thereby dangerously blending the Executive and Legislative powers; besides always giving to some one of the States an unnecessary and unjust preeminence over the others. The President of the United States has the unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason; which may be sometimes exercised to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt. By declaring all treaties supreme laws of the land, the Executive and the Senate have in many cases, an exclusive power of Legislation; which might have been avoided, by proper distinctions with respect to treaties, and requiring the assent of the House of Representatives, where it could be done with safety. Under their own construction of the general clause at the end of the enumerated powers, the Congress may grant monopolies in trade and commerce, constitute new crimes, inflict unusual [290]and severe punishment, and extend their power as far as they shall think proper; so that the State Legislatures have no security for the powers now presumed to remain to them; or the people for their rights. There is no declaration of any kind for preserving the liberty of the press, the trial by jury in civil causes, nor against the danger of standing armies in time of peace. The State Legislatures are restrained from laying export duties on their own produce—the general legislature is restrained from prohibiting the further importation of slaves for twenty odd years, though such importations render the United States weaker, more vulnerable, and less capable of defence.—Both the general legislature, and the state legislatures, are expressly prohibited making expost facto laws, though there never was, nor can be a legislature but must and will make such laws, when necessity and the publick safety require them; which will hereafter be a breach of all the Constitutions in the union, and afford precedents for other innovations. This government will commence in a moderate aristocracy, it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will, in its operation, produce a monarchy, or a corrupt oppressive aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other. (a) This objection has been in some degree lessened, by an amendment, often before refused, and at last made by an erasure, after the engrossment upon parchment, of the word forty, and inserting thirty, in the 3d clause of the 2d section of the 1st article."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/22/1787,"SIR, The public appear to me, sir, to be much indebted to you, for informing them; for what purpose a power was given by the proposed Constitution, of raising and supporting armies.—Some, indeed, might have suspected, that such a power, uncontrouled by any declaration, that the military should always be subject to the civil power, might be intended for the purposes of ambition. Your declaration has removed all doubt. Every principle of policy, you say, would be subverted unless we kept up armies—for what—for our defence?—no,—to support declarations of war—to strike home, with dispatch and secrecy, before the [282]enemy can be apprized of your intention. Upon the same principle a small army would be ridiculous. Nothing less than the Prussian number, about 200,000 men would embrace this salutary object. And as you now say—“no man that regards the dignity and safety of his country can deny the necessity of a military force.”—You will next affirm, that no one, for the same reason, can deny the necessity of a large army. The safety of the country, we have already experienced to depend, upon the militia. Switzerland has often experienced the same. Why then, sir, should you be so very positive, that for this purpose a military force is necessary?—But for the dignity of the country, that is for the ambition of its rulers, armies I confess are necessary; and not less in number than other ambitious rulers maintain, by grinding the face of the people. For every thousand in these armies a million of dollars must be levied upon the public, and such armies—raised and supported, would at once maintain the dignity of government, and ensure the submission of the people. We shall be as dignified as the Turks, and equally free.—The sole power of voting men, and money, is retained by the representative of the people in England. This is their shield and their defence against arbitrary power. Never has the King been able to obtain the extension of this vote beyond a year. But we are called upon, with all the solemnity of a constitutional act, to give it up for two years. And yet, sir, you talk of the controul and the restrictions which the new Constitution provides. There is, I confess, some dexterity in the negative terms in which this power is conceived—not more than two years. But what the Constitution permits, and what it grants are essentially the same. And since it seemed necessary to this almost all confiding Convention, to limit our confidence in this particular, the only rule that observation suggests is, that of England; where this confidence has never exceeded one year. I come now, sir, to the most exceptionable part of the Constitution—the senate. In this, as in every other part, you are in the line of your profession, and on that ground assure your fellow citizens, that—“perhaps there never was a charge made with less reason, than that which predicts the institution of a baneful aristocracy in the Federal Senate.” And yet your conscience smote you, sir, at the beginning, and compelled you to prefix a—perhaps to this strange assertion. The senate, you say, branches into two characters—the one legislative and the other executive. This phraseology is quaint, and the position does not state the whole truth. I am very sorry, sir, to be so often obliged to reprehend the suppression of information at the moment that you stood forth to instruct your fellow citizens, in what they were supposed not to understand. In this character, you should have abandoned your professional [283]line, and told them, not only the truth, but the whole truth. The whole truth then is, that the same body, called the senate, is vested with—legislative—executive—and judicial powers. The two first you acknowlege; the last is conveyed in these words, sec. 3d. The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. On this point then we are to come to issue—whether a senate so constituted is likely to produce a baneful aristocracy, which will swallow up the democratic rights and liberties of the nation. To judge on this question, it is proper to examine minutely into the constitution and powers of the senate; and we shall then see with what anxious and subtle cunning it is calculated for the proposed purpose. 1st. It is removed from the people, being chosen by the legislatures—and exactly in the ratio of their removal from the people, do aristocratic principles constantly infect the minds of man. 2d. They endure, two thirds for four, and one third for six years, and in proportion to the duration of power, the aristocratic exercise of it, and attempts to extend it, are invariably observed to increase. 3d. From the union of the executive with the legislative functions, they must necessarily be longer together, or rather constantly assembled; and in proportion to their continuance together, will they be able to form effectual schemes for extending their own power, and reducing that of the democratic branch. If any one would wish to see this more fully illustrated, let him turn to the history of the Decemviri in Rome.1 4th. Their advice and consent being necessary to the appointment of all the great officers of state, both at home and abroad, will enable them to win over any opponents to their measures in the house of representatives, and give them the influence which, we see, accompanies this power in England; and which, from the nature of man, must follow it every where. 5th. The sole power of impeachment being vested in them, they have it in their power to controul the representative in this high democratic right; to screen from punishment, or rather from conviction, all high offenders, being their creatures, and to keep in awe all opponents to their power in high office. 6th. The union established between them and the vice president, who is made one of the corps, and will therefore be highly animated with the aristocratic spirit of it, furnishes them a powerful shield against popular suspicion and enquiry, he being the second man in the United States who stands highest in the confidence and estimation of the people. And lastly, the right of altering or amending money-bills, is a high additional power given them as a branch of the legislature, which their analogous branch, in the English parliament, could never obtain, because it has been guarded by the representatives of the people there, with the most strenuous solicitude as one of the vital principles of democratic liberty. Is a body so vested with means to soften & seduce—so armed with power to screen or to condemn—so fortified against suspicion and enquiry—so largely trusted with legislative powers—so independent of and removed from the people—so tempted to abuse and extend these powers—is this a body which freemen ought ever to create, or which freemen can ever endure? Or is it not a monster in the political creation, which we ought to regard with horror? Shall we thus forge our own fetters? Shall we set up the idol, before which we shall soon be obliged, however, reluctantly to bow? Shall we consent to see a proud aristocracy erect his domineering crest in triumph over our prostrate liberties? But we shall yet see more clearly, how highly favored this senate has been, by taking a similar view of the representative body. This body is the true representative of the democratic part of the system; the shield and defence of the people. This body should have weight from its members, and the high controul which it should alone possess. We can form no idea of the necessary number in this untried system, to give due weight to the democratic part, but from the example of England. Had it not been intended to humble this branch, it would have been fixed, at least, at their standard. We are to have one representative for every thirty thousand—they have nearly one for ten thousand souls. Their number is about six millions; their representatives five hundred and fifteen. When we are six millions, we shall have only two hundred representatives. In point of number therefore and the weight derived from it, the representative proposed by the constitution is remarkably feeble. It is farther weakened by the senate being allowed not only to reject, but to alter and amend money-bills. Its transcendent and incommunicable power of impeachment—that high source of its dignity and controul—in which alone the majesty of the people feels his sceptre, and bears aloft his fasces—is rendered ineffectual, by its being triable before its rival branch, the senate, the patron and prompter of the measures against which it is to sit in judgment. It is therefore most manifest, that from the very nature of the constitution the right of impeachment apparently given, is really rendered ineffectual. And this is contrived with so much art, that to discover it you must bring together various and distant parts of the constitution, or it will not strike the examiner, that the same body that advises the executive measures of government which are usually the subject of impeachment, are the sole judges on such impeachments. They must therefore be both party and judge, and must condemn those who have executed what they advised. Could such a monstrous absurdity have escaped men who were not determined, at all events, to vest all power in this aristocratic body? Is it not plain, that [285]the senate is to be exalted by the humiliation of the democracy. A democracy which, thus bereft of its powers, and shorn of its strength; will stand a melancholy monument of popular impotence. Hitherto I have examined your senate by its intrinsic and its comparative powers. Let us next examine, how far the principles of its constitution are compatible with what our own constitutions lay down, and what the best writers on the subject have determined to be essential to free and good government. In every state constitution, with a very trifling exception in that of Massachusetts, the legislative and executive powers are vested in different and independent bodies.—Will any one believe, that it is because we are become wiser, that in twelve years we are to overthrow every system which reason and experience taught us was right. Or is it, that a few men, forming a plan at Philadelphia subversive of all former principles, then posting to Congress, and passing it there, and next dispersing themselves in the several states to propagate their errors, and, if they can, get chosen into the state conventions; are actuated by motives of interest and bad ambition? I should be very unwilling to believe the latter, and yet it is utterly incomprehensible, how such a systematic violation of all that has been deemed wise and right, from which no other result can be expected, but the establishment of a baneful aristocracy, could have been recommended to a free and enlightened people. “Lorsque dans la meme personne, says Montesquieu, ou dans le meme corps de magistrature, la puissance legislative est re-unie a la puissance executive; il n’y a point de liberte; parce qu’on peut craindre que le meme monarque, ou le meme Senat ne fasse des loix tyranniques, pour les executer tyranniquement.” “When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same corps, there can be no liberty. Because, it may be feared, that the same monarch or senate will make tyrannical laws, that, they may execute them tyrannically.”2 I am aware that this great man is speaking of a senate being the whole legislative; whereas the one before us is but a branch of the proposed legislature. But still the reason applies, inasmuch as the legislative power of the senate will enable it to negative all bills that are meant to controul the executive, and from being secure of preventing any abridgment, they can watch every pliant hour of the representative body to promote an enlargement of the executive powers. One thing at least is certain, that by making this branch of the legislature participant in the executive, you not only prevent the legislature from being a check upon the executive, but you inevitably prevent its being checked or controuled by the other branch. To the authority of Montesquieu, I shall add that of Mr. de Lolme; whose disquisition on government, is allowed to be deep, solid, and ingenious. [“]Il ne suffisoit pas, says he, d’oter aux legislateurs l’execution des loix, par consequent, l’exemption qui en est la suite immediate; il falloit encore, leur oter ce qui eut produit les memes effects—l’espoir de jamais se l’attribuer[”]—[“]It is not only necessary to take from the legislature the executive power which would exempt them from the laws; but they should not have even a hope of being ever able to arrogate to themselves that power.”3 To remove this hope from their expectation, it would have been proper, not only to have previously laid down, in a declaration of rights, that these powers should be forever separate and incommunicable; but the frame of the proposed constitution, should have had that separation religiously in view, through all its parts. It is manifest this was not the object of its framers, but, that on the contrary there is a studied mixture of them in the senate as necessary to erect it into that potent aristocracy which it must infallibly produce. In pursuit of this darling object, than which no greater calamity can be brought upon the people, another egregious error in constitutional principles is committed. I mean that of dividing the executive powers, between the senate and the president. Unless more harmony and less ambition should exist between these two executives than ever yet existed between men in power, or than can exist while human nature is as it is: this absurd division must be productive of constant contentions for the lead, must clog the execution of government to a mischievous, and sometimes to a disgraceful degree, and if they should unhappily harmonize in the same objects of ambition, their number and their combined power, would preclude all fear of that responsibility, which is one of the great securities of good, and restraints on bad governments. Upon these principles M. de Lolme has foreseen that “the effect of a division of the executive power is the establishment of absolute power in one of continual contention”; he therefore lays it down, as a general rule “pour q’un etat soit tranquille il faut que le pouvoir executif y soit rèunie”—for the tranquillity of the state it is necessary that the executive power should be in one.4 I will add, that this singlehood of the executive, is indispensably necessary to effective execution, as well as to the responsibility and rectitude of him to whom it is entrusted. By this time I hope it is evident from reason and authority, that in the constitution of the senate there is much cunning and little wisdom; that we have much to fear from it, and little to hope, and then it must necessarily produce a baneful aristocracy, by which the democratic rights of the people will be overwhelmed. [287] It was probably upon this principle that a member of the convention, of high and unexceeded reputation for wisdom and integrity, is said to have emphatically declared, that he would sooner lose his right hand, than put his name to such a constitution:5"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/23/1787,"TO THE PEOPLE. Many inconveniencies and difficulties in the new plan of government have been mentioned by different writers on that subject. Mr. Gerry has given the publick his objections against it, with a manly freedom. The seceding members from the Pennsylvania Assembly also published theirs.2 Various anonymous writers have mentioned reasons of great weight. Among the many objections have been stated the unlimited right of taxation—a standing army—an inadequate representation of the people—a right to destroy the constitution of the separate states, and all the barriers that have been set up in defence of liberty—the right to try causes between private persons in many cases without a jury; without trying in the vicinity of either party; and without any limitation of the value which is to be tried. To none of these or any other objections has any answer been given, but such as have acknowledged the truth of the objection while they insulted the objector. This conduct has much the appearance of trying to force a general sentiment upon the people. The idea of promoting the happiness of the people by opposing all their habits of business and by subverting the laws to which they are habituated, appears to me to be at least a mistaken proceeding. If to this we add the limitations of trade, restraints on its freedom, and the alteration of its course, and transfer of the market, all under the pretence of regulation for federal purposes, we shall not find any additional reason to be pleased with the plan. It is now conceded on all sides that the laws relating to civil causes were never better executed than at present. It is confessed by a warm federalist in answer to mr. Gerry’s sensible letter, that the courts are so arranged at present that no inconvenience is found, and that if the new plan takes place great difficulties may arise.3 With this confession [305]before him, can any reasonable man doubt whether he shall exchange a system, found by experience to be convenient, for one that is in many respects inconvenient, and dangerous? The expense of the new plan is terrifying, if there was no other objection. But they are multiplied. Let us consider that of the representation. There is to be one representative for every thirty thousand people. Boston would nearly send one, but with regard to another there is hardly a county in the state which would have one. The representatives are to be chosen for two years. In this space, when it is considered that their residence is from two hundred to five miles from their constituents, it is difficult to suppose that they will retain any great affection for the welfare of the people. They will have an army to support them, and may bid defiance to the clamours of their subjects. Should the people cry aloud the representative may avail himself of the right to alter the time of election and postpone it for another year. In truth, the question before the people is, whether they will have a limited government or an absolute one? It is a fact justified by the experience of all mankind from the earliest antiquity down to the present time, that freedom is necessary to industry. We accordingly find that in absolute governments, the people, be the climate what it may, are [in] general lazy, cowardly, turbulent, and vicious to an extreme. On the other hand, in free countries are found in general, activity, industry, arts, courage, generosity, and all the manly virtues. Can there be any doubt which to choose? He that hesitates must be base indeed. A favourite objection against a free government is drawn from the irregularities of the Greek and Roman republicks. But it is to be considered that war was the employment which they considered as most becoming freemen. Agriculture, arts, and most domestick employment were committed chiefly to slaves. But Carthage, the great commercial republick of antiquity, though resembling Rome in the form of its government, and her rival for power, retained her freedom longer than Rome, and was never disturbed by sedition during the long period of her duration. This is a striking proof that the fault of the Greek and Roman republicks was not owing to the form of their government; and that the spirit of commerce is the great bond of union among citizens. This furnishes employment for their activity, supplies their mutual wants, defends the rights of property, and producing reciprocal dependencies, renders the whole system harmonious and energetick. Our great object therefore ought to be to encourage this spirit. If we examine the present state of the world we shall find that most of the [306]business is done in the freest states, and that industry decreases in proportion to the rigour of government."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/27/1787,"To the PEOPLE of MASSACHUSETTS. In the Gazette of the 23d instant,2 I ascertained, from the state of other countries and the experience of mankind, that free countries are most friendly to commerce and to the rights of property. This produces greater internal tranquillity. For every man, finding sufficient employment for his active powers in the way of trade, agriculture and manufactures, feels no disposition to quarrel with his neighbour, nor with the government which protects him, and of which he is a constituent part. Of the truth of these positions we have abundant evidence in the history of our own country. Soon after the settlement of Massachusetts, and its formation into a commonwealth, in the earlier part of the last century, there was a sedition at Hingham and Weymouth. The governour passing by at that time with his guard, seized some of the mutineers and imprisoned them. This was complained of as a violation of [323]their rights, and the governour lost his election the next year; but the year afterwards was restored, and continued to be re-elected for several years.3 The government does not appear to have been disturbed again till the revocation of the charter in 1686, being a period of about half a century. Connecticut set out originally on the same principles, and has continued uniformly to exercise the powers of government to this time. During the last year, we had decisive evidences of the vigour of this kind of government. In Connecticut, the treason was restrained while it existed only in the form of conspiracy. In Vermont, the conspirators assembled in arms, but were suppressed by the exertions of the militia, under the direction of their sheriffs. In New-Hampshire, the attack was made on the legislature, but the insurrection was in a very few hours suppressed, and has never been renewed.4 In Massachusetts, the danger was, by delay, suffered to increase. One judicial court after another was stopped, and even the capital trembled. Still, however, when the supreme executive gave the signal, a force of many thousands of active, resolute men, took the field, during the severities of winter, and every difficulty vanished before them. Since that time we have been continually coalescing. The people have applied with diligence to their several occupations, and the whole country wears one face of improvement. Agriculture has been improved, manufactures multiplied, and trade prodigiously enlarged. These are the advantages of freedom in a growing country. While our resources have been thus rapidly increasing, the courts have set in every part of the commonwealth, without any guard to defend them; have tried causes of every kind, whether civil or criminal, and the sheriffs, have in no case been interrupted in the execution of their office. In those cases indeed, where the government was more particularly interested, mercy has been extended, but in civil causes, and in the case of moral offences, the law has been punctually executed. Damage done to individuals, during the tumults, has been repaired, by judgment of the courts of law, and the award has been carried into effect. This is the present state of affairs, when we are asked to relinquish that freedom which produces such happy effects. The attempt has been made to deprive us of such a beneficial system, and to substitute a rigid one in its stead, by criminally alarming our fears, exalting certain characters on one side, and villifying them on the other. I wish to say nothing of the merits or demerits of individuals; such arguments always do hurt. But assuredly my countrymen cannot fail to consider and determine who are the most worthy of confidence in a business of this magnitude:—Whether they will trust persons, who have, from their cradles, been incapable of comprehending any other [324]principles of government, than those of absolute power, and who have, in this very affair, tried to deprive them of their constitutional liberty, by a pitiful trick. They cannot avoid prefer[r]ing those who have uniformly exerted themselves to establish a limited government, and to secure to individuals all the liberty that is consistent with justice, between man and man, and whose efforts, by the smiles of Providence, have hitherto been crowned with the most splendid success. After the treatment we have received, we have a right to be jealous, and to guard our present constitution with the strictest care. It is the right of the people to judge, and they will do wisely to give an explicit instruction to their delegates in the proposed convention, not to agree to any proposition that will, in any degree, militate with that happy system of government under which Heaven has placed them. November 24, 1787"
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,James Wilson,11/29/1787,"Sir, In my former observations on your speech, to your fellow-citizens,1 explanatory and defensive of the new constitution; it has appeared, by arguments to my judgment unanswerable, that by ratifying the constitution, as the convention proposed it, the people will leave the liberty of the press, and the trial by jury, in civil cases, to the mercy of their rulers—that the project is to burthen them with enormous taxes, in order to raise and maintain armies, for the purposes of ambition and arbitrary power—that this power is to be vested in an aristocratic senate, who will either be themselves the tyrants, or the support of tyranny, in a president, who will know how to manage them, so as to make that body at once the instrument and the shield of his absolute authority.—Even the Roman Emperors found it necessary to have a senate for this purpose. To compass this object, we have seen powers, in every branch of government, in violation of all principle, and all safety condensed in this aristocratic senate: we have seen the representative, or democratic branch, weakened exactly in proportion to the strength[en]ing the aristocratic, or, what means the same thing, and will be more pleasing to your ear, Mr. Wilson, the republican branch. We have seen with what cunning the power of impeachment is apparently given to the representative of the people, but really to the senate; since, as they advise these measures of government, which experience has shewn, are the general matters of impunity the executive officers will be sure of impeachment when they act in conformity to their will. Impeachment will therefore have no terrors, but for those who displease or oppose the senate. Let us suppose that the privy councils who advise the executive government in England, were vested with the sole power of trying impeachments; would any man say that this would not render that body absolute; and impeachment to all popular purposes, negatory? I shall appeal to those very citizens, Mr. Wilson, whom you was misleading, for the propriety of what I am going to observe. They know that their constitution was democratic—that it secured the powers of government in the body of the people. They have seen an aristocratical party rise up against this constitution, and without the aid of such a senate, but from the mere influence of wealth, however unduly obtained, they have seen this aristocracy, under the originatical title of republicans, procure such a preference in the legislature, as to appoint a majority of the state members in the late convention, out of their body.2 Had such a senate, as they have now proposed, been part of your constitution, [321]would the popular part of it, have been in effect more than a name. Can your fellow citizens then doubt that these men planned this senate, to effect the very purpose which has been the constant object of their endeavors, that is to overthrow the present constitution. And can you, O citizens of Philadelphia, so soon forget the constitution which you formed, for which you fought, which you have solemnly engaged to defend—can you so soon forget all this, as to be the willing ministers of that ambition, which aims only at making you its footstool—the confirmers of that constitution, which gives your aristocratic enemies their wish, and must trample your state constitution in the dust. Reflect a moment—who wish to erect an aristocracy among you—Mr. Wilson and his party; who were your delegates in framing the constitution now proposed to you—Mr. Wilson, and his party; who harangues you to smooth its passage to your approbation—Mr. Wilson; who have you chosen to approve of it in your state convention—Mr. Wilson.—O sense where is your guard! shame where is your blush3 the intention of a state convention is, that a work of so great moment to your welfare, should undergo an examination by another set of men, uninfluenced by partiality or prejudice in its favor. And for this purpose you are weak enough to send a man, who was in the former convention, and who has not only signed his approbation of it, but stands forward as an agitator for it: is this man unprejudiced? would any man who did not suffer party to overcome all sense of rectitude, solicit or accept so improper a trust? He knows, in the line of his profession, that the having given an opinion upon the same question is a constant ground of challenge to a juryman. And does he think that this question is of less importance and ought less to be guarded against partiality and prejudice, than a common jury cause? He knows that a conscientious man will not sit as a juryman twice on the same cause: and is he in this most momentous cause, less conscientious than a common juryman? What are we to expect from the work of such hands? But you must permit me to lay before you, from your own transactions, farther proofs of Mr. Wilson’s consistency, and of his sacred attention to your rights, when he counsels you to adopt the new constitution. You know that he was one of the convention that formed, and recommended to you, your state constitution. Read what is there laid down as a fundamental principle of liberty—“As standing armies, in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up.”4 Read now what this identical Mr. Wilson says to you in his speech—“This constitution, it has been farther urged, is of a pernicious tendency, because it tolerates a standing army in time of peace. This has always been a topic of popular declamation, and yet I do not know a nation [322]in the world, which has not found it necessary and useful to maintain the appearance of strength, in a season of the most profound peace.” What a change of tone is here.—Formerly the mischief of standing armies was of sufficient moment, to find a place in a most solemn recognition of the fundamental rights of the people; standing armies were dangerous to liberty; but now they are only a topic of popular declamation, and are both useful and necessary in a season of the most profound tranquility:—O citizens of Philadelphia! do your hear, do you read, do you reflect? can you believe that the man means either wisely or honestly, who thus palpably contradicts himself, who treats with such levity, what your constitution declares to be one of your most sacred rights; and who betrays so little knowledge of ancient and modern history, as not to know, that some of the freest republics in the world, never kept up a standing army in time of peace! Can you, O deluded men, not see that the object of all this, is to fix upon you, with your own consent, a strong government that will enable a few proud, intriguing, aristocratical men, to make you the instruments of their avarice and ambition, and trample upon your privileges at pleasure. Your privileges, did I say, I beg your pardon; after a surrender of every thing on your part, into the hands of a few, their pleasure will be your only privileges. I beg you will pardon me, Mr. Wilson, for this digression: it is not a pleasant one, and I wish the cause of it had never existed. We will return, if you please, to your speech. “When we reflect, you say, how various are the laws, commerce, habits, population, and extent, of the confederated states, this evidence of mutual concession and accommodation ought rather to command a generous applause, than to excite a jealousy and reproach. For my part, my admiration can only be equalled by my astonishment in beholding so perfect a system formed from such heterogeneous materials.” What a rhapsody is here; it certainly must have excited equal admiration and astonishment in your audience, and called forth those loud and unanimous testimonies of applause which Doctor Panegyric tells us, accompanied your speech.5 Nil admirari,6 Mr. Wilson, is a wise lesson, and when you recover from your admiration and astonishment which are always incompatible with truth and reason; I shall ask you what union in the world is so similar in their laws, commerce, habits, population and extent? Is there such difference between Rhode-Island and Virginia, as between Holland and Overyssel; between Massachusetts and Georgia, as between Berne and Switzs? Do not the several states harmonize in trial by jury of the vicinage; taxation by representation; habeas corpus; religious toleration; freedom of the press; separation of the legislative, executive and judicial functions. Are not these the great principles on which every [323]constitution is founded? In these the laws and habits of the several states are uniform. But I suppose, because the citizens of New-York are not in the habit of being so ostentatious as those of Philadelphia, nor its merchants, of being such speculators in commerce as to fill the papers with bankruptcies; because in Carolina they are in the habit of eating rice, and in Maryland of eating homony; therefore the materials are heterogeneous, out of which this perfect, system; his subject of amazement, was formed. What was this wonder working concession and accommodation? If they consisted in giving up, or hazarding any of the above fundamental principles of liberty, which I confess seems probable, because some furious spirits in the convention, and such there were, insisted upon it, such conduct may command your generous applause; but trust me, sir, when the people come to feel that their rights have been so basely betrayed by those they trusted, it will command a general execration: And here I cannot avoid remarking on what I have heard and for the truth of which I appeal to you. It is that a member of the late convention said, not very honorably distinguished for his moral or political virtue, admonished his associates that, unless they carried the constitution through before there was time for considering it, there would be no probability of its being adopted.7 When I couple this profligate declaration, with the equally profligate measures taken by some persons to force it down in Philadelphia, and with the indecent speed with which others posted to Congress, and then to their several states, to hurry it forward8—I confess I cannot help apprehending that such advice has not only [been] given, but followed. You would next induce us, Mr. Wilson, to believe, that the state sovereignties will not be annihilated, if the general one be established as the convention recommends. Your reason for this is as curious as it is conclusive. Because the state legislatures must nominate the electors of the President once in four years, and chuse a third of the Senate once in two years; therefore they will continue to be sovereign. Sovereignty then consists in electing the members of a sovereignty; to make laws—preside over the administration of justice—command the militia, or force of the state—these I suppose, do not constitute its sovereignty, for these are totally taken away, and yet you are clear the sovereignty remains. Did you think, Sir, that you was speaking to men or to children, when you hazarded such futile observations. Nor are they compensated by the very profound erudition you display in defining the meaning of the word corporation. In common parlance we should call this egregious pedantry. Such is the anxiety manifested by the framers of the proposed constitution, for the utter extinction of the state sovereignties, that they were not content with taking from them every [324]attribute of sovereignty, but would not leave them even the name.—Therefore, in the very commencement they prescribe this remarkable declaration—We the People of the United States. When the whole people of America shall be thus recognized by their own solemn act, as the people of the United States, I beseech you Sir, to tell us over whom the sovereignty, you say you leave to the several states, is to operate. Did the generous confidence of your fellow citizens, deserve this mockery of their understandings; or inebriated with so unusual a thing as popularity, did you think that every rhapsody you uttered, would be received as reason? That you may not expose yourself again on this subject, give me leave to recommend to you to read Mr. Locke, in whom you will find that sovereignty consists in three things—the legislative, executive, and negociating powers, all which your constitution takes absolutely away from the several states. In Barbeyrac’s Puffendorf, you will find these words, “La souvèraintee entant quelle prescrit des regles generales pour la conduite de la vie civile, s’appelle pouvoir legislatif—entant qu’elle prononce sur les demeles des citoiens, conformement a ces regles, pouvoir judiciaire—entant q’uelle arme les citoiens contre un ennemie etranger, ou qu’elle leur ordonne de mettre fin aux acts d’hostilitès; pouvoir de faire la guerre et la paix; entant qu’elle se choisit des Ministres pour lui aider a prendre soin des affaires publiques; pouvoir d’etablir des magistrats. The sovereignty, inasmuch as it prescribes general rules for the conduct of civil life, is called the legislative power—in deciding controversies among its citizens, conformably to those laws it is called the judiciary power—in arming its citizens against a foreign enemy, or ordering them to cease hostilities; it has the power of war and peace—the appointment of officers to aid it in the case of the public, is the power of establishing magistrates.”9 Now, Sir, all these attributes of sovereignty, being vested exclusively in your new government, is it not a mockery of common sense to tell us, the state sovereignties are not annihilated? and yet you undertake to prove, that upon their existence depends the existence of the federal plan—and when this mighty undertaking is explained, it is because they must meet once in two years to elect part of the federal sovereignty. O fie! O fie!10 Mr. Wilson! you had yet some character to lose, why would you hazard it in this manner? On the subject of taxation, in which powers are to be given so largely by the new constitution, you lull our fears of abuse by venturing to predict “that the great revenue of the United States must and always will be raised by impost”—and you elevate our hopes by holding out, “the reviving and supporting the national credit.” If you have any other plan for this, than by raising money upon the people to pay the interest [325]of the national debt, your ingenuity will deserve our thanks. Supposing however, that raising money is necessary to payment of the interest, and such payment requisite to support the credit of the union; let us see how much will be necessary for that end, and how far the impost will supply what we want. Dollars. The arrearages of French and Spanish interest amount now to 1,500,000 Interest and instalments of do. for 1788, 850,227 Support of government, and its departments, for 1788, 500,000 Arrears and anticipations of 1787, 300,000 Interest of domestic debt. 500,000 4,650,227 The new Congress then, supposing it to get into operation towards October, 1788, will have to provide for this sum, and for the additional sum of 3,000,000 at least for the ensuing year; which together will make the sum of 7,650,227.11 Now let us see how the impost will answer this: Congress have furnished us with their estimate of the produce of the whole imports of America at five per cent. And that is 800,000 dollars:12 there will remain to provide for, by other taxes, 6,850,227. We know too, that our imports diminish yearly, and from the nature of things must continue to diminish; and consequently that the above estimate of the produce of the impost, will in all probability, fall much short of the supposed sum. But even without this, it must appear, that you was either intentionally misleading your hearers, or very little acquainted with the subject when you ventured to predict, that the great revenue of the United States would always flow from the impost. The estimate above is from the publications of Congress, and I presume is right. But the sum stated, is necessary to be raised by the new government, in order to answer the expectations they have raised, is not all. The state debts, independent of what each owes to the United States, amount to about 30,000,000 dollars;13 the annual interest of this is 1,800,000. It will be expected, that the new government will provide for this also; and such expectation is founded, not only on the promise you hold forth, of its reviving and supporting public credit among us, but also on this unavoidable principle of justice, that is the new government takes away the impost, and other substantial taxes, from the produce of which the several states paid the interest of their debt, or funded the paper with which they paid it. The new government must find ways [326]and means of supplying that deficiency, or in other words of paying the interest in hard money, for in paper as now, it cannot, without a violation of the principles it boasts, attempt to pay. The sum then which it must annually raise in specie, after the first year, cannot be less than 4,800,000:14 at present, there is not one half of this sum in specie raised in all the states; and yet the complaints of intolerable taxes has produced one rebellion, and will be mainly operative in the adoption of your constitution.—How you will get this sum is inconceivable, and yet get it you must, or lose all credit. With magnificent promises you have bought golden opinions of all sorts of people, and with gold you must answer them."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,11/30/1787,"To the PEOPLE. It has been proved, from the clearest evidence, in two former papers, that a free government, I mean one in which the power frequently returns to the body of the people, is in principle the most stable and efficient of any kind; that such a government affords the most ready and effectual remedy for all injuries done to persons and the rights of property. It is true we have had a tender act. But what government has not some law in favour of debtors. The difficulty consists in finding one that is not more unfriendly to the creditors than ours. I am far from justifying such things. On the contrary I believe that it is universally true, that acts made to favour a part of the community are wrong in principle. All that is now intended is, to remark that we are not worse than other people in that respect which we most condemn. Probably the inquiry will be made, whence the complaints arise. This is easily answered. Let any man look round his own neighbourhood, and see if the people are not, with a very few exceptions, peaceable and attached to the government; if the country had ever within their knowledge more appearance of industry, improvement, and tranquillity; if there was ever more of the produce of all kinds together for the market; if their stock does not rapidly increase; if there was ever a more ready vent for their surplus; & if the average of prices is not about as high as was usual in a plentiful year before the war. These circumstances all denote a general prosperity. Some classes of citizens indeed suffer greatly. Two descriptions I at present recollect. The publick creditors form the first of these classes and they ought to, and will be, provided for. Let us for a moment consider their situation and prospects. The embar[r]assments consequent upon a war, and the usual reduction of prices immediately after a war, necessarily occasioned a want of punctuality in publick payments. Still however the publick debt has been very considerably reduced, not by the dirty and delusive scheme of depreciation, but the nominal sum. Applications are continually making for purchases in our eastern and western lands. Great exertions are making for clearing off the arrears of outstanding taxes, so that the certificates for interest on the state debt have considerably increased in value. This is a certain indication of returning credit. Congress this year disposed of a large tract of their lands towards paying the principal of their debt. Pennsylvania has discharged the whole of their part of the continental debt. New-York has nearly cleared its state debt, and [343]has located a large part of their new lands towards paying the continental demands. Other states have made considerable payments. Every day from these considerations the publick ability and inclination to satisfy their creditors increases. The exertions of last winter were as much to support publick as private credit. The prospect therefore of the publick creditors is brightening under the present system. If the new system should take effect without amendments, which however is hardly probable, the increase of expense will be death to the hopes of all creditors both of the continental and of the state. With respect however to our publick delays of payment we have the precedent of the best established countries in Europe. The other class of citizens to which I alluded was the ship-carpenters. All agree that their business is dull; but as nobody objects against a system of commercial regulations for the whole continent, that business may be relieved without subverting all the ancient foundations and laws which have the respect of the people. It is a very serious question whether giving to Congress the unlimited right to regulate trade would not injure them still further. It is evidently for the interest of the state to encourage our own trade as much as possible. But in a very large empire, as the whole states consolidated must be, there will always be a desire of the government to increase the trade of the capital, and to weaken the extremes. We should in that case be one of the extremes, and should feel all the impoverishment incident to that situation. Besides, a jealousy of our enterprising spirit, would always be an inducement to cramp our exertions. We must then be impoverished or we must rebel. The alternative is dreadful. At present this state is one of the most respectable and one of the most influential in the union. If we alone should object to receiving the system without amendments, there is no doubt but it would be amended. But the case is not quite so bad. New-York appears to have no disposition even to call a convention. If they should neglect, are we to lend our assistance to compel them by arms, and thus to kindle a civil war without any provocation on their part. Virginia has put off their convention till May, and appears to have no disposition to receive the new plan without amendments. Pennsylvania does not seem to be disposed to receive it as it is. The same objections are made in all the states, that the civil government which they have adopted and which secures their rights will be subverted. All the defenders of this system undertake to prove that the rights of the states and of the citizens are kept safe. The opposers of it agree that they will receive the least burdensome system which shall defend those rights. Both parties therefore found their arguments on the idea that these rights ought to be held [344]sacred. With this disposition is it not in every man’s mind better to recommit it to a new convention, or to Congress, which is a regular convention for the purpose, and to instruct our delegates to confine the system to the general purposes of the union, than to endeavour to force it through in its present form, and with so many opposers as it must have in every state on the continent. The case is not of such pressing necessity as some have represented. Europe is engaged and we are tranquil. Never therefore was an happier time for deliberation. The supporters of the measure are by no means afraid of insurrections taking place, but they are afraid that the present government will prove superiour to their assaults."
Newspaper,No,John De Witt,,American Herald,,12/3/1787,"To the Free Citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The chief blessings of society, like individuals, are fond of association, and have a mutual dependence upon each other. They form links of one chain, and are all actuated by the same cause. Where freedom prevails, industry and science there also prevail. Industry produces wealth, and science preserves freedom in purity. The majority of the people in all such countries become so active in their different pursuits, that they are deprived both of their time and opportunity to inform themselves of the principles of the government by which those great blessings are secured to them, and almost implicitly rely both for the explaining and for the enforcing of those principles upon the patriotism of those, their fellow-citizens, who labour but in the field of enquiry, and who spend their whole time in researches after knowledge. Thanks be to Heaven, that in America, that majority always retaining the power, the others have never dared to enforce their principles, without previous explanation, and it has become natural to mankind, wherever they have a system of any kind, a favorite, if it is as genuine and honest in principle, as in appearance, they leave no active powers of the mind unessayed, in elucidating, explaining and enlarging upon its benefits to those whom they wish should adopt it—all its good qualities are delineated, and every exertion is made to refute all objections offered against it, which exertions will be crowned with success, if the [352]objections in themselves are futile, and will not bear the force of light and argument. The malevolent passions of the heart are not called in, private faults of individuals are not raked from oblivion and magnified, invidious representations are not made, neither are the slanderous, envenomed darts of malice and envy hurled against those characters, who yesterday were deemed praise-worthy and held sacred for a series of obligations conferred by them upon their country, but to-day are execrated with passion, because they do not in all points see as other men see. On the contrary, cool reasoning and dispassionate argument, are of themselves sufficient to build up such a system, to unravel all its mysteries, and to present to the people in expressive, legible colours, the blessings that will result from its adoption. Where this mode of conduct is not pursued by its advocates, where instead of cool reasoning upon the subject in question, artful evasions are presented, the system itself is winked out of sight, instead of dispassionate endeavours to remove difficulties arising in honest minds, which are offered with decency to the public in order to be refuted, those who make them are loaded with the opprobious terms of Insurgents, destroyers of all government, bankrupts, defaulters, and anti-federalists, which is worse than jacobitism: Where, instead of promoting free discussions upon the most important subject ever before a community, attempts are made to fetter and suppress such discussions, by THREATNING the Printer and DROPPING the papers that contain them: Where, instead of coming forward like men, in the full exercise of reason, like fellow-citizens warmed with a patriotick ardour for their country, emulous to secure and preserve its sacred principles, and with proper weapons disarming their fellow-citizens of those objections, they blast and asperse their characters (the dernier resort of all supporters of a bad cause) I say the people have a fair, undoubted right to presume those objections unanswerable, the system itself essentially defective, and that its advocates are, by their conduct, endeavouring not to reason, but to surprize the people into a hasty approbation of it.— That this is the case with the supporters of the proceedings of the Federal Convention, far be it from me to declare.—Judge, my fellow-citizens, for yourselves—examine the public prints from the promulgation of this Constitution. Objections there you will find in score—are they offered with decency? Do they attack men or measures? Are they answered in the same manner? And do you discover a desire in those who wish you to embrace this Government, to inform you of its principles, and the consequences which will probably ensue from such principles—why they have taken from you the sinews of your present [353]government, and instead of revising and amending your Confederation; have handed you a new one, contrasted in the plenitude of its powers.—As you answer these questions, so you must make up your opinion upon that which is before you. They have the power of “organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, and of governing them when in service of the United States, giving to the seperate States the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.” Let us enquire, why they have assumed this power, for if it is for the purpose of forming you into one uniform, solid body throughout the United States, making you respectable both at home and abroad—of arming you more compleatly and exercising you oftener—of strengthening the power which is now lodged in your hands, and relying upon you and you solely for aid and support to the civil power in the execution of all the laws of the New Congress, it certainly can be no where better placed under the restrictions therein mentioned, than in that body. But is this probable. Does the complection of the proceedings countenance such a supposition? When they un-precedently claim the power of raising and supporting standing armies; do they tell you for what purposes they are to be raised?—How they are to be employed?—How many they are to consist of, and where to be stationed?—Is this power fettered with any one of these necessary restrictions which will shew they depend upon the militia, and not upon this infernal engine of oppression to execute their civil laws. The nature of the demand in itself contradicts such a supposition, and forces you to believe that it is for none of these causes—but rather for the purpose of consolidating and finally destroying your strength, as your respective Governments are to be destroyed. They well know the impolicy of putting or keeping arms in the hands of a nervous people, at a distance from the Seat of Government, upon whom they mean to exercise the powers granted in that Government.—They have no idea of calling upon the party aggrieved to support and enforce their own grievances. They are aware of the necessity of catching Samson asleep to trim him of his locks. It is asserted by the most respectable writers upon Government, that a well regulated militia, composed of the yeomanry of the country have ever been considered as the bulwark of a free people; and, says the celebrated Mr. Hume, “without it, it is folly to think any free government will have stability or security—When the sword is introduced, as in our constitution (speaking of the British) the person entrusted will always neglect to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretext for keeping up a standing army; and it is evident this is a mortal distemper in the British [354]parliament, of which it must finally inevitably perish.”2—If they have not the same design, why do they wish a standing army unrestrained? It is universally agreed, that a militia and a standing body of troops never yet flourished in the same soil. Tyrants have uniformly depended upon the latter, at the expence of the former. Experience has taught them, that a standing body of regular forces, where ever they can be compleatly introduced, are always efficacious in enforcing their edicts, however arbitrary, and slaves by profession themselves, are “nothing loath” to break down the barriers of freedom with a goùt.—No, my fellow-citizens, this plainly shews they do not mean to depend upon the citizens of the States alone to enforce their powers, wherefore it is their policy to neglect them, and lean upon something more substantial and summary. It is true, they have left the appointment of officers in the breast of the several States; but this to me, appears an insult, rather than a priveledge, for what avails this right, if they in their pleasure should choose to neglect to arm, organize and discipline the men over whom such Officers are to be appointed. It is a bait, that you might be led to suppose they did intend to apply to them in all cases, and to pay particular attention to making them the bulwark of this Continent.—And would they not be equal to such an undertaking?—Are they not abundantly able to give security and stability to your government as long as it is free? Are they not the only proper persons to do it? Are they not the most respectable body of yeomanry in that character upon earth? Have they not been deeply engaged in some of the most brilliant actions in America, and more than once decided the fate of armies? In short, do they not preclude the necessity of any standing army whatsoever, unless in case of invasion; and in that case it would be time enough to raise them, for no free government under Heaven, with a well disciplined militia was ever yet subdued by mercenary troops. The advocates at the present day, for a standing army in the New Congress pretend it is necessary for the respectability of government. I defy them to produce an instance in any country, in the Old or New World, where they have not finally done away the liberties of the people:—Every writer upon government,—Lock, Sidney, Hamden, and a list of others have uniformly asserted, that standing armies are a solecism in any government; that no nation ever supported them, that did not resort to, rely upon, and finally become a prey to them.—No Western Historians have yet been hardy enough to advance principles that look a different way. What historians have asserted, all the Grecian Republicks have verified—They are brought up to obedience and unconditional submission.—With arms in their hands, they are taught to feel the weight of rigid discipline:—They are excluded from the enjoyments [355]which liberty gives to its votaries, they, in consequence, hate and envy the rest of the community in which they are placed, and indulge a malignant pleasure in destroying those privileges to which they never can be admitted.—“Without them, says the Marquis of Beccaria, in every society there is an effort constantly tending to confer on one part the height of power, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery, and this is of itself sufficient to employ the people’s attention.”3 There is no instance of any government being reduced to a confirmed tyranny without military oppression; and the first policy of tyrants has been to annihilate all other means of national activity and defence, and to rely solely upon standing troops.—Repeated were the trials before the Sovereigns of Europe dared to introduce them upon any pretext whatever; and the whole record of the transactions of mankind cannot furnish an instance (unless the proceedings of the Convention may now be called a part of that record) where the motives which caused their establishment, were not completely disguised.—Pisistratus in Greece, and Dyonysius in Syracuse, Charles in France, and Henry in England, all cloaked their villainous intentions under an idea of raising a small body for a guard to their persons; and Spain, could not succeed in the same nefarious plan, until through the influence of the ambitious Priest, they were called upon to resist the progress of the Infidels.4 “Cæsar, who first attacked the commonwealth with mines, very soon opened his batteries.”5—Notwithstanding all these objections to this engine of oppression, which are made by the most experienced men, and confirmed by every country, where the rays of freedom ever extended.—Yet in America, which has hitherto been her favorite abode—in this civilized territory, where property is valuable, and men are found with feelings that will not patiently submit to arbitrary controul—in this Western region, where, my fellow-countrymen, it is confessedly proper that you should associate and dwell in society from choice and reflection, and not be kept together by force and fear, you are modestly requested to engraft into the component parts of your Constitution, a STANDING ARMY, without any qualifying restraints whatever,—certainly to exist somewhere within the bowels of your country in time of peace. It is very true, that the celebrated Mr. Wilson, a member of the Convention, and who we may suppose breathes, in some measure, the spirit of that body, tells you, it is for the purpose of forming cantonments upon your frontiers, and for the dignity and safety of your country, as it respects foreign nations.6 No man that loves his country could object to their being raised for the first of these causes, but for the last it cannot be necessary. God has so separated us by an extensive ocean from the rest of mankind, he hath so liberally [356]endowed us with privileges, and so abundantly taught us to esteem them precious, it would be impossible, while we retain our integrity and advert to first principles, for any nation whatever to subdue us. We have succeeded in an opposition to the most powerful people upon the globe; and the wound that America received in the struggle, where is it? As speedily healed as the track in the ocean is buried by the succeeding wave. It has scarcely stopped her progress, and our private dissentions only at this moment, tarnish the lustre of the most illustrious infant nation under Heaven. You cannot help suspecting this gentleman, when he goes on to tell you, “that standing armies in time of peace, have always been a topic of popular declamation, but Europe hath found them necessary to maintain the appearance of strength in a season of the most profound tranquility.”7—This shews you his opinion, and that he as one of the Convention, was for unequivocally establishing them in time of peace; and to object to them is mere popular declamation. But I will not, my countrymen, I cannot believe you to be of the same sentiment. Where is the standing army in the world, that, like the musquet they make use of, hath been, in time of peace, brightned and burnished for the sake only of maintaining an appearance of strength, without being put to a different use, without having had a pernicious influence upon the morals, the habits, and the sentiments of society, and finally, taking a chief part in executing its laws. But some say, that there is a controul over them, and that consists in the appropriation of monies for their support. Turn your attention to England, and see the popular part of this constitution by the influence of money, by the influence of military and revenue officers, brought gravely to give their annual assent to the existence of a standing army, and for monies to support it. It has long since been an insult on the good sense of that nation. It may not be amiss to remind you of that swarm of revenue, excise, impost and stamp officers, Continental assessors and collectors, that your new Constitution will introduce among you. They will, of themselves, be a STANDING ARMY to you, and you will see them at your elections, active and industr[i]ous to secure the seats of those men who put them into office:—They will be very adequate to give you a surfeit of their company, to make you tired in meddling with government, and disposed to become indifferent about the exercise of it, without the blessed assistance of any military corps.— Upon the whole, my countrymen, it appears to me, that this power as it now stands, is decidedly improper and dangerous. That Congress ought to have the power of raising armies when invaded by our enemies, [357]is certain; that they ought not to have it for any other cause, is equally so. If they did not or do not mean to employ them in any other way, they ought in express terms to say so, in a Bill of Rights. They never ought to exist at all, but in subordination to civil authority. If the people are not in general disposed to execute the powers of government, it is time to suspect there is something wrong in that government, and rather than employ a standing army, they had better have another; for, in my humble opinion, it is yet much too early to set it down for a fact, that mankind cannot be governed, but by force."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/4/1787,"To the PEOPLE. Having considered some of the principal advantages of the happy form of government under which it is our peculiar good fortune to live, we find by experience, that it is the best calculated of any form hitherto invented, to secure to us the rights of our persons and of our property, and that the general circumstances of the people shew an advanced state of improvement never before known. We have found the shock given by the war in a great measure obliterated, and the publick debt contracted at that time to be considerably reduced in the nominal sum. The Congress lands are fully adequate to the redemption of the principal of their debt, and are selling and populating very fast.1 The lands of this state, at the west, are, at the moderate price of eighteen pence an acre, worth near half a million pounds in our money. They ought, therefore, to be sold as quick as possible. An application was made lately for a large tract at that price,2 and continual applications [382]are made for other lands in the eastern part of the state.3 Our resources are daily augmenting. We find, then, that after the experience of near two centuries our separate governments are in full vigour. They discover, for all the purposes of internal regulation, every symptom of strength, and none of decay. The new system is, therefore, for such purposes, useless and burdensome. Let us now consider how far it is practicable consistent with the happiness of the people and their freedom. It is the opinion of the ablest writers on the subject, that no extensive empire can be governed upon republican principles, and that such a government will degenerate to a despotism, unless it be made up of a confederacy of smaller states, each having the full powers of internal regulation. This is precisely the principle which has hitherto preserved our freedom. No instance can be found of any free government of considerable extent which has been supported upon any other plan. Large and consolidated empires may indeed dazzle the eyes of a distant spectator with their splendour, but if examined more nearly are always found to be full of misery. The reason is obvious. In large states the same principles of legislation will not apply to all the parts. The inhabitants of warmer climates are more dissolute in their manners, and less industrious, than in colder countries. A degree of severity is, therefore, necessary with one which would cramp the spirit of the other. We accordingly find that the very great empires have always been despotick. They have indeed tried to remedy the inconveniences to which the people were exposed by local regulations; but these contrivances have never answered the end. The laws not being made by the people, who felt the inconveniences, did not suit their circumstances. It is under such tyranny that the Spanish provinces languish, and such would be our misfortune and degradation, if we should submit to have the concerns of the whole empire managed by one legislature. To promote the happiness of the people it is necessary that there should be local laws; and it is necessary that those laws should be made by the representatives of those who are immediately subject to the want of them. By endeavouring to suit both extremes, both are injured. It is impossible for one code of laws to suit Georgia and Massachusetts. They must, therefore, legislate for themselves. Yet there is, I believe, not one point of legislation that is not surrendered in the proposed plan. Questions of every kind respecting property are determinable in a continental court, and so are all kinds of criminal causes. The continental legislature has, therefore, a right to make rules in all cases by which their judicial courts shall proceed and decide [383]causes. No rights are reserved to the citizens. The laws of Congress are in all cases to be the supreme law of the land, and paramount to the constitutions of the individual states. The Congress may institute what modes of trial they please, and no plea drawn from the constitution of any state can avail. This new system is, therefore, a consolidation of all the states into one large mass, however diverse the parts may be of which it is to be composed. The idea of an uncompounded republick, on an average, one thousand miles in length, and eight hundred in breadth, and containing six millions of white inhabitants4 all reduced to the same standard of morals, of habits, and of laws, is in itself an absurdity, and contrary to the whole experience of mankind. The attempt made by Great-Britain to introduce such a system, struck us with horrour, and when it was proposed by some theorists that we should be represented in parliament, we uniformly declared that one legislature could not represent so many different interests for the purposes of legislation and taxation. This was the leading principle of the revolution, and makes an essential article in our creed. All that part, therefore, of the new system, which relates to the internal government of the states, ought at once to be rejected."
Newspaper,No,Cincinnatus,,New York Journal,,12/6/1787,"Sir, When I stated the monied difficulties, which the new government will have to encounter, my chief object was to prove to our fellow citizens, the delusion into which you have led them in your speech, when [368]you ventured “to predict that the great revenue of the United States, must, and always will be, raised by impost.” This is not the land, Sir, of second sight; and I have shewn that your prediction, is not founded on any knowledge of the subject. It is one of those numerous deceptions, that are practised upon the people to delude them into the toils that are spread for them by the proposed constitution. To satisfy them more fully on the subject of the revenue, that is to be raised upon them, in order to give enormous fortunes to the jobbers in public securities, I shall lay before them a proposition to Congress, from Mr. Robert Morris, when superintendant of finance. It is dated, I think,(a) the 29th of June, 1782, and is in these words:—“The requisition of a five per cent, impost, made on the 3d of February, 1781,2 has not yet been complied with by the state of Rhode-Island, but as there is reason to believe, that their compliance is not far off, this revenue may be considered as already granted.—It will, however, be very inadequate to the purposes intended. If goods be imported, and prizes introduced to the amount of twelve millions annually, the five per cent, would be six hundred thousand, from which at least one sixth must be deducted, as well for the cost of collection as for the various defalcations which will necessarily happen, and which it is unnecessary to enumerate. It is not safe therefore, to estimate this revenue at more than, half a million of dollars; for though it may produce more, yet probably it will not produce so much. It was in consequence of this, that on the 27th day of February last, I took the liberty to submit the propriety of asking the states for a land tax of one dollar for every hundred acres of land—a poll-tax of one dollar on all freemen, and all male slaves, between sixteen and sixty, excepting such as are in the federal army, or by wounds or otherwise rendered unfit for service; and an excise of one eighth of a dollar [per gallon], on all distilled spiritous liquors. Each of these may be estimated at half a million; and should the product be equal to the estimation, the sum total of revenues for funding the public debts, would be equal to two millions.”3 You will readily perceive, Mr. Wilson, that there is a vast difference between your prediction and your friends proposition. Give me leave to say, Sir, that it was not discreet, in you, to speak upon finance without instructions from this great financier. Since, independent of its delusive effect upon your audience, it may excite his jealousy, lest you should have a secret design of rivalling him in the expected office of superintendant under the new constitution. It is true, there is no real foundation for it; but then you know jealousy makes the food it feeds on. A quarrel between two such able and honest friends to the United States, would, I am persuaded, be felt as a public calamity. I beseech [369]you then to be very tender upon this point in your next harrangue. And if four months study will not furnish you with sufficient descretion, we will indulge you with six. It may be said, that let the government be what it may, the sums I have stated must be raised, and the same difficulties exist. This is not altogether true. For first, we are now in the way of paying the interest of the domestic debt, with paper, which under the new system is utterly reprobated. This makes a difference between the specie to be raised of 1,800,000 dollars per annum. If the new government raises this sum in specie on the people, it will certainly support public credit, but it will overwhelm the people. It will give immense fortunes to the speculators; but it will grind the poor to dust. Besides the present government is now redeeming the principal of the domestic debt by the sale of western lands. But let the full interest be paid in specie, and who will part with the principal for those lands. A principal, which having been generally purchased for two shillings and six pence on the pound, will yield to the holders two hundred and forty per cent. This paper system therefore, though in general an evil, is in this instance attended with the great benefit of enabling the public to cancel a debt upon easy terms, which has been swelled to its enormous size, by as enormous impositions. And the new government, by promising too much, will involve itself in a disreputable breech of faith, or in a difficulty of complying with it, insuperable. The present government promises nothing.—The intended government, every thing.—From the present government little is expected:—From the intended one, much. Because it is conceived that to the latter much is given—to the former, little. And yet the inability of the people to pay what is required in specie, remaining the same, the funds of the one will not much exceed those of the other. The public creditors are easy with the present government from a conviction of its inability—they will be urgent with the new one from an opinion, that as it promises, so it can and will perform every thing. Whether the change will be for our prosperity and honour, is yet to be tried. Perhaps it will be found, that the supposed want of power in Congress to levy taxes, is at present a veil happily thrown over the inability of the people; and that the large powers given to the new government, will to every eye, expose the nakedness of our land. Certain it is, that if the expectations which are grafted on the gift of these plenary powers, are not answered, our credit will be irretrievably ruined. Once more, Mr. Wilson, be pleased to pardon me for digressing. We come now to your last argument, or rather observation, which is in these terms—That as establishing the new government will—“turn the [370]stream of influence and emolument into a new channel, therefore every person who enjoys or expects to enjoy a place of profit under the present establishment, will object to the proposed innovation, not in truth, because it is injurious to the liberties of his country, but because it affects his schemes of wealth and consequence.” This reflection, sir, is as ingenious as it is liberal. It reaches every man who will not worship the new idol. It is the shibboleth of your party. Every man who differs in opinion with you, upon the new constitution, if he is not actually a placeman under the present establishment, may be an expectant; and then, according to your liberal and gentlemanly conclusion, his opinion must be imputed to his pursuit of wealth and consequence. But how could it escape you, that this was a two-edged argument, and might cut its inventor. Perhaps these very violent gentlemen for the new establishment, may be actuated by the same undue motives. Perhaps some of its framers, might have had its honours and emoluments in view. When you have let loose suspicion, Mr. Wilson, there is no knowing where it will end. Perhaps some may be audacious enough to suspect even—you. They may think, that the emoluments of an attorney generalship, or of a chief justice largely provided for, under a government gifted with almost chemic powers to extract gold from the people, might happily repair your shattered fortunes. Let us, Sir, suppose a man fallen from opulence into the most gloomy depths of monied distress, by an unsatiable love of wealth and as unwise a pursuit of it:4 would not such a man be a fit instrument in the hands of others to agitate the introduction of the new constitution. Such a man would have no objection to the golden speculations which such a constitution holds forth. Such a man, albeit unused to speak without a fee, and a large one too, would deign to harrangue gratis for such an object. His crest would be brightened, his eloquence animated by an anticipation of that happy hour, when he might sail down this new pactolean channel, accompanied by his pathetic Doctor,5 to sing a requiem to our expired liberties, and chant hallelujahs to his approach—to wealth and consequence. Such a man, Sir, in such a mood, would, as you do, regard the new constitution, in every point of view, with a candid and disinterested mind, and be bold to assert, “that it is the best form of government which has ever been offered to the world.” Such a man as I have painted, you know, Mr. Wilson, is not a fiction. What I have said was not to insult his distresses, but to admonish his discretion. He ought not to have touched ground, on which he, and his swelled superior,6 who dances him forth to the people, is so very vulnerable. Upon my honor, Sir, I do not know two men in the United [371]States more tender in this point. Permit me then to admonish them, through you, never again to insult the patience of the public with insinuations about the judgment of men on the proposed constitution, being affected by schemes of wealth and consequence. There is one very material power given to the proposed Congress, on which you have thought proper to be silent, and which as not coming within the scope of your speech I have reserved to this place. In the 4th section, it is said—“The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of chusing senators.” In all our constitutions, the regulation of elections is fixed; not left to the legislature, because it is a fundamental right, in which the essence of liberty resides. It is in fact the root of all rights. Nothing can be plainer than that Congress, under the pretence of regulating, might in various ways annihilate the freedom of elections. If ever the aristocracy should meet with a pliant representative, it will be easy so to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections—as to secure the complaisance of future representatives. This power over elections is another proof of a prediction for the senate, and a determination to have a complete controul over the people. It participates precisely of the spirit, which dictated the rendering the power of impeachment nugatory, by the manner in which it is to be executed Thus too, the right of election, under controul from time to time, in point of manner, times, and places, is but a shadow in the people; while the substance will necessarily reside with those to whom the regulation of it is resigned. But the senate was too sacred to be subjected to this unhallowed touch. The aristocracy is elevated on high, while the democracy is trampled in the dust. If the people can indeed be deluded into such a surrender of their most sacred rights; it must arise from the precipitation with which they are called upon to decide. Still, however, I trust, that they will have discernment to discover the parts which are incompatible with their rights and liberties, and spirit to insist upon those parts being amended. (a) I say, I think, because, by accident, the month is erased in the note I have, and I have not access to public papers which would enable me to supply the defect."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Governor Edmund Randolph,Virginia Gazette,,12/6/1787,"Dear Sir, I was duly honored with your favor of September 17th, from Philadelphia, which should have been acknowledged long before now, if the nature of the business that it related to had not required time. The establishment of the new plan of government, in its present form, is a question that involves such immense consequences to the present [367page icon]times and to posterity, that it calls for the deepest attention of the best and wisest friends of their country and of mankind. If it be found good after mature deliberation, adopt it, if wrong, amend it at all events, for to say (as many do) that a bad government must be established for fear of anarchy, is really saying that we must kill ourselves for fear of dying. Experience and the actual state of things, shew that there is no difficulty in procuring a general convention; the late one being collected without any obstruction: Nor does external war, or internal discord prevent the most cool, collected, full, and fair discussion of this all-important subject. If with infinite ease, a convention was obtained to prepare a system, why may not another with equal ease be procured to make proper and necessary amendments? Good government is not the work of a short time, or of sudden thought. From Moses to Montesquieu the greatest geniuses have been employed on this difficult subject, and yet experience has shewn capital defects in the system produced for the government of mankind. But since it is neither prudent or easy to make frequent changes in government, and as bad governments have been generally found the most fixed; so it becomes of the last consequence to frame the first establishment upon ground the most unexceptionable, and such as the best theories with experience justify; not trusting as our new constitution does, and as many approve of doing, to time and future events to correct errors, that both reason and experience in similar cases, point out in the new system. It has hitherto been supposed a fundamental maxim that in governments rightly balanced, the different branches of legislature should be unconnected, and that the legislative and executive powers should be separate:–In the new constitution, the president and senate have all the executive and two thirds of the legislative power. In some weighty instances (as making all kinds of treaties which are to be the laws of the land) they have the whole legislative and executive powers. They jointly, appoint all officers civil and military, and they (the senate) try all impeachments either of their own members, or of the officers appointed by themselves. Is there not a most formidable combination of power thus created in a few, and can the most critic eye, if a candid one, discover responsibility in this potent corps? Or will any sensible man say, that great power without responsibility can be given to rulers with safety to liberty? It is most clear that the parade of impeachment is nothing to them or any of them—as little restraint is to be found, I presume from the fear of offending constituents.–The president is for four years duration (and Virginia for example) has one vote of thirteen in the choice of him, and this thirteenth vote not of the people, but electors, two removes from the people. The senate is a body of six years duration, and as in the choice [368page icon]of president, the largest state has but a thirteenth vote, so is it in the choice of senators.–This latter statement is adduced to shew that responsibility is as little to be apprehended from amenability to constituents, as from the terror of impeachment. You are, therefore, Sir, well warranted in saying, either a monarchy or aristocracy will be generated, perhaps the most grievous system of government may arise. It cannot be denied with truth, that this new constitution is, in its first principles, highly and dangerously oligarchic; and it is a point agreed that a government of the few, is, of all governments, the worst. The only check to be found in favor of the democratic principle in this system is, the house of representatives; which I believe may justly be called a mere shread or rag of representation: It being obvious to the least examination, that small ness of number and great comparative disparity of power, renders that house of little effect to promote good, or restrain bad government. But what is the power given to this ill constructed body? To judge of what may be for the general welfare, and such judgments when made, the acts of Congress become the supreme laws of the land. This seems a power co-extensive with every possible object of human legislation.–Yet there is no restraint in form of a bill of rights, to secure (what Doctor Blackstone calls) that residuum of human rights, which is not intended to be given up to society, and which indeed is not necessary to be given for any good social purpose.2—The rights of conscience, the freedom of the press, and the trial by jury are at mercy. It is there stated, that in criminal cases, the trial shall be by jury. But how? In the state. What then becomes of the jury of the vicinage or at least from the county in the first instance, for the states being from 50 to 700 miles in extent? This mode of trial even in criminal cases may be greatly impaired, and in civil causes the inference is strong, that it may be altogether omitted as the constitution positively assumes it in criminal, and is silent about it in civil causes.–Nay, it is more strongly discountenanced in civil cases by giving the supreme court in appeals, jurisdiction both as to law and fact. Judge Blackstone in his learned commentaries, art. jury trial, says, it is the most transcendant privilege which any subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, his person, but by the unanimous consent of 12 of his neighbours and equals.3 A constitution that I may venture to affirm has under providence, secured the just liberties of this nation for a long succession of ages.–The impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society. But if that be entirely entrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince, or such as enjoy the highest offices of the state, these decisions in spite of their own natural [369page icon]integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity. It is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should always be attentive to the good of the many. The learned judge further says, that every tribunal selected for the decision of facts, is a step towards establishing aristocracy; the most oppressive of all governments. The answer to these objections is, that the new legislature may provide remedies!–But as they may, so they may not, and if they did, a succeeding assembly may repeal the provisions.–The evil is found resting upon constitutional bottom, and the remedy upon the mutable ground of legislation, revocable at any annual meeting. It is the more unfortunate that this great security of human rights, the trial by jury, should be weakened in this system, as power is unnecessarily given in the second section of the third article, to call people from their own country in all cases of controversy about property between citizens of different states and foreigners, with citizens of the United States, to be tried in a distant court where the Congress may sit. For although inferior congressional courts may for the above purposes be instituted in the different states, yet this is a matter altogether in the pleasure of the new legislature, so that if they please not to institute them, or if they do not regulate the right of appeal reasonably, the people will be exposed to endless oppression, and the necessity of submitting in multitudes of cases, to pay unjust demands, rather than follow suitors, through great expence, to far distant tribunals, and to be determined upon there, as it may be, without a jury.–In this congressional legislature, a bare majority of votes can enact commercial laws, so that the representatives of the seven northern states, as they will have a majority, can by law create the most oppressive monopoly upon the five southern states, whose circumstances and productions are essentially different from theirs, although not a single man of these voters are the representatives of, or amenable to the people of the southern states. Can such a set of men be, with the least colour of truth called a representative of those they make laws for? It is supposed that the policy of the northern states will prevent such abuses. But how feeble, Sir, is policy when opposed to interest among trading people:–And what is the restraint arising from policy? Why that we may be forced by abuse to become ship-builders!–But how long will it be before a people of agriculture can produce ships sufficient to export such bulky commodities as ours, and of such extent; and if we had the ships, from whence are the seamen to come? 4000 of whom at least will be necessary in Virginia. In questions so liable to abuse, why was not the necessary vote put to two thirds of the members of the legislature? With the constitution came from the convention, so many members of that body to Congress, and of those too, who were among the most fiery [370page icon]zealots for their system, that the votes of three states being of them, two states divided by them, and many others mixed with them, it is easy to see that Congress could have little opinion upon the subject.4 Some denied our right to make amendments, whilst others more moderate agreed to the right, but denied the expediency of amending; but it was plain that a majority was ready to send it on in terms of approbation—my judgment and conscience forbid the last, and therefore I moved the amendments that I have the honor to send you inclosed herewith, and demanded the yeas and nays that they might appear on the journal. This seemed to alarm and to prevent such appearance on the journal, it was agreed to transmit the constitution without a syllable of approbation or disapprobation; so that the term unanimously only applied to the transmission, as you will observe by attending to the terms of the resolve for transmitting. Upon the whole, Sir, my opinion is, that as this constitution abounds with useful regulations, at the same time that it is liable to strong and fundamental objections, the plan for us to pursue, will be to propose the necessary amendments, and express our willingness to adopt it with the amendments, and to suggest the calling of a new convention for the purpose of considering them. To this I see no well founded objection, but great safety and much good to be the probable result. I am perfectly satisfied that you make such use of this letter as you shall think to be for the public good; and now after begging your pardon for so great a trespass on your patience, and presenting my best respects to your lady, I will conclude with assuring you, that I am with the sincerest esteem and regard, dear Sir, your most affectionate and obedient servant, richard henry lee. postscript.5 It having been found from universal experience, that the most express declarations and reservations are necessary to protect the just rights and liberty of mankind from the silent, powerful and ever active conspiracy of those who govern; and it appearing to be the sense of the good people of America, by the various bills or declarations of rights whereon the government of the greater number of states are founded. That such precautions are necessary to restrain and regulate the exercise of the great powers given to rulers. In conformity with these principles, and from respect for the public sentiment on this subject, it is submitted,–That the new constitution proposed for the government of the United States be bottomed upon a declaration or bill of rights, clearly and precisely stating the principles upon which this social compact is founded, to wit: That the rights of conscience in matters of religion ought not to be violated–That the freedom of the press shall be secured–That the trial by [371page icon]jury in criminal and civil cases, and the modes prescribed by the common law for the safety of life in criminal prosecutions, shall be held sacred–That standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be permitted, unless assented to by two-thirds of the members composing each house of the legislature under the new constitution–That the elections should be free and frequent; That the right administration of justice should be secured by the independency of the judges; That excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel and unusual punishments, should not be demanded or inflicted: That the right of the people to assemble peaceably, for the purpose of petitioning the legislature, shall not be prevented; That the citizens shall not be exposed to unreasonable searches, seizure of their persons, houses, papers or property; and it is necessary for the good of society, that the administration of government be conducted with all possible maturity of judgment, for which reason it hath been the practice of civilized nations, and so determined by every state in the Union: That a council of state or privy council should be appointed to advise and assist in the arduous business assigned to the executive power. Therefore let the new constitution be so amended, as to admit the appointment of a privy council, to consist of eleven members chosen by the president, but responsible for the advice they may give. For which purpose the advice given shall be entered in a council book, and signed by the giver, in all affairs of great moment, and that the counsellors act under an oath of office. In order to prevent the dangerous blending of the legislative and executive powers, and to secure responsibility, the privy, and not the senate shall be joined with the president in the appointment of all officers, civil and military, under the new constitution; that the constitution be so altered as not to admit the creation of a vice-president, when duties as assigned may be discharged by the privy council, except in the instance of proceeding in the senate, which may be supplied by a speaker chosen from the body of senators by themselves, as usual, that so may be avoided the establishment of a great officer of state, who is sometimes to be joined with the legislature, and sometimes to administer the government, rendering responsibility difficult, besides giving unjust and needless preeminence to that state from whence this officer may have come. That such parts of the new constitution be amended as provide imperfectly for the trial of criminals by a jury of the vicinage, and to supply the omission of a jury trial in civil causes or disputes about property between individuals, whereby the common law is directed, and as generally it is secured by the several state constitutions. That such parts of the new constitution be amended, as permit the vexatious and oppressive callings [372page icon]of citizens from their own country, and all controversies between citizens of different states and between citizens and foreigners, to be tried in a far distant court, and as it may be without a jury, whereby in a multitude of cases, the circumstances of distance and expence may compel numbers to submit to the most unjust and ill-founded demand–That in order to secure the rights of the people more effectually from violation, the power and respectability of the house of representatives be increased, by increasing the number of delegates to that house, where the popular interest must chiefly depend for protection–That the constitution be so amended as to increase the number of votes necessary to determine questions in cases where a bare majority may be seduced by strong motives of interest to injure and oppress the minority of the community, as in commercial regulations, where advantage may be taken of circumstances to ordain rigid and premature laws, that will in effect amount to monopolies, to the great impoverishment of those states whose peculiar situation expose them to such injuries."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/11/1787,"To the PEOPLE. In the course of inquiry it has appeared, that for the purposes of internal regulation and domestick tranquillity, our small and separate [407]governments are not only admirably suited in theory, but have been remarkably successful in practice. It is also found, that the direct tendency of the proposed system, is to consolidate the whole empire into one mass, and, like the tyrant’s bed, to reduce all to one standard.2 Though this idea has been started in different parts of the continent, and is the most important trait of this draft, the reasoning ought to be extensively understood. I therefore hope to be indulged in a particular statement of it. Causes of all kinds, between citizens of different states, are to be tried before a continental court. This court is not bound to try it according to the local laws where the controversies happen; for in that case it may as well be tried in a state court. The rule which is to govern the new courts, must, therefore, be made by the court itself, or by its employers, the Congress. If by the former, the legislative and judicial departments will be blended; and if by the Congress, though these departments will be kept separate, still the power of legislation departs from the state in all those cases. The Congress, therefore, have the right to make rules for trying all kinds of questions relating to property between citizens of different states. The sixth article of the new constitution provides, that the continental laws shall be the supreme law of the land, and all judges in the separate states shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. All the state officers are also bound by oath to support this constitution. These provisions cannot be understood otherwise than as binding the state judges and other officers, to execute the continental laws in their own proper departments within the state. For all questions, other than those between citizens of the same state, are at once put within the jurisdiction of the continental courts. As no authority remains to the state judges, but to decide questions between citizens of the same state, and those judges are to be bound by the laws of Congress, it clearly follows, that all questions between citizens of the same state are to be decided by the general laws and not by the local ones. Authority is also given to the continental courts, to try all causes between a state and its own citizens. A question of property between these parties rarely occurs. But if such questions were more frequent than they are, the proper process is not to sue the state before an higher authority; but to apply to the supreme authority of the state, by way of petition. This is the universal practice of all states, and any other mode of redress destroys the sovereignty of the state over its own subjects. The only case of the kind in which the state would probably be sued, would be upon the state notes. The endless confusion that would [408]arise from making the estates of individuals answerable, must be obvious to every one. There is another sense in which the clause relating to causes between the state and individuals is to be understood, and it is more probable than the other, as it will be eternal in its duration, and increasing in its extent. This is the whole branch of the law relating to criminal prosecutions. In all such cases, the state is plaintiff, and the person accused is defendant. The process, therefore, will be, for the attorney-general of the state to commence his suit before a continental court. Considering the state as a party, the cause must be tried in another, and all the expense of transporting witnesses incurred. The individual is to take his trial among strangers, friendless and unsupported, without its being known whether he is habitually a good or a bad man; and consequently with one essential circumstance wanting by which to determine whether the action was performed maliciously or accidentally. All these inconveniences are avoided by the present important restriction, that the cause shall be tried by a jury of the vicinity, and tried in the county where the offence was committed. But by the proposed derangement, I can call it by no softer name, a man must be ruined to prove his innocence. This is far from being a forced construction of the proposed form. The words appear to me not intelligible, upon the idea that it is to be a system of government, unless the construction now given, both for civil and criminal processes, be admitted. I do not say that it is intended that all these changes should take place within one year, but they probably will in the course of half a dozen years, if this system is adopted. In the mean time we shall be subject to all the horrors of a divided sovereignty, not knowing whether to obey the Congress or the state. We shall find it impossible to please two masters. In such a state frequent broils will ensue. Advantage will be taken of a popular commotion, and even the venerable forms of the state be done away, while the new system will be enforced in its utmost rigour, by an army. I am the more apprehensive of a standing army, on account of a clause in the new constitution which empowers Congress to keep one at all times; but this constitution is evidently such that it cannot stand any considerable time without an army. Upon this principle one is very wisely provided. Our present government knows of no such thing."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/14/1787,"To the PEOPLE. To prevent any mistakes, or misapprehensions of the argument, stated in my last paper,2 to prove that the proposed constitution is an [427]actual consolidation of the separate states into one extensive commonwealth, the reader is desired to observe, that in the course of the argument, the new plan is considered as an intire system. It is not dependent on any other book for an explanation, and contains no references to any other book. All the defences of it, therefore, so far as they are drawn from the state constitutions, or from maxims of the common law, are foreign to the purpose. It is only by comparing the different parts of it together, that the meaning of the whole is to be understood. For instance— We find in it, that there is to be a legislative assembly, with authority to constitute courts for the trial of all kinds of civil causes, between citizens of different states. The right to appoint such courts necessarily involves in it the right of defining their powers, and determining the rules by which their judgment shall be regulated; and the grant of the former of those rights is nugatory without the latter. It is vain to tell us, that a maxim of common law requires contracts to be determined by the law existing where the contract was made: for it is also a maxim, that the legislature has a right to alter the common law. Such a power forms an essential part of legislation. Here, then, a declaration of rights is of inestimable value. It contains those principles which the government never can invade without an open violation of the compact between them and the citizens. Such a declaration ought to have come to the new constitution in favour of the legislative rights of the several states, by which their sovereignty over their own citizens within the state should be secured. Without such an express declaration the states are annihilated in reality upon receiving this constitution—the forms will be preserved only during the pleasure of Congress. The idea of consolidation is further kept up in the right given to regulate trade. Though this power under certain limitations would be a proper one for the department of Congress; it is in this system carried much too far, and much farther than is necessary. This is, without exception, the most commercial state upon the continent. Our extensive coasts, cold climate, small estates, and equality of rights, with a variety of subordinate and concurring circumstances, place us in this respect at the head of the union. We must, therefore, be indulged if a point which so nearly relates to our welfare be rigidly examined. The new constitution not only prohibits vessels, bound from one state to another, from paying any duties, but even from entering and clearing. The only use of such a regulation is, to keep each state in complete ignorance of its own resources. It certainly is no hardship to enter and clear at the custom-house, and the expense is too small to be an object. The unlimitted right to regulate trade, includes the right of granting exclusive charters. This, in all old countries, is considered as one principle branch of prerogative. We find hardly a country in Europe which has not felt the ill effects of such a power. Holland has carried the exercise of it farther than any other state; and the reason why that country has felt less evil from it is, that the territory is very small, and they have drawn large revenues from their colonies in the East and West Indies. In this respect, the whole country is to be considered as a trading company, having exclusive privileges. The colonies are large in proportion to the parent state; so that, upon the whole, the latter may gain by such a system. We are also to take into consideration the industry which the genius of a free government inspires. But in the British islands all these circumstances together have not prevented them from being injured by the monopolies created there. Individuals have been enriched, but the country at large has been hurt. Some valuable branches of trade being granted to companies, who transact their business in London, that city is, perhaps, the place of the greatest trade in the world. But Ireland, under such influence, suffers exceedingly, and is impoverished; and Scotland is a mere bye-word. Bristol, the second city in England, ranks not much above this town in population. These things must be accounted for by the incorporation of trading companies; and if they are felt so severely in countries of small extent, they will operate with ten-fold severity upon us, who inhabit an immense tract; and living towards one extreme of an extensive empire, shall feel the evil, without retaining that influence in government, which may enable us to procure redress. There ought, then, to have been inserted a restraining clause, which might prevent the Congress from making any such grant, because they consequentially defeat the trade of the out-ports, and are also injurious to the general commerce, by enhancing prices, and destroying that rivalship which is the great stimulous to industry."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/18/1787,"To the PEOPLE. There cannot be a doubt, that, while the trade of this continent remains free, the activity of our countrymen will secure their full share. All the estimates for the present year, let them be made by what party they may, suppose the balance of trade to be largely in our favour. The credit of our merchants is, therefore, fully established in foreign countries. This is a sufficient proof, that when business is unshackled, it will find out that channel which is most friendly to its course. We ought, therefore, to be exceedingly cautious about diverting or restraining it. Every day produces fresh proofs, that people, under the immediate pressure of difficulties, do not, at first glance, discover the proper relief. The last year, a desire to get rid of embarrassments induced many honest people to agree to a tender-act, and many others, of a different description, to obstruct the courts of justice. Both these methods only increased the evil they were intended to cure. Experience has since shewn, that, instead of trying to lessen an evil by altering the present course of things, that every endeavour should have been applied to facilitate the course of law, and thus to encourage a mutual confidence among the citizens, which increases the resources of them all, and renders easy the payment of debts. By this means one does not grow rich at the expense of another, but all are benefited. The case is the same with the states. Pennsylvania, with one port and a large territory, is less favourably situated for trade than the Massachusetts, which has an extensive coast in proportion to its limits of jurisdiction. Accordingly a much larger proportion of our people are engaged in maritime affairs. We ought therefore to be particularly attentive to securing so great an [484]interest. It is vain to tell us, that we ought to overlook local interest. It is only by protecting local concerns, that the interest of the whole is preserved. No man when he enters into society, does it from a view to promote the good of others, but he does it for his own good. All men having the same view, are bound equally to promote the welfare of the whole. To recur then to such a principle as that local interests must be disregarded, is requiring of one man to do more than another, and is subverting the foundation of a free government. The Philadelphians would be shocked with a proposition to place the seat of general government and the unlimited right to regulate trade in the Massachusetts. There can be no greater reason for our surrendering the preference to them. Such sacrifices, however we may delude ourselves with the form of words, always originate in folly, and not in generosity. Let me now request your attention a little while to the actual state of Publick credit, that we may see, whether it has not been as much misrepresented as the state of our trade. A the beginning of the present year, the whole continental debt was about twelve millions of pounds in our money. About one quarter part of this sum was due to our foreign creditors. Of these France was the principal, and called for the arrears of interest. A new loan of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds was negotiated in Holland, at five per cent, to pay the arrears due to France.2 At first sight this has the appearance of bad economy, and has been used for the villainous purpose of disaffecting the people. But in the course of this same year, Congress have negotiated the sale of as much of their western lands on the Ohio and Missis[s]ippi, as amount nearly to the whole sum of the foreign debt;3 and instead of a dead loss by borrowing money at five per cent, to the amount of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds, in one sum, they make a saving of the interest at six per cent. on three millions of their domestick debt, which is an annual saving of an hundred and eighty thousand pounds. It is easy to see how such an immense fund as the western territory may be applied to the payment of the foreign debt. Purchasers of the land would as willingly procure any kind of the produce of the United States as they would buy loan-office certificates to pay for the land. The produce thus procured would easily be negotiated for the benefit of our foreign creditors. I do not mean to insinuate that no other provision should be made for our creditors, but only to shew that our credit is not so bad in other countries as has been represented, and that our resources are fully equal to the pressure. The perfection of government depends on the equality of its operation, as far as human affairs will admit, upon all parts of the empire, [485]and upon all the citizens. Some inequalities indeed will necessarily take place. One man will be obliged to travel a few miles further than another man to procure justice. But when he has travelled, the poor man ought to have the same measure of justice as the rich one. Small inequalities may be easily compensated. There ought, however, to be no inequality in the law itself, and the government ought to have the same authority in one place as in another. Evident as this truth is, the most plausible argument in favour of the new plan is drawn from the inequality of its operation in different states. In Connecticut, they have been told that the bulk of the revenue will be raised by impost and excise, and therefore they need not be afraid to trust Congress with the power of levying a dry tax at pleasure. New-York, and Massachusetts are both more commercial states than Connecticut. The latter, therefore, hopes that the other two will pay the bulk of the continental expense. The argument is in itself delusive. If the trade is not overtaxed, the consumer pays it. If the trade is over-taxed, it languishes, and by the ruin of trade the farmer loses his market. The farmer has in truth no other advantage from imposts than that they save him the trouble of collecting money for the government. He neither gets or loses money by changing the mode of taxation. The government indeed finds it the easiest way to raise the revenue; and the reason is that the tax is by this means collected where the money circulates most freely. But if the argument was not delusive, it ought to conclude against the plan, because it would prove the unequal operation of it, and if any saving is to be made by the mode of taxing, the saving should be applied towards our own debt, and not to the payment of that part of the continental burden which Connecticut ought to discharge. It would be impossible to refute in writing all the delusions made use of to force this system through. Those respecting the publick debt, and the benefit of imposts, are the most important, and these I have taken pains to explain. In one instance indeed, the impost does raise money at the direct expense of the seaports. This is when goods are imported subject to a duty, and re-exported without a drawback. Whatever benefit is derived from this source, surely should not be transferred to another state, at least till our own debts are cleared. Another instance of unequal operation is, that it establishes different degrees of authority in different states, and thus creates different interests. The lands in New-Hampshire having been formerly granted by this state, and afterwards by that state, to private persons, the whole authority of trying titles becomes vested in a continental court, and that state loses a branch of authority, which the others retain, over their own citizens. I have now gone through two parts of my argument, and have proved the efficiency of the state governments for internal regulation, and the disadvantages of the new system, at least some of the principal. The argument has been much longer than I at first apprehended, or, possibly, I should have been deterred from it. The importance of the question has, however, prevented me from relinquishing it."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/25/1787,"To the PEOPLE. It has been proved, by indisputable evidence, that power is not the grand principle of union among the parts of a very extensive empire; and that when this principle is pushed beyond the degree necessary for rendering justice between man and man, it debases the character of individuals, and renders them less secure in their persons and property. Civil liberty consists in the consciousness of that security, and is best guarded by political liberty, which is the share that every citizen has in the government. Accordingly all our accounts agree, that in those empires which are commonly called despotick, and which comprehend by far the greatest part of the world, the government is most fluctuating, and property least secure. In those countries insults are borne by the sovereign, which, if offered to one of our governours, would fill us with horrour, and we should think the government dissolving. The common conclusion from this reasoning is an exceedingly unfair one, that we must then separate, and form distinct confederacies. This would be true, if there was no principle to substitute in the room of power. Fortunately there is one. This is commerce. All the states have local advantages, and in a considerable degree separate interests. They are, therefore, in a situation to supply each other’s wants. Carolina, for instance, is inhabited by planters, while the Massachusetts is more engaged in commerce and manufactures. Congress has the power of deciding their differences. The most friendly intercourse may therefore [516]be established between them. A diversity of produce, wants and interests. Produces commerce, and commerce, where there is a common, equal and moderate authority to preside, produces friendship. The same principles apply to the connection with the new settlers in the west Many supplies they want, for which they must look to the older settlements, and the greatness of their crops enables them to make payments. Here then we have a bond of union which applies to all parts of the empire, and would continue to operate if the empire comprehended all America.2 We are now, in the strictest sense of the terms, a federal republick. Each part has within its own limits the sovereignty over its citizens, while some of the general concerns are committed to Congress. The complaints of the deficiency of the Congressional powers are confined to two articles. They are not able to raise a revenue by taxation, and they have not a complete regulation of the intercourse between us and foreigners. For each of these complaints there is some foundation, but not enough to justify the clamour which has been raised. Congress, it is true, owes a debt which ought to be paid. A considerable part of it has been paid. Our share of what remains would annually amount to about sixty or seventy thousand pounds. If, therefore, Congress were put in possession of such branches of the impost as would raise this sum in our state, we should fairly be considered as having done our part towards their debt; and our remaining resources, whether arising from impost, excise, or dry tax, might be applied to the reduction of our own debt. The principal of this last amounts to about thirteen hundred thousand pounds, and the interest to between seventy or eighty thousand. This is, surely, too much property to be sacrificed; and it is as reasonable that it should be paid as the continental debt. But if the new system should be adopted, the whole impost, with an unlimited claim to excise and dry tax, will be given to Congress. There will remain no adequate fund for the state debt, and the state will still be subject to be sued on their notes.—This is, then, an article which ought to be limited. We can, without difficulty, pay as much annually as shall clear the interest of our state debt, and our share of the interest on the continental one. But if we surrender the impost, we shall still, by this new constitution, be held to pay our full proportion of the remaining debt, as if nothing had been done. The impost will not be considered as being paid by this state, but by the continent. The federalists, indeed, tell us, that the state debts will all be incorporated with the continental debt, and all paid out of one fund. In this, as in all other instances, they endeavour to support their scheme of consolidation by delusion. Not one word is said in the book3 in favour of such a scheme, and there [517]is no reason to think it true. Assurances of that, sort are easily given, and as easily forgotten. There is an interest in forgetting what is false. No man can expect town debts to be united with that of the state; and there will be as little reason to expect, that the state and continental debts will be united together."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,12/28/1787,"To the PEOPLE. We come now to the second and last article of complaint against the present confederation, which is, that Congress has not the sole power to regulate the intercourse between us and foreigners. Such a power extends not only to war and peace, but to trade and naturalization. This last article ought never to be given them; for though most of the state-; may be willing for certain reasons to receive foreigners as citizens, yet reasons of equal weight may induce other states, differently circumstanced, to keep their blood pure. Pennsylvania has chosen to receive all that would come there. Let any indifferent person judge whether that state in point of morals, education, energy is equal to any of the eastern states; the small state of Rhode-Island only excepted. Pennsylvania in the course of a century has acquired her present extent and population, at the expense of religion and good morals. The eastern states have, by keeping separate from the foreign mixtures, acquired their present greatness in the course of a century and an half, and have preserved their religion and morals. They have also preserved that manly virtue which is equally fitted for rendering them respectable in war, and industrious in peace. The remaining power for peace and trade might perhaps be safely enough lodged with Congress under some limitations. Three restrictions appear to me to be essentially necessary to preserve that equality of rights to the states, which it is the object of the state governments to secure to each citizen. 1st. It ought not to be in the power of Congress either by treaty or otherwise to alienate part of any state without the consent of the legislature. 2d. They ought not to be able by treaty or other law to give any legal preference to one part above another. 3d. They ought to be restrained from creating any monopolies. Perhaps others may propose different regulations and restrictions. One of these is to be found in the old confederation, and another in the newly proposed plan. The third seems to be equally necessary. After all that has been said and written on this subject, and on the difficulty of amending our old constitution so as to render it adequate to national purposes, it does not appear that any thing more was necessary to be done, than framing two new articles. By one a limited revenue would be given to Congress with a right to collect it, and by the other a limited right to regulate our intercourse with foreign nations. By such an addition we should have preserved to each state its power to defend the rights of the citizens, and the whole empire would be capable of expanding, and receiving additions without altering its former constitution. Congress, at the same lime, by the extent of their jurisdiction, and the number of their officers, would have acquired more respectability at home, and a sufficient influence abroad. If any state was in such a case to invade the rights of the Union, the other states would join in defence of those rights, and it would be in the power of Congress to direct the national force to that object. But it is certain that the powers of Congress over the citizens should be small in proportion as the empire is extended; that, in order to preserve the balance, each state may supply by energy what is wanting in numbers. Congress would be able by such a system as we have proposed to regulate trade with foreigners by such duties as should effectually give the preference to the produce and manufactures of our own country. We should then have a friendly intercourse established between the states, upon the principles of mutual interest. A moderate duty upon foreign vessels would give an advantage to our own people, while it would avoid all the [dis]advantages arising from a prohibition, and the consequent deficiency of vessels to transport the produce of the southern states. Our country is at present upon an average a thousand miles long from north to south, and eight hundred broad from the Missisippi to the Ocean. We have at least six millions of white inhabitants,2 and the annual increase is about two hundred and fifty thousand souls, exclusive of emigrants from Europe. The greater part of our increase is employed in settling the new lands, while the older settlements are entering largely into manufactures of various kinds. It is probable, that the extraordinary exertions of this state in the way of industry for the present year only, exceed in value five hundred thousand pounds. The new settlements, if all made in the same tract of country, would form a large state annually; and the time seems to be literally accomplished when a nation shall be born in a day. Such an immense country is not only capable of yielding all the produce of Europe, but actually does produce by far the greater part of the raw materials. The restrictions on our trade in Europe, necessarily oblige us to make use of those materials, and the high price of labour operates as an encouragement [542]to mechanical improvements. In this way we daily make rapid advancements towards independence in resources as well as in empire. If we adopt the new system of government we shall by one rash vote lose the fruit of the toil and expense of thirteen years, at the time when the benefits of that toil and expense are rapidly increasing. Though the imposts of Congress on foreign trade may tend to encourage manufactures, the excise and dry tax will destroy all the beneficial effects of the impost, at the same time that they diminish our capital. Be careful then to give only a limited revenue, and the limited power of managing foreign concerns. Once surrender the rights of internal legislation and taxation, and instead of being respected abroad, foreigners will laugh at us and posterity will lament our folly."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,12/28/1787,"Mr. Hayes, It was the wish of many respectable characters both in the House of Assembly, and others, that the information received from the Delegates to the late Convention, should be made public.2—I have taken some pains, to collect together, the substance of the information, which was given on that occasion to the House of Delegates by Mr. Martin; by your inserting it in your paper, you will oblige a customer. Mr. MARTIN, when called upon, addressed the House nearly as follows: Mr. Speaker, Since I was notified of the resolve of this Honourable House, that we should attend this day, to give information with regard to the proceedings of the late convention, my time has necessarily been taken up with business, and I have also been obliged to make a journey to the Eastern-Shore: These circumstances have prevented me from being as well prepared as I could wish, to give the information required—However, the few leisure moments I could spare, I have devoted to refreshing my memory, by looking over the papers and notes in my possession; and shall with pleasure, to the best of my abilities, render an account of my conduct. It was not in my power to attend the convention immediately on my appointment—I took my seat, I believe, about the eighth or ninth of June. I found that Governor Randolph, of Virginia, had laid before the convention certain propositions for their consideration, which have been read to this House by my Honourable colleague, and I believe, he has very faithfully detailed the substance of the speech with which the business of the convention was opened, for though I was not there at the time, I saw notes which had been taken of it.3—The members of the convention from the States, came there under different powers. The greatest number, I believe under powers, nearly the same as those of the delegates of this State4—Some came to the convention under the former appointment, authorising the meeting of delegates merely to regulate trade.—Those of Delaware were expressly instructed to agree to no system which should take away from the States, that equality of suffrage secured by the original articles of confederation. Before I arrived, a number of rules had been adopted to regulate the proceedings of the convention, by one of which, seven States might proceed to business, [129]and consequently four States, the majority of that number, might eventually have agreed upon a system which was to effect the whole Union. By another, the doors were to be shut, and the whole proceedings were to be kept secret; and so far did this rule extend, that we were thereby prevented from corresponding with gentlemen in the different States upon the subjects under our discussion—a circumstance, Sir, which I confess, I greatly regretted—I had no idea that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of this State, or of the others, were centered in the convention—I wished to have corresponded freely, and confidentially, with eminent political characters in my own, and other States, not implicitly to be dictated to by them, but to give their sentiments due weight and consideration. So extremely solicitous were they, that their proceedings should not transpire, that the members were prohibited even from taking copies of resolutions, on which the convention were deliberating, or extracts of any kind from the journals without formally moving for, and obtaining permission, by a vote of the convention for that purpose. You have heard, Sir, the resolutions which were brought forward by the honourable member from Virginia—let me call the attention of this House, to the conduct of Virginia, when our confederation was entered into—That State then proposed, and obstinately contended, contrary to the sense of, and unsupported by the other States, for an inequality of suffrage founded on numbers, or some such scale, which should give her, and certain other States, influence in the Union over the rest—pursuant to that spirit which then characterized her, and uniform in her conduct, the very second resolve, is calculated expressly for that purpose to give her a representation proportioned to her numbers, as if the want of that was the principle defect in our original system, and this alteration the great means of remedying the evils we had experienced under our present government. The object of Virginia and other large States, to increase their power and influence over the others, did not escape observation—The subject, however, was discussed with great coolness in the committee of the whole House (for the convention had resolved itself into a committee of the whole to deliberate upon the propositions delivered in by the honourable member from Virginia). Hopes were formed, that the farther we proceeded in the examination of the resolutions, the better the House might be satisfied of the impropriety of adopting them, and that they would finally be rejected by a majority of the committee—If on the contrary, a majority should report in their favour, it was considered that it would not preclude the members from bringing forward and submitting any other system to the consideration of the convention; and accordingly, while those resolves were the subject of discussion in the [130]committee of the whole House, a number of the members who disapproved them, were preparing another system, such as they thought more conducive to the happiness and welfare of the States—The propositions originally submitted to the convention having been debated, and undergone a variety of alterations in the course of our proceedings, the committee of the whole House by a small majority agreed to a report, which I am happy, Sir, to have in my power to lay before you5—It was as follow: 1. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that a national government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme, legislative, judiciary and executive. 2. That the legislative ought to consist of two branches. 3. That the members of the first branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several States, for the term of three years, to receive fixed stipends, by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the national treasury, to be ineligible to any office established by a particular State, or under the authority of the United States, except those particularly belonging to the functions of the first branch, during the term of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 4. That the members of the second branch of the legislature ought to be chosen by the individual legislatures, to be of the age of thirty years at least, to hold their offices for a term sufficient to ensure their independency, namely, seven years, one third to go out biennially, to receive fixed stipends, by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the national treasury, to be ineligible to any office by a particular State, or under the authority of the United States, except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch, during the term of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 5. That each branch ought to possess the right of originating acts. 6. That the national legislature ought to be empowered to enjoy the legislative rights vested in Congress by the confederation, and moreover, to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted, by the exercise of individual legislation; to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening, in the opinion of the legislature of the United States, the articles of union, or any treaties subsisting under the authority of the Union. 7. That the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national legislature, ought not to be according to the rule established in the articles of confederation, but according to some equitable rate of representation, namely, [131]in proportion to the whole number of white, and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age, sex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of years, and three fifths of all other persons, not comprehended in the foregoing description, except Indians not paying taxes in each State. 8. That the right of suffrage in the second branch of the national legislature, ought to be according to the rule established in the first. 9. That a national executive be instituted to consist of a single person, to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of seven years, with power to carry into execution the national laws, to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for, to be ineligible a second time, and to be removable on impeachment and conviction of malpractice or neglect of duty, to receive a fixed stipend, by which he may be compensated for the devotion of his time to public service—to be paid out of the national treasury. 10. That the national executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act which shall not afterwards be passed, unless by two third parts of each branch of the national legislature. 11. That a national judiciary be established, to consist of one supreme tribunal, the judges of which, to be appointed by the second branch of the national legislature, to hold their offices during good behaviour, and to receive punctually, at stated times, a fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase or diminution shall be made, so as to affect the persons actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution. 12. That the national legislature be empowered to appoint inferior tribunals. 13. That the jurisdiction of the national judiciary shall extend to cases which respect the collection of the national revenue; cases arising under the laws of the United States—impeachments of any national officer, and questions which involve the national peace and harmony. 14. Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the admission of States lawfully arising within the limits of the United States whether from a voluntary junction of government, territory, or otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole. 15. Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the continuance of Congress, and their authority and privileges, until a given day after the reform of the articles of union shall be adopted, and for the completion of all their engagements. 16. That a republican constitution and its existing laws ought to be guarranteed to each State by the United States. 17. That provision ought to be made for the amendment of the articles of union, whensoever it shall seem necessary. 18. That the legislative, executive and judiciary powers, within the several States, ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of the union. 19. That the amendments which shall be offered to the confederation by this convention, ought, at a proper time or times, after the approbation of Congress, to be submitted to an assembly or assemblies, recommended by the legislatures, to be expressly chosen by the people to consider and decide thereon. These propositions, Sir, were acceeded to by a majority of the members of the committee—a system by which the large States were to have not only an inequality of suffrage in the first branch, but also the same inequality in the second branch, or senate; however, it was not designed the second branch should consist of the same number as the first. It was proposed that the senate should consist of twenty-eight members, formed on the following scale—Virginia to send five, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts each four, South-Carolina, North-Carolina, Maryland, New-York, and Connecticut two each, and the States of New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Jersey, Delaware, and Georgia each of them one;6 upon this plan, the three large States, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, would have thirteen senators out of twenty-eight, almost one half of the whole number—Fifteen senators were to be a quorum to proceed to business; those three States would, therefore, have thirteen out of that quorum. Having this inequality in each branch of the legislature, it must be evident, Sir, that they would make what laws they pleased, however disagreeable or injurious to the other States, and that they would always prevent the other States from making any laws, however necessary and proper, if not agreeable to the views of those three States—They were not only, Sir, by this system, to have such an undue superiority in making laws and regulations for the Union, but to have the same superiority in the appointment of the president, the judges, and all other officers of government. Hence, those three States would in reality have the appointment of the president, judges, and all the other officers. This president, and these judges, so appointed, we may be morally certain would be citizens of one of those three States; and the president, as appointed by them, and a citizen of one of them, would espouse their interests and their views, when they came in competition with the views and interests of the other States. This president, so appointed by the three large States, and so unduly under their influence, was to have a negative upon every law that should be passed, which, if negatived by him, was not to take effect, unless assented to by two thirds of each branch of the legislatures, a provision which deprived ten States of even the faintest shadow of liberty; for if they, by a miraculous unanimity, having all their members present, should outvote the [133]other three, and pass a law contrary to their wishes, those three large States need only procure the president to negative it, and thereby prevent a possibility of its ever taking effect, because the representatives of those three States would amount to much more than one third (almost one half) of the representatives in each branch. And, Sir, this government, so organized with all this undue superiority in those three large States, was as you see to have a power of negativing the laws passed by every State legislature in the Union. Whether, therefore, laws passed by the legislature of Maryland, New-York, Connecticut, Georgia, or of any other of the ten States, for the regulation of their internal police, should take effect, and be carried into execution, was to depend on the good pleasure of the representatives of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This system of slavery, which bound hand and foot ten States in the Union, and placed them at the mercy of the other three, and under the most abject and servile subjection to them, was approved by a majority of the members of the convention, and reported by the committee. On this occasion, the House will recollect, that the convention was resolved into a committee of the whole—of this committee Mr. Gorham was chairman—The honorable Mr. Washington was then on the floor, in the same situation with any other member of the convention at large, to oppose any system he thought injurious, or to propose any alterations or amendments he thought beneficial, to these propositions so reported by the committee, no opposition was given by that illustrious personage, or by the president of the State of Pennsylvania.7 They both appeared cordially to approve them, and to give them their hearty concurrence; yet this system, I am confident, Mr. Speaker, there is not a member in this house would advocate, or who would hesitate one moment in saying it ought to be rejected. I mention this circumstance in compliance with the duty I owe this honorable body, not with a view to lessen those exalted characters, but to shew how far the greatest and best of men may be led to adopt very improper measures, through error in judgment, State influence, or by other causes, and to shew that it is our duty not to suffer our eyes to be so far dazzled by the splendor of names, as to run blindfolded into what may be our destruction. Mr. Speaker, I revere those illustrious personages as much as any man here. No man has a higher sense of the important services they have rendered this country. No member of the convention went there more disposed to pay a deference to their opinions; but I should little have deserved the trust this State reposed in me, if I could have sacrificed its dearest interests to my complaisance for their sentiments. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,12/29/1787,"To The MEMBERS of The CONVENTION of massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, You are called on, and will soon convene to conduct a matter of the last importance to your country—the confidence of your constituents in your abilities and integrity can never be more fully expressed, than by their suffrages on the present occasion—and on your wisdom and firmness is in a great measure suspended, the fate of the United States. In a free State like this, and under such circumstances, every individual must be anxious at the approach of an event, which will entail happiness or misery, not only on himself, his family, and the community, but also on his and their posterity:—The has therefore a right to address you, and your patriotism will prompt you to consider seriously, whatever shall be offered on the subject with reason and candour, and be worthy of your attention. Seneca I think has established this maxim, that in all concerns of life, we should enquire, first, what we want, and secondly, how we are to attain it?1—Apply these to the present case, and the answers are plain: We want a free, efficient federal government—and can only attain it, by a candid, dispassionate, discussion of the subject. A system of government has been proposed by the federal Convention: Some are for adopting, some for amending, and others for rejecting it: And when it is considered that a federal government must necessarily be more complicated in its nature, than a simple one, and that to form the latter, the ingenuity of man has never yet been able to establish fixed principles which will apply in all cases, is it a matter of surprize, that in forming a Federal Constitution, even sensible, disinterested men should differ in opinion, and require an investigation of their principles, in order to convince [551]each other, and to correct their mutual errours? Surely not, and the more calm and temperate their discussions are, the greater will be their prospect of success. Some able writers on both sides, have favoured us with their sentiments on the three great questions respecting the adoption, amendment, and rejection of the proposed plan of government, and we are much obliged to them for their diligent researches and ingenious remarks:—Others with little ability and less decency, have continually wounded the feelings of the publick, by railing against every one who has not subscribed their political creed; which if good in itself, would be rendered odious by the persecuting spirit of such ignorant zealots: But let them be informed, that their humour and petulance are not criterions for regulating the judgment of the publick; and that every individual has an equal right with themselves, to attend to the greatest of all earthly concerns, the establishment of good government.—Even the newspapers of Boston, have been thus disgraced.2 Boston has been famed for the liberality of its citizens, and for their attachment to liberty: And the reputation of so respectable a community should not be tarnished by illiberal productions. In investigating the subject of the proposed constitution, let us first inquire, upon what ground it stands: Because if it has no foundation, the superstructure must fall. The Federal Convention was first proposed by the legislature of Virginia, to whom America is much indebted for having taken the lead on the most important occasions.3—She first sounded the alarm respecting the intended usurpation and tyranny of Great-Britain, and has now proclaimed the necessity of more power and energy- in our federal government: But anxious as that wise State is for the attainment of these great objects, we find her not precipitate in adopting the new constitution. She has allowed herself time to consider the subject, and has deferred the meeting of her convention until May next—Several other States are of the same opinion, amongst which are the respectable States of New-York and Maryland.—Is it not then a matter worthy of your consideration, whether any disadvantage can result, nay, whether the greatest advantages may not accrue from an adjournment of the Convention of Massachusetts, until the sense of Virginia can be known? Too much light cannot be thrown on the subject, neither can a short delay possibly injure us; but an hasty decision may irretrievably ruin us. n consequence of the measures of Virginia respecting the calling a federal Convention, the legislature of this State on the 21st of February last. Resolved, “That five Commissioners be appointed by the General Court, who, or any three of whom, are hereby impowered to meet such commissioners as are or may be appointed by the legislatures of the [552]other States in the union, at Philadelphia, on the 2d day of May next; and with them to consider the trade and commerce of the United States, and how far an uniform system in their commercial intercourse and regulations may be necessary for their common interest and permanent harmony; and also to consider, how far it may be necessary to alter any of the articles of the present Confederation, so as to render the Constitution of the Federal Government more adequate to the exigencies of the union: And what further powers may be necessary to be vested in Congress for the common welfare and security, and with them to form a report for the purpose—such alterations and additions as may be made, to be however consistent, with the true republican spirit, and genius of the present articles of Confederation. Provided that the said Commissioners on the part of this Commonwealth, are hereby particularly instructed, by no means to interfere with the fifth of the articles of the Confederation, which provides for the annual election of delegates in congress, with a power reserved to each State, to recall its delegates, or any of them, within the year, and to send others in their stead for the remainder of the year—and which also provides that no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years, or being a delegate, shall be capable of holding any office under the United States, for which he or any other, for his benefit, receives any salary, fees, or emolument of any kind. “The report of the said Commissioners from the several legislatures to be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, to the intent, that if they shall judge it proper, they may recommend the said report or any part of it to the legislatures of the several States for their consideration: And if agreed to by them, that the same may become a part of the Confederation of the United States.”4 This was the resolution of Massachusetts, in consequence of the proposition of Virginia, but Congress having on the 21st of February,5 the same day on which this resolution passed, recommended a Federal Convention, our Legislature on the 7th of March last, repealed that, and massed the following resolve—“Whereas Congress did on the 21st day of February 1787, resolve, ‘That in the opinion of Congress, it is expedient that on the second Monday in May next, a Convention of Delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein, as shall when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by the States; render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union[’]—And whereas, the legislature of this Commonwealth did on the 3d day of the present month, elect the Hon. Francis Dana, Elbridge [553]Gerry, Nathaniel Gorham, Rufus King, and Caleb Strong, Esquires, delegates, or any three of them, to attend and represent this Common wealth at the aforesaid Convention for the sole and express purpose mentioned in the afore recited resolve of Congress, RESOLVED, That his Excellency the Governour be and he hereby is requested to grant to the said Francis Dana,” &c. “a commission agreeably to the said resolution of Congress.”6 The first of these resolves will shew that when the Legislature in February last, agreed to a Convention, the delegates of the State were to report measures not for abolishing but for preserving the articles of Confederation; for amending them; and for increasing their powers consistently with the true republican spirit and genius thereof—that the report was to have been made to Congress and that so much of it only as should be approved by them, and agreed to by the legislatures of the several States, was to become a part of the Confederation—the last of the resolves will shew, that in March last the legislature altered the powers of their delegates and conformed them to the resolve of Congress—that the utmost extent of this resolve, which united the views of Congress and our legislature, was to call a Convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the legislatures, such alterations and provisions therein as shall render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government, and the preservation of the union—that neither Congress nor the Legislature had the most distant idea of conducting the matter in a mode different from that presented by the Confederation, which provides “that the articles of Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union shall be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them, unless such alterations be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state.”7 That on the other hand, Congress in their resolve, and the legislature in both their resolves before recited, expressly provided, and they would have acted unconstitutionally to have done otherwise, that the alterations and provisions in the articles of Confederation, to have been reported by the Federal Convention, should be agreed to in Congress, and be confirmed by the legislative of the several States before they become part of the Federal Constitution."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/1/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. When contrary to our hopes it was found, that a majority of the members of the convention had in the committee agreed to the system, I have laid before you, we then thought it necessary to bring forward the propositions, which such of us who disapproved the plan before had prepared—The members who had prepared these resolutions were principally of the Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland delegations.—The honorable Mr. Patterson, of the Jerseys, laid them before the convention—of these propositions(a) I am in possession of a copy, which I shall beg leave to read to you.2 These propositions were referred to a committee of the whole house.—Unfortunately the New-Hampshire delegation had not yet arrived, and the sickness of a relation of the honorable Mr. McHenry, obliged him still to be absent, a circumstance, Sir, which I considered much to be regretted, as Maryland thereby was represented by only two delegates, and they unhappily differed very widely in their sentiments.3 The result of the referrence of these last propositions to a committee, was a speedy and hasty determination to reject them4—I doubt not, Sir, to those who consider them with attention, so sudden a rejection will appear surprising; but it may be proper to inform you, that on our meeting in convention, it was soon found there were among us three parties of very different sentiments and views. One party, whose object and wish it was to abolish and annihilate all State governments, and to bring forward one general government over [136]this extensive continent of a monarchical nature, under certain restrictions and limitations:—Those who openly avowed this sentiment were, it is true, but few, yet it is equally true, Sir, that there was a considerable number who did not openly avow it, who were by myself, and many others of the convention, considered as being in reality favourers of that sentiment, and acting upon those principles, covertly endeavouring to carry into effect what they well knew openly and avowedly could not be accomplished.5 The second party was not for the abolition of the State governments, nor for the introduction of a monarchical government under any form; but they wished to establish such a system as would give their own States undue power and influence in the government over the other States.—A third party was what I considered truly federal and republican—This party was nearly equal in number with the other two, and were composed of the delegations from Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Delaware, and in part from Maryland; also of some individuals from other representations.—This party, Sir, were for proceeding upon terms of federal equality; they were for taking our present federal system as the basis of their proceedings, and as far as experience had shewn us that there were defects, to remedy those defects, as far as experience had shewn that other powers were necessary to the federal government, to give those powers—They considered this, the object for which they were sent by their State, and what their States expected from them—They urged, that if after doing this, experience should shew that there still were defects in the system (as no doubt there would be) the same good sense that induced this convention to be called, would cause the States when they found it necessary to call another; and if that convention should act with the same moderation, the members of it would proceed to correct such errors and defects as experience should have brought to light—That by proceeding in this train, we should have a prospect at length of obtaining as perfect a system of federal government, as the nature of things would admit. On the other hand, if we, contrary to the purpose for which we were intrusted, considering ourselves as master-builders, too proud to amend our original government, should demolish it entirely, and erect a new system of our own, a short time might shew the new system as defective as the old, perhaps more so—Should a convention be found necessary again, if the members thereof acting upon the same principles, instead of amending and correcting its defects, should demolish that entirely, and bring forward a third system, that also might soon be found no better than either of the former, and thus we might always remain young in government, and always suffering the inconveniences of an incorrect, imperfect system. But, Sir, the favourers of monarchy, and those who wished the total abolition of State governments, well knowing that a government founded on truly federal principles, the basis of which were the Thirteen State governments, preserved in full force and energy, would be destructive of their views; and knowing they were too weak in numbers, openly to bring forward their system, conscious also that the people of America would reject it if proposed to them, joined their interest with that party, who wished a system, giving particular States the power and influence over the others, procuring in return mutual sacrifices from them, in giving the government great and undefined powers as to its legislative and executive, well knowing that by departing from a federal system, they paved the way for their favourite object, the destruction of the State governments, and the introduction of monarchy—And hence, Mr. Speaker, I apprehend, in a great measure, arose the objections of those honorable members Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry.6 In every thing that tended to give the large States power over the smaller, the first of those gentlemen could not forget he belonged to the ancient dominion, nor could the latter forget that he represented Old Massachusetts; that part of the system which tended to give those States power over the others, met with their perfect approbation; but when they viewed it charged with such powers as would destroy all State governments, their own as well as the rest—when they saw a president so constituted as to differ from a monarch, scarcely but in name, and having it in his power to become such in reality when he pleased; they being republicans and federalists as far as an attachment to their own States would permit them, they warmly and zealously opposed those parts of the system. From these different sentiments, and from this combination of interest, I apprehend, Sir, proceeded the fate of what was called the Jersey resolutions, and the report made by the committee of the whole house. The Jersey propositions being thus rejected, the convention took up those reported by the committee, and proceeded to debate them by paragraphs7—It was now that they who disapproved the report found it necessary to make a warm and decided opposition, which took place upon the discussion of the seventh resolution, which related to the inequality of representation in the first branch.—Those who advocated this inequality, urged, that when the articles of confederation were formed, it was only from necessity and expediency that the States were admitted each to have an equal vote; but that our situation was now altered, and therefore those States who considered it contrary to their interest, would no longer abide by it. They said no State ought to wish to have influence in government, except in proportion to what it contributes to it; that if it contributes but little, it ought to have but a small vote; that taxation and representation ought always to go together; that if [138]one State had sixteen times as many inhabitants as another, or was sixteen times as wealthy, it ought to have sixteen times as many votes; that an inhabitant of Pennsylvania ought to have as much weight and consequence as an inhabitant of Jersey or Delaware; that it was contrary to the feelings of the human mind—what the large States would never submit to; that the large States would have great objects in view, in which they would never permit the smaller States to thwart them; that equality of suffrage was the rotten part of the constitution, and that this was a happy time to get clear of it. In fine, that it was the poison which contaminated our whole system, and the source of all the evils we experienced.8 This, Sir, is the substance of the arguments, if arguments they can be called, which were used in favour of inequality of suffrage.—Those, who advocated the equality of suffrage, took the matter up on the original principles of government—They urged that all men considered in a state of nature, before any government formed, are equally free and independent, no one having any right or authority to exercise power over another, and this without any regard to difference in personal strength, understanding, or wealth—That when such individuals enter into government, they have each a right to an equal voice in its first formation, and afterwards have each a right to an equal vote in every matter which relates to their government—That if it could be done conveniently, they have a right to exercise it in person—Where it cannot be done in person but for convenience, representatives are appointed to act for them, every person has a right to an equal vote in choosing that representative who is entrusted to do for the whole, that which the whole, if they could assemble, might do in person, and in the transacting of which each would have an equal voice—That if we were to admit, because a man was more wise, more strong, or more wealthy, he should be entitled to more votes than another, it would be inconsistent with the freedom and liberty of that other, and would reduce him to slavery—Suppose, for instance, ten individuals in a state of nature, about to enter into government, nine of whom are equally wise, equally strong, and equally wealthy, the tenth is ten times as wise, ten times as strong or ten times as rich; if for this reason he is to have ten votes for each vote of either of the others, the nine might as well have no vote at all, since though the whole nine might assent to a measure, yet the vote of the tenth would countervail, and set aside all their votes—If this tenth approved of what they wished to adopt, it would be well, but if he disapproved, he could prevent it, and in the same manner he could carry into execution any measure he wished contrary to the opinion of all the others, he having ten votes, and the other all together but nine—It is evident, that on these principles, the nine would have no will nor discretion of their own, but must be totally dependent on the will [139]and discretion of the tenth, to him they would be as absolutely slaves as any negro is to his master.—If he did not attempt to carry into execution any measures injurious to the other nine, it could only be said that they had a good master, they would not be the less slaves, because they would be totally dependent on the will of another, and not on their own will—They might not feel their chains, but they would notwithstanding wear them, and whenever their master pleased he might draw them so tight as to gall them to the bone. Hence it was urged the inequality of representation, or giving to one man more votes than another on account of his wealth, &c. was altogether inconsistent with the principles of liberty, and in the same proportion as it should be adopted, in favour of one or more, in that proportion are the others inslaved—It was urged that though every individual should have an equal voice in the government, yet, even then superiour wealth, strength or understanding, would give great and undue advantages to those who possessed them. That wealth attracts respect and attention; superior strength would cause the weaker and more feeble to be cautious how they offended, and to put up with small injuries rather than to engage in an unequal contest—In like manner superior understanding would give its possessor many opportunities of profiting at the expence of the more ignorant.—Having thus established these principles with respect to the rights of individuals in a state of nature, and what is due to each on entering into government, principles established by every writer on liberty, they proceeded to shew that States, when once formed, are considered with respect to each other as individuals in a state of nature—That, like individuals, each State is considered equally free and equally independent, the one having no right to exercise authority over the other, though more strong, more wealthy, or abounding with more inhabitants—That when a number of States unite themselves under a federal government, the same principles apply to them as when a number of individual men unite themselves under a State government—That every argument which shews one man ought not to have more votes than another, because he is wiser, stronger or wealthier, proves that one State ought not to have more votes than another, because it is stronger, richer, or more populous—And that by giving one State, or one or two States more votes than the others, the others thereby are enslaved to such State or States, having the greater number of votes, in the same manner as in the case before put of individuals where one has more votes than the others—That the reason why each individual man in forming a State government should have an equal vote is, because each individual before he enters into government is equally free and independent—So each State, when States enter into a federal government, are entitled to an equal vote, because before they entered into such federal government, each State was equally free and [140]equally independent—That adequate representation of men formed into a State government, consists in each man having an equal voice either personally, or if by representatives, that he should have an equal voice in choosing the representative—So adequate representation of States in a federal government, consists in each State having an equal voice either in person or by its representative in every thing which relates to the federal government—That this adequacy of representation is more important in a federal, than in a State government, because the members of a State government, the district of which is not very large, have generally such a common interest, that laws can scarcely be made by one part oppressive to the others, without their suffering in common; but the different States composing an extensive federal empire, widely distant, one from the other, may have interests so totally distinct, that the one part might be greatly benefited by what would be destructive to the other. They were not satisfied by resting it on principles; they also appealed to history—They shewed that in the amphyctionic confederation of the Grecian cities, each city however different in wealth, strength, and other circumstances, sent the same number of deputies, and had each an equal voice in every thing that related to the common concerns of Greece. It was shewn that in the seven provinces of the United Netherlands, and the confederated Cantons of Switzerland, each Canton and each province have an equal vote, although there are as great distinctions of wealth, strength, population, and extent of territory among those provinces and those Cantons, as among these States. It was said, that the maxim that taxation and representation ought to go together, was true so far, that no person ought to be taxed who is not represented, but not in the extent insisted upon, to wit, that the quantum of taxation and representation ought to be the same; on the contrary, ⟨the quantum of representation depends upon the quantum of freedom, and therefore all, whether individual States, or individual men, who are equally free, have a right to equal representation⟩9—That to those who insist that he who pays the greatest share of taxes, ought to have the greatest number of votes; it is a sufficient answer to say, that this rule would be destructive of the liberty of the others, and would render them slaves to the more rich and wealthy—That if one man pays more taxes than another, it is because he has more wealth to be protected by government, and he receives greater benefits from the government—So if one State pays more to the federal government, it is because as a State, she enjoys greater blessings from it; she has more wealth protected by it, or a greater number of inhabitants, whose rights are secured, and who share its advantages.

Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/1/1788,"To the PEOPLE. Friends and Brethren, It is a duty incumbent on every man, who has had opportunities for inquiry to lay the result of his researches on any matter of publick importance before the publick eye. No further apology will be necessary with the generality of my readers, for having so often appeared before them on the subject of the lately proposed form of government. It has been treated with that freedom which is necessary or the investigation of truth, and with no greater freedom. On such a subject, extensive in its nature, and important in its consequences, the examination has necessarily been long, and the topicks treated of have been various. We have been obliged to take a cursory, but not inaccurate view of the circumstances of mankind under the different forms of government to support the different parts of our argument. Permit me now to bring into one view the principal propositions on which the reasoning depends. It is shewn1 from the example of the most commercial republick of antiquity, which was never disturbed by a sedition for above seven hundred years, and at last yielded after a violent struggle to a foreign enemy,2 as well as from the experience of our own country for a century and an half; that the republican, more than any other form of government is made of durable materials. It is shewn from a variety of proof, that one consolidated government is inapplicable to a great extent of country; is unfriendly to the rights both of persons and property, which rights always adhere together; and that being contrary to the interest of the extreme of an empire, such a government can be supported only by power, and that commerce is the true bond of union for a free state. It is shewn from a comparison of the different parts of the proposed plan, that it is such a consolidated government. By article 3, section 2, Congress are empowered to appoint courts with authority to try civil causes of every kind, and even offences against particular states; by the last clause of article 1, section 8, which defines their legislative powers, they are authorised to make laws for carrying into execution all the “powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof;” and by article 6, the judges in every state are to be bound by the laws of Congress. It is therefore a complete consolidation of all the states into one, however diverse the parts of it may be. It is also shewn that it will operate unequally in the different states, taking from some of them a greater share of wealth; that in this last respect it will operate more to the injury of [577]this commonwealth than of any state in the union; and that by reason of its inequality it is subversive of the principles of a free government, which requires every part to contribute an equal proportion. For all these reasons this system ought to be rejected, even if no better plan was proposed in the room of it. In case of a rejection we must remain as we are, with trade extending, resources opening, settlements enlarging, manufactures increasing, and publick debts diminishing by fair payment. These are mighty blessings, and not to be lost by the hasty adoption of a new system. But great as these benefits are, which we derive from our present system, it has been shewn, that they may be increased by giving Congress a limited power to regulate trade, and assigning to them those branches of the impost on our foreign trade only, which shall be equal to our proportion of their present annual demands. While the interest is thus provided for, the sale of our lands in a very few years will pay the principal, and the other resources of the state will pay our own debt. The present mode of assessing the continental tax is regulated by the extent of landed property in each state.3 By this rule the Massachusetts has to pay one eighth. If we adopt the new system, we shall surrender the whole of our impost and excise, which probably amount to a third of those duties of the whole continent, and must come in for about a sixth part of the remaining debt. By this means we shall be deprived of the benefit arising from the largeness of our loans to the continent, shall lose our ability to satisfy the just demands on the state. Under the limitations of revenue and commercial regulation contained in these papers, the balance will be largely in our favour: the importance of the great states will be preserved, and the publick creditors both of the continent and state will be satisfied without burdening the people. For a more concise view of my proposal, I have thrown it into the form of a resolve supposed to be passed by the convention which is shortly to set in this town. “Commonwealth of Massachusetts. “Resolved, That the form of government lately proposed by a federal convention, held in the city of Philadelphia, is so far injurious to the interests of this commonwealth, that we are constrained by fidelity to our constituents to reject it; and we do hereby reject the said proposed form and every part thereof. But in order that the union of these states may, as far as possible, be promoted, and the federal business as little obstructed as may be, we do agree on the part of this commonwealth, that the following addition be made to the present articles of confederation. [“]XIV. The United States shall have power to regulate the intercourse between these states and foreign dominions, under the following restrictions, viz. 1st. No treaty, ordinance, or law shall alienate the [578]whole or part, of any state, without the consent of the legislature of such state. 2d. The United States shall not by treaty or otherwise give a preference to the ports of one state over those of another; nor, 3d. create any monopolies or exclusive companies; Nor, 4th, extend the privileges of citizenship to any foreigner. And for the more convenient exercise of the powers hereby, and by the former articles given, the United States shall have authority to constitute judicatories, whether supreme or subordinate, with power to try all piracies and felonies done on the high seas, and also all civil causes in which a foreign state, or subject thereof actually resident in a foreign country and not being British absentees, shall be one of the parties. They shall also have authority to try all causes in which ambassadours shall be concerned. All these trials shall be by jury and in some sea-port town. All imposts levied by Congress on trade shall be confined to foreign produce or foreign manufactures imported, and to foreign ships trading in our harbours, and all their absolute prohibitions shall be confined to the same articles. All imposts and confiscations shall be to the use of the state in which they shall accrue, excepting in such branches as shall be assigned by any state as a fund for defraying their proportion of the continental. And no powers shall be exercised by Congress but such as are expressly giver by this and the former articles. And we hereby authorize our delegates in Congress, to sign and ratify an article in the foregoing form and words, without any further act of this state for that purpose, provided the other states shall accede to this proposition on their part on or before the first day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord 1790. All matters of revenue being under the controul of the legislature, we reccommend to the general court of this commonwealth, to devise, as early as may be, such funds arising from such branches of foreign commerce, as shall be equal to our part of the current charges of the continent, and to put Congress in possession of the revenue arising therefrom, with a right to collect it, during such term as shall appear to be necessary for the payment of the principal of their debt, by the sale of the western lands.” By such an explicit declaration of the powers given to Congress, we shall provide for all federal purposes, and shall at the same time secure our rights. It is easier to amend the old confederation, defective as it has been represented, than it is to correct the new form. For with what ever view it was framed, truth constrains me to say, that it is insiduous in its form, and ruinous in its tendency. Under the pretence of different branches of the legislature, the members will in fact be chosen from the same general description of citizens. The advantages of a check will [579]be lost, while we shall be continually exposed to the cabals and corruption of a British election. There cannot be a more eligible mode than the present, for appointing members of Congress,4 nor more effectual checks provided than our separate state governments, nor any system so little expensive, in case of our adopting the resolve just stated, or even continuing as we are. We shall in that case avoid all the inconvenience of concurrent jurisdictions, we shall avoid the expensive and useless establishments of the Philadelphia proposition, we shall preserve our constitution and liberty, and we shall provide for all such institutions as will be useful. Surely then you cannot hesitate, whether you will chuse freedom or servitude. The object is now well defined. By adopting the form proposed by the convention, you will have the derision of foreigners, internal misery, and the anathemas of posterity. By amending the present confederation, and granting limited powers to Congress, you secure the admiration of strangers, internal happiness, and the blessings and prosperity of all succeeding generations. Be wise then, and by preserving your freedom, prove, that Heaven bestowed it not in vain. Many will be the efforts to delude the convention. The mode of judging is itself suspicious, as being contrary to the antient and established usage of the commonwealth. But since this mode is adopted, we trust, that the numbers of that venerable assembly will not so much regard the greatness of their power, as the sense and interest of their constituents. And they will do well to remember that even a mistake in adopting it, will be destructive, while no evils can arise from a total, and much less, probably, from such a partial rejection as we have proposed. I have now gone through my reasonings on this momentous subject, and have stated the facts and deductions from them, which you will verify for yourselves. Personal interest was not my object, or I should have pursued a different line of conduct. Though I conceived that a man who owes allegiance to the state, is bound, on all important occasions, to propose such inquiries as tend to promote the publick good; yet I did not imagine it to be any part of my duty to present myself to the fury of those, who appear to have other ends in view. For this cause, and for this only, I have chosen a feigned signature. At present all the reports concerning the writer of these papers are merely conjectural. I should have been ashamed of my system, if it had needed such feeble support as the character of individuals. It stands on the firm ground of the experience of mankind. I cannot conclude this long disquisition better, than with a caution derived from the words of inspiration. Discern the things of your peace now in the days thereof, before they be hidden from your eyes.5"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/2/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, It clearly appeared by the resolutions quoted in my last address,1 that the utmost extent of the views of Congress, and of the Legislature of this State; in calling a Federal Convention, was, that it should revise the articles of Confederation, and report such alterations and provisions therein, as shall render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and preservation of the union—that neither Congress or the Legislature had the most distant idea of conducting the matter in a mode different from that prescribed by the Confederation—but that on the other hand, they expressly provided, and would have acted unconstitutionally to have [590]done otherwise, that the proceedings of the Convention, before they become a part of the Federal Constitution, should be agreed to by Congress and confirmed by the Legislatures of the several states. No one I presume will deny that the powers of the delegates of this state, were as full and extensive as either Congress or any of the Legislatures had authority to give—that the powers of the other delegate[s] were in general, more limited—and that had any of them been more ample than those of Massachusetts, they must have been founded in usurpation and therefore have been null and void. And have the Federal Convention, in pursuance of their powers, reported the alterations and provisions mentioned in the recited resolve of Congress? If they have, let us call on Congress, to inform us, whether they have agreed to the report, and to transmit it when approved, to the Legislature for their consideration: This would be conducting upon constitutional principles, but the call would be vain, there is no such report, and the original design of forming the Convention has not been carried into effect. The Convention nevertheless have reported a new system, and the object of it is, a consolidation of the union. Mr. Wilson denies this fact, and says “if this was a just objection, it would be strongly against the system2 But unfortunately for that gentleman, his memory appears to be very defective, for he forgot that he has said, in the letter to Congress, signed “George Washington, president, by unanimous order of the Convention”—“In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American, the consolidation of the union.”3 There the Convention have candidly avowed their intentions, and how Mr. Wilson can reconcile his jarring and contradictory assertions, I am at a loss to determine. The Convention then having kept “steadily in view” “a consolidation of the union,” it is incumbent on every one who is zealous for the infallibility of the Convention, and liberal in abusing those who dare to think for themselves, to admit that the proposed plan compleatly embraces the object of consolidation, for otherwise he will call in question the ability of the Convention to execute their design—indeed it must be evident to every one who will attentively read the new system, that it secures to all intents and purposes the consolidation intended. And here permit me to remark on an argument, in favour of the new plan, often urged and drawn from the respectable characters of General Washington and Doctor Franklin: Let those gentlemen have every honour that can be paid them, they are justly entitled to it—but of what consequence is it to the publick, whether the members who assented or dissented to the new plan, were influenced by virtuous and disinterested, or by vicious and selfish motives? If the plan is properly before the States, is good, and will [591]secure to them “peace, liberty and safety” should it not be adopted, were they even sure that every member who subscribed it was in principle a Caligula or a Nero? And if the plan is bad and will entail slavery on the land, ought it not to be rejected should every subscriber excel in wisdom and integrity Lycurgus or Solon. Surely the good or bad effects of the system, depend not on the characters of the original framers, but on the system itself, and on those who may administer it; and no man of candour and discernment will urge characters, as an argument for or against this system, however respectable the characters of any particular members, or of the members in general of the federal convention, may be: They had no other authority to act in this matter, than what was derived from their commissions—when they ceased to act in conformity thereto, they ceased to be a federal convention, and had no more right to propose to the United States the new form of government, than an equal number of other gentlemen, who might voluntarily have assembled for this purpose—The members of the convention therefore, admitting they have the merit of a work of supererogation, have thereby inferred no kind of obligation on the States to consider, much less to adopt this plan of consolidation. The consolidation of the union! What a question is this, to be taken up and decided by thirty nine gentlemen,4 who had no publick authority whatever for discussing it!—To be submitted to the people at large, before it has been considered or even agitated by Congress, or any of the Legislatures, and to be transmitted with such precipitation to the States merely “for their assent and ratification?” True it is, that neither Congress or the Legislatures could decide this great question; the first are restrained by the confederation, and the last by the federal and state constitutions—but Congress and the Legislatures, if they thought it necessary, might at any time have considered the subject, expressed their sentiments on it, and recommended to the people an election of State conventions to have taken up the matter. Had this been done the important question would have been previously canvassed; and understood by Congress and the Legislatures; and explained to the people; and the publick opinion would have been thus united in some salutary measure—but as the matter has been conducted, a system of consolidation has been formed with the most profound secrecy, and without the least authority: And has been suddenly and without any previous notice transmitted by the federal convention for ratification—Congress not disposed to give any opinion on the plan, have transmitted it to the legislatures—The legislatures have followed the example, and sent it to the people. The people of this State, unassisted by Congress or their legislature, have not had time to investigate the subject, have referred to the newspapers for information, have been divided by contending writers, [592]and under such circumstances have elected members for the State Convention—and these members are to consider whether they will accept the plan of the federal convention, with ALL its imperfections, and bind the people by a system of government, of the nature and principles of which they have not at present a clearer idea, than they have of the Copernican system. What are we to expect, from such a mode of proceeding? Are not the people already thrown into great confusion? Are not heats, animosities, and a party spirit very prevalent and daily increasing? Are the citizens of this State in a proper temper to receive information, either of the ratification, or rejection, of the new constitution? Is there a probability of its being supported, if so precipitately adopted? Surely it must appear that the plan, although improperly before the State, cannot with safety be rejected—that it cannot as it stands, be safely accepted—that the people will not be satisfied with a ratification, and the delusive prospect of future alterations—and that the only hope that remains of preserving the peace and happiness of this Commonwealth, is from amending the plan in order to its adoption."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/4/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It was urged, that upon this system, the Pennsylvanian or inhabitant of a large State, was of as much consequence as the inhabitant of Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, or any other State—That his consequence was to be decided by his situation in his own State; that if he was there as free, if he had as great share in the forming of his own government, and in the making and executing its laws, as the inhabitants of those other States, then was he equally important and of equal consequence—Suppose a confederation of States had never been adopted, but every State had remained absolutely in its independent situation, no person could, with propriety, say that the citizen of the large State was not as important as the citizen of the smaller, the confederation of the States cannot alter the case. It was said that in all transactions between State and State, the freedom, independence, importance and consequence, even the individuality of each citizen of the different States, might with propriety be said to be swallowed up, or concentrated in the independence, the freedom and the individuality of the State of which they are citizens—That the Thirteen States are thirteen distinct political individual existences as to each other; that the federal government is or ought to be a government over these thirteen political individual existences, which form the members of that government—and that as the largest State is only a single individual of this government, it ought to have only one vote—the smallest State also being one individual member of this government, ought also to have one vote—To those who urged that the States having equal suffrage, was contrary to the feelings of the human heart, it was answered, that it was admitted to be contrary to the feelings of pride and ambition; but those were feelings which ought not to be gratified at the expence of freedom. It was urged, that the position that great States would have great objects in view, in which they would not suffer the less States to thwart them, was one of the strongest reasons why inequality of representation ought not to be admitted—If those great objects were not inconsistent with the interest of the less States, they would readily concur in them, but if they were inconsistent with the interest of a majority of the States composing the government, in that case two or three States ought not to have it in their power to aggrandize themselves at the expence of all the [145]rest—To those who alledged that equality of suffrage in our federal government, was the poisonous source from which all our misfortunes flowed, it was answered, that the allegation was not founded in fact—That equality of suffrage had never been complained of by the States as a defect in our federal system—That among the eminent writers, foreigners and others, who had treated of the defects of our confederation, and proposed alterations, none had proposed an alteration in this part of the system: And members of the convention both in and out of Congress, who advocated the equality of suffrage, called upon their opponents both in and out of Congress, and challenged them to produce one single instance where a bad measure had been adopted, or a good measure had failed of adoption in consequence of the States having an equal vote; on the contrary, they urged, that all our evils flowed from the want of power in the federal head, and that let the right of suffrage in the States be altered in any manner whatever, if no greater powers were given to the government, the same inconveniences would continue. It was denied that the equality of suffrage was originally agreed to on principles of necessity or expediency, on the contrary, that it was adopted on the principles of the rights of men and the rights of States which were then well known, and which then influenced our conduct although now they seem to be forgotten—For this the journals of Congress were appealed to; it was from them shewn, that when the committee of Congress reported to that body the articles of confederation, the very first article which became the subject of discussion, was that respecting the equality of suffrage—That Virginia proposed divers modes of suffrage, all on the principle of inequality, which were almost unanimously rejected2—That on the question for adopting the article, it passed, Virginia being the only State which voted in the negative—That after the articles of confederation were submitted to the States by them to be ratified, almost every State proposed certain amendments, which they instructed their delegates to endeavour to obtain before ratification,3 and that among all the amendments proposed, not one State, not even Virginia, proposed an amendment of that article, securing the equality of suffrage—the most convincing proof it was agreed to and adopted, not from necessity, but upon a full conviction, that according to the principles of free governments, the States had a right to that equality of suffrage. But, Sir, it was to no purpose that the futility of their objections were shewn—when driven from the pretence that the equality of suffrage had been originally agreed to on principles of expediency and necessity, the representatives of the large States persisted in a declaration, that they would never agree to admit the smaller States to an equality of suffrage—In answer to this, they were informed, and informed in terms the most [146]strong and energetic that could possibly be used, that we never would agree to a system giving them the undue influence and superiority they proposed—That we would risque every possible consequence—That from anarchy and confusion order might arise—That slavery was the worst that could ensue, and we considered the system proposed to be the most complete, most abject system of slavery that the wit of man ever devised, under the pretence of forming a government for free States—That we never would submit tamely and servilely to a present certain evil in dread of a future, which might be imaginary—That we were sensible the eyes of our country and of the world were upon us—That we would not labour under the imputation of being unwilling to form a strong and energetic federal government; but we would publish the system which we approved, and also that which we opposed, and leave it to our country and the world at large to judge between us, who best understood the rights of free men and free States, and who best advocated them—and to the same tribunal we would submit who ought to be answerable for all the consequences which might arise to the union from the convention breaking up without proposing any system to their constituents.—During this debate we were threatened, that if we did not agree to the system proposed, we never should have an opportunity of meeting in convention to deliberate on another, and this was frequently urged—In answer, we called upon them to shew what was to prevent it, and from what quarter was our danger to proceed—was it from a foreign enemy? Our distance from Europe, and the political situation of that country, left us but little to fear—Was there any ambitious State or States, who in violation of every sacred obligation was preparing to inslave the other States, and raise itself to consequence on the ruin of the others? Or was there any such ambitious individual? We did not apprehend it to be the case—But suppose it to be true, it rendered it the more necessary that we should sacredly guard against a system which might enable all those ambitious views to be carried into effect, even under the sanction of the constitution and government—in fine, Sir, all these threats were treated with contempt, and they were told that we apprehended but one reason to prevent the States meeting again in convention—that when they discovered the part this convention had acted, and how much its members were abusing the trust reposed in them, the States would never trust another convention.—At length, Sir, after every argument had been exhausted by the advocates of equality of representation, the question was called, when a majority decided in favour of the inequality—Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia voting for it—Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware against it—Maryland divided.4—It may be thought surprising, Sir, that Georgia, a State now small and comparatively trifling in [147]the union, should advocate this system of unequal representation, giving up her present equality in the federal government, and sinking herself almost to total insignificance in the scale; but, Sir, it must be considered that Georgia has the most extensive territory in the union, being larger than the whole island of Great-Britain, and thirty times as large as Connecticut. This system being designed to preserve to the States their whole territory unbroken, and to prevent the erection of new States within the territory of any of them—Georgia looked forward when her population, being increased in some measure proportioned to her territory, she should rise in the scale and give law to the other States, and hence we found the delegation of Georgia warmly advocating the proposition of giving the States unequal representation. Next day the question came on with respect to the inequality of representation in the second branch, but little debate took place; the subject had been exhausted on the former question. On the votes being taken, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina and South-Carolina voted for the inequality. Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland(a) were in the negative. Georgia had only two representatives on the floor, one of whom (not I believe because he was against the measure, but from a conviction that we would go home, and thereby dissolve the convention before we would give up the question) voted also in the negative, by which that State was divided.5 Thus, Sir, on this great and important part of the system, the convention being equally divided, five States for the measure, five against, and one divided, there was a total stand, and we did not seem very likely to proceed any further. At length it was proposed, that a select committee should be ballotted for, composed of a member from each State, which committee should endeavour to devise some mode of conciliation or compromise; I had the honor to be on that committee; we met and discussed the subject of difference; the one side insisted on the inequality of suffrage in both branches, the other insisted on the equality in both; each party was tenacious of their sentiments, when it was found that nothing could induce us to yield the inequality in both branches; they at length proposed by way of compromise, if we would accede to their wishes as to the first branch, they would agree to the equal representation in the second branch. To this it was answered, that there was no merit in the proposal; it was only consenting, after they had struggled, to put both their feet on our necks, to take one of them off, provided we would consent to let them keep the other on, when they knew at the same time, that they could not put one foot on our necks, unless we would consent to it, and that by being permitted to keep on that one foot, they should afterwards be able to place the other foot on whenever they pleased. They were also called on to inform us what security they could give us should we agree to this compromise, that they would abide by the plan of government formed upon it, any longer than it suited their interest, or they found it expedient.—“The States have a right to an equality of representation. This is secured to us by our present articles of confederation, we are in possession of this privilege—It is now to be torn from us.—What security can you give us, that, when you get the power the proposed system will give you, when you have men and money, that you will not force from the States that equality of suffrage in the second branch, which you now deny to be their right, and only give up from absolute necessity? Will you tell us we ought to trust you because you now enter into a solemn compact with us? This you have done before, and now treat it with the utmost contempt.—Will you now make an appeal to the Supreme Being, and call on him to guarantee your observance of the compact? The same you have formerly done for your observance of the articles of confederation, which you are now violating in the most wanton manner! [“]The same reasons which you now urge for destroying our present federal government, may be urged for abolishing the system which you now propose to adopt; and as the method prescribed by the articles of confederation is now totally disregarded by you, as little regard may be shewn by you to the rules prescribed for the amendment of the new system,6 whenever having obtained power by the government, you shall hereafter be pleased either to discard it entirely, or so to alter it as to give yourselves all that superiority which you have now contended for, and to obtain which you have shewn yourselves disposed to hazard the union.”—Such, Sir, was the language used on that occasion, and they were told that as we could not possibly have a greater tie on them for their observance of the new system than we had for their observance of the articles of confederation, which had proved totally insufficient, it would be wrong and imprudent to confide in them.—It was further observed, that the inequality of the representation would be daily increasing—That many of the States whose territory was confined and whose population was at this time large in proportion to their territory would probably twenty, thirty, or forty years hence, have no more representatives than at the introduction of the government, whereas the States having extensive territory, where lands are to be procured cheap, would be daily encreasing in the number of their inhabitants not only from propagation but from the emigration of the inhabitants of the other States, and would have soon double, or perhaps treble the number of representatives that they are to have at first, and thereby enormously encrease their influence in the national councils. However, the majority of the select committee at length agreed to a series of propositions by way of compromise, part [149]of which related to the representation in the first branch nearly as the system is now published: And part of them to the second branch securing in that equal representation, and reported them as a compromise upon the express terms that they were wholly to be adopted or wholly to be rejected; upon this compromise, a great number of the members so far engaged themselves, that if the system was progressed upon agreeable to the terms of the compromise, they would lend it their names, by signing it, and would not actively oppose it, if their States should appear inclined to adopt it—Some, however, in which number was myself, who joined in the report and agreed to proceed upon those principles and see what kind of a system would ultimately be formed upon it, yet reserved to themselves in the most explicit manner the right of finally giving a solemn dissent to the system, if it was thought by them inconsistent with the freedom and happiness of their country—This, Sir, will account why the members of the convention so generally signed their names to the system; not because they thought it a proper one—not because they thoroughly approved, or were unanimous for it; but because they thought it better than the system attempted to be forced upon them—This, report of the select committee was after long dissension adopted by a majority of the convention, and the system was proceeded in accordingly—I believe near a fortnight, perhaps more, was spent in the discussion of this business,7 during which, we were on the verge of dissolution, scarce held together by the strength of an hair, though the public papers were announcing our extreme unanimity.8 Mr. Speaker, I think it my duty to observe, that during this struggle to prevent the large States from having all power in their hands, which had nearly terminated in a dissolution of the convention, it did not appear to me that either of those illustrious characters the Honorable Mr. Washington, or the President of the State of Pennsylvania,9 were disposed to favour the claims of the smaller States against the undue superiority attempted by the large States; on the contrary, the Honourable President of Pennsylvania was a member of the committee of compromise, and there advocated the right of the large States to an inequality in both branches and only ultimately conceded it in the second branch on the principle of conciliation, when it was found that no other terms would be accepted—This, Sir, I think it my duty to mention, for the consideration of those who endeavour to prop up a dangerous and defective system by great names; soon after this period, the Honourable Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing of New-York left us—They had uniformly opposed the system, and I believe, despairing of getting a proper one brought forward, or of rendering any real service, they returned no more10—The propositions reported by the committee of the whole house, having been fully discussed by the [150]convention, and with many alterations having been agreed to by a majority, a committee of five, were appointed to detail the system according to the principles contained in what had been agreed to by that majority—This was likely to require some time, and the convention adjourned for eight or ten days.11—Before the adjournment, I moved for liberty to be given to the different members to take correct copies of the propositions, to which the convention had then agreed, in order that during the recess of the convention, we might have an opportunity of considering them, and if it should be thought that any alterations or amendments were necessary, that we might be prepaired against the convention met to bring them forward for discussion. But, Sir, the same spirit which caused our doors to be shut—our proceedings to be kept secret—our journals to be locked up—and every avenue, as far as possible, to be shut to public information, prevailed also in this case, and the proposal so reasonable and necessary was rejected by a majority of the convention, thereby precluding even the members themselves, from the necessary means of information and deliberation on the important business in which they were engaged.12 (To be continued.) (a) On this question, Mr. Martin was the only delegate for Maryland present, which circumstance secured the State a negative. Immediately after the question had been taken, and the president had declared the votes, Mr. Jenifer came into the Convention, when Mr. King, from Massachusetts, valuing himself on Mr. Jenifer to divide the State of Maryland on this question, as he had on the former, requested of the president that the question might be put again—however the motion was too extraordinary in its nature to meet with success!"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/8/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It has been observed, Mr. Speaker, by my honorable colleagues, that the debate respecting the mode of representation, was productive of considerable warmth; this observation is true; but, Sir, it is equally true, that if we could have tamely and servilely consented to be bound in chains, and meanly condescended to assist in rivetting them fast, we might have avoided all that warmth, and have proceeded with as much calmness [157]and coolness as any stoick could have wished.—Having thus, Sir, given the honorable members of this house, a short history of some interesting parts of our proceedings, I shall beg leave to take up the system published by the convention, and shall request your indulgence, while I make some observations on different parts of it, and give you such further information as may be in my power. (Here Mr. Martin read the first section of the first article, and then proceeded.) With respect to this part of the system, Mr. Speaker, there was a diversity of sentiment; those who were for two branches in the legislature, a house of representatives and a senate, urged the necessity of a second branch to serve as a check upon the first, and used all those trite and common place arguments which are proper and just, when applied to the formation of a State government over individuals variously distinguished in their habits and manners, fortune and rank; where a body chosen in a select manner, respectable for their wealth and dignity, may be necessary, frequently to prevent the hasty and rash measures of a representation more popular; but on the other side it was urged, that none of these arguments could with propriety be applied to the formation of a federal government over a number of independent States—That it is the State governments which are to watch over and protect the rights of the individual, whether rich or poor, or of moderate circumstances, and in which the democratic and aristocratic influence or principles are to be so blended, modified, and checked as to prevent oppression and injury—That the federal government is to guard and protect the States and their rights, and to regulate their common concerns—That a federal government is formed by the States, as States that is in their sovereign capacities, in the same manner as treaties and alliances are formed—That sovereignties considered as such, cannot be said to have jarring interests or principles, the one aristocratic, and the other democratic; but that the principles of a sovereignty considered as a sovereignty, are the same, whether that sovereignty is monarchical, aristocratical, democratical, or mixed—That the history of mankind doth not furnish an instance from its earliest period to the present time, of a federal government constituted of two distinct branches—That the members of the federal government, if appointed by the States in their State capacities, that is by their legislatures, as they ought, would be select in their choice, and coming from different States, having different interests and views; this difference of interests and views, would always be a sufficient check over the whole; and it was shewn, that even Adams, who, the reviewers have justly observed, appears to be as fond of checks and balances as Lord Chesterfield of the graces, even he declares that a council consisting of one branch has always been found sufficient in a federal government.2 It was urged, that the government we were forming was not in reality a federal but a national government, not founded on the principles of the preservation, but the abolition or consolidation of all State governments—That we appeared totally to have forgot the business for which we were sent, and the situation of the country for which we were preparing our system—That we had not been sent to form a government over the inhabitants of America, considered as individuals, that as individuals they were all subject to their respective State governments, which governments would still remain, though the federal government was dissolved—That the system of government we were entrusted to prepare, was a government over these thirteen States; but that in our proceedings, we adopted principles which would be right and proper, only on the supposition that there were no State governments at all, but that all the inhabitants of this extensive continent were in their individual capacity, without government and in a state of nature—That accordingly the system proposes the legislature to consist of two branches, the one to be drawn from the people at large, immediately in their individual capacity—the other to be chose in a more select manner, as a check upon the first—It is in its very introduction declared to be a compact between the people of the United States as individuals—and it is to be ratified by the people at large in their capacity as individuals; all which it was said, would be quite right and proper, if there were no State governments, if all the people of this continent were in a state of nature, and we were forming one national government for them as individuals, and is nearly the same as was done in most of the States, when they formed their governments over the people who compose them. Whereas it was urged, that the principles on which a federal government over States ought to be constructed and ratified are the reverse—that instead of the legislature consisting of two branches, one branch was sufficient, whether examined by the dictates of reason or the experience of ages—That the representation instead of being drawn from the people at large, as individuals, ought to be drawn from the States as States in their sovereign capacity—That in a federal government, the parties to the compact are not the people as individuals, but the States as States, and that it is by the States as States in their sovereign capacity, that the system of government ought to be ratified, and not by the people as individuals. It was further said, that in a federal government over States equally free, sovereign and independent, every State ought to have an equal share in making the federal laws or regulations—in deciding upon them, and in carrying them into execution, neither of which was the case in this system, but the reverse, the States not having an equal voice in the legislature, nor in the appointment of the executive, the judges, and the other [159]officers of government—It was insisted, that in the whole system there was but one federal feature—the appointment of the senators by the States in their sovereign capacity, that is by their legislatures, and the equality of suffrage in that branch; but it was said that this feature was only federal in appearance. To prove this, and that the Senate as constituted could not be a security for the protection and preservation of the State governments, and that the senators could not be justly considered the representatives of the States as States, it was observed, that upon just principles of representation, the representative ought to speak the sentiments of his constituents, and ought to vote in the same manner that his constituents would do (as far as he can judge) provided his constituents were acting in person, and had the same knowledge and information with himself; and therefore that the representative ought to be dependant on his constituents, and answerable to them—that the connection between the representative and the represented, ought to be as near and as close as possible; according to these principles, Mr. Speaker, in this State it is provided by its constitution, that the representatives in Congress, shall be chosen annually, shall be paid by the State, and shall be subject to recall even within the year;3 so cautiously has our constitution guarded against an abuse of the trust reposed in our representatives in the federal government; whereas by the third and sixth sections of the first article of this new system, the senators are to be chosen for six years instead of being chosen annually; instead of being paid by their States who send them, they in conjunction with the other branch, are to pay themselves out of the treasury of the United States; and are not liable to be recalled during the period for which they are chosen—Thus, Sir, for six years the senators are rendered totally and absolutely independent of their States, of whom they ought to be the representatives, without any bond or tie between them—During that time they may join in measures ruinous and destructive to their States, even such as should totally annihilate their State governments, and their States cannot recall them, nor exercise any controul over them. Another consideration, Mr. Speaker, it was thought ought to have great weight to prove that the smaller States cannot depend on the senate for the preservation of their rights, either against large and ambitious States, or against an ambitious, aspiring President.—The senate, Sir, is so constituted, that they are not only to compose one branch of the legislature, but by the second section of the second article, ⟨they are to compose a privy council for the President; hence it will he necessary, that they should be, in a great measure, a permanent body, constantly residing at the seat of government.⟩4 Seven[ty] years is estimated for the life of a man; it can hardly be supposed, that a senator, especially from the States remote from the [160]seat of empire, will accept of an appointment which must estrange him for six years from his State, without giving up to a great degree his prospects in his own State. If he has a family, he will take his family with him to the place where the government shall be fixed, that will become his home, and there is every reason to expect that his future views and prospects will centre in the favours and emoluments either of the general government, or of the government of that State where the seat of empire is established:—In either case, he is lost to his own State. If he places his future prospects in the favours and emoluments of the general government, he will become the dependant and creature of the President, as the system enables a senator to be appointed to offices, and without the nomination of the President, no appointment can take place; as such, he will favour the wishes of the President, and concur in his measures, who, if he has no ambitious views of his own to gratify, may be too favourable to the ambitious views of the large States, who will have an undue share in his original appointment, and on whom he will be more dependant afterwards than on the States which are smaller. If the senator places his future prospects in that State where the seat of empire is fixed; from that time he will be in every question wherein its particular interest may be concerned the representative of that State, not of his own. But even this provision apparently for the security of the State governments, inadequate as it is, is entirely left at the mercy of the general government, for by the fourth section of the first article, it is expressly provided, that the Congress shall have a power to make and alter all regulations concerning the time and manner of holding elections for senators; a provision, expressly looking forward to, and I have no doubt designed for the utter extinction and abolition of all State governments; nor will this, I believe, be doubted by any person, when I inform you that some of the warm advocates and patrons of the system in convention, strenuously opposed the choice of the senators by the State legislatures, insisting that the State governments ought not to be introduced in any manner so as to be component parts of, or instruments for carrying into execution, the general government—Nay, so far were the friends of the system from pretending that they meant it or considered it as a federal system, that on the question being proposed, “that a union of the States, merely federal, ought to be the sole object of the exercise of the powers vested in the convention;” it was negatived by a majority of the members, and it was resolved, “that a national government ought to be formed”5—afterwards the word “national” was struck out by them, because they thought the word might tend to alarm6—and although now, they who advocate the system, pretend to call themselves federalists, in convention the distinction was just the reverse; those who opposed the system, were there considered and stiled the federal party, those who advocated it, the antifederal. Viewing it as a national, not a federal government, as calculated and designed not to protect and preserve, but to abolish and annihilate the State governments, it was opposed for the following reasons—It was said that this continent was much too extensive for one national government, which should have sufficient power and energy to pervade and hold in obedience and subjection all its parts, consistent with the enjoyment and preservation of liberty—That the genius and habits of the people of America, were opposed to such a government—That during their connection with Great-Britain, they had been accustomed to have all their concerns transacted within a narrow circle, their colonial districts—they had been accustomed to have their seats of government near them, to which they might have access, without much inconvenience when their business should require it. That at this time we find if a county is rather large, the people complain of the inconvenience, and clamour for a division of their county, or for a removal of the place where their courts are held, so as to render it more central and convenient—That in those States, the territory of which is extensive, as soon as the population encreases remote from the seat of government, the inhabitants are urgent for a removal of the seat of their government, or to be erected into a new State—As a proof of this, the inhabitants of the western parts of Virginia and North-Carolina, of Vermont and the province of Main, were instances, even the inhabitants of the western parts of Pennsylvania, who it was said already seriously look forward to the time when they shall either be erected into a new State, or have their seat of government removed to the Susquehannah.7—If the inhabitants of the different States consider it as a grievance to attend a county-court or the seat of their own government, when a little inconvenient, can it be supposed they would ever submit to have a national government established, the seat of which would be more than a thousand miles removed from some of them?—It was insisted that governments of a republican nature, are those best calculated to preserve the freedom and happiness of the citizen—That governments of this kind, are only calculated for a territory but small in its extent—That the only method by which an extensive continent like America could be connected and united together consistent with the principles of freedom, must be by having a number of strong and energetic State governments for securing and protecting the rights of the individuals forming those governments, and for regulating all their concerns; and a strong energetic federal government over those States for the protection and preservation, and for regulating the common concerns of the States.—It was further insisted, that even if it was possible to effect a total abolition of the State governments at this time, and to establish one general government over the people of America, it could not long [162]subsist, but in a little time would again be broken into a variety of governments of a smaller extent, similar in some manner to the present situation of this continent; the principal difference in all probability would be that the governments, so established, being effected by some violent convulsion, might not be formed on principles so favourable to liberty as those of our present State governments—That this ought to be an important consideration to such of the States who had excellent governments, which was the case with Maryland and most others, whatever it might be to persons who disapproving of their particular State government would be willing to hazard every thing to overturn and destroy it.—These reasons, Sir, influenced me to vote against two branches in the legislature, and against every part of the system which was repugnant to the principles of a federal government—Nor was there a single argument urged, or reason assigned, which to my mind was satisfactory, to prove that a good government on federal principles was unattainable, the whole of their arguments only proving, what none of us controverted, that our federal government as originally formed was defective and wanted amendment—However, a majority of the convention hastily and inconsiderately, without condescending to make a fair trial, in their great wisdom, decided that a kind of government which a Montesquieu and a Price have declared the best calculated of any to preserve internal liberty, and to enjoy external strength and security, and the only one by which a large continent can be connected and united consistent with the principles of liberty was totally impracticable, and they acted accordingly.8 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/8/1788,"To the PEOPLE. My last Address1 contained the outlines of a system fully adequate to all the useful purposes of the union. Its object is to raise a sufficient revenue from the foreign trade, and the sale of our publick lands, to satisfy all the publick exegencies, and to encourage, at the same time, our internal industry and manufactures. It also secures each state in its own separate rights, while the continental concerns are thrown into the general department. The only deficiencies that I have been able to discover in the plan, and in the view of federalists they are very great ones, are, that it does not allow the interference of Congress in the domestick concerns of the state and that it does not render our national councils so liable to foreign influence. The first of these articles tends to guard us from that infinite multiplication of officers which the report of the Convention of Philadelphia proposes. With regard to the second, it is evidently not of much importance to any foreign nation to purchase, at a very high price, a majority of votes in an assembly, whose members are continually exposed to a recall. But give those members a right to sit six, or even two, years, with such extensive powers as the new system proposes, and their friendship will be well worth a purchase. This is the only sense in which the Philadelphia system will render us more respectable in the eyes of foreigners. In every other view they lose their respect for us, as it will render us more like their own degraded models. It is a maxim with them, that every man has his price. If therefore we were to judge of what passes in the hearts of the federalists when they urge us, as they continually do, to be like other nations, and when they assign mercenary motives to the opposers of their plan, we should conclude very fairly, that themselves wish to be provided for at the publick expense. However that may be if we look upon the men, we shall find some of their leaders to have formed pretty strong attachments to foreign nations. Whether those attachments arose from their being educated under a royal government, from a former unfortunate mistake in politicks, or from the agencies for foreigners, or any other cause, is not in my province to determine. But certain it is, that some of the principal fomenters of this plan have never shewn themselves capable of that generous system of policy which is founded in the affections of freemen. Power and high life are their idols, and national funds are necessary to support them. Some of the principal powers of Europe have already entered into treaties with us, and that some of the rest have not done it, is not owing, as is falsely pretended, to the want of power in Congress. Holland never found any difficulty of this kind from the multitude of sovereignties in that country, which must all be consulted on such an occasion. The resentment of Great Britain for our victories in the late war has induced that power to restrain our intercourse with their subjects. Probably an hope, the only solace of the wretched, that their affairs would take a more favourable turn on this continent, has had some influence on their proceedings. All their restrictions have answered the end of securing our independence by driving us into many valuable manufactures. Their own colonies in the mean time have languished for want of an intercourse with these states. The new settlement in Nova-Scotia has miserably decayed, and the West-India islands have suffered for want of our supplies, and by the loss of our market. This has affected the revenue; and however contemptuously some men may affect to speak of our trade, the supply of six millions of people is an object worth the attention of any nation upon earth. Interest in such a nation as Britain will surmount their resentment. However their pride may be stung, they will pursue after wealth. Increase of revenue to a nation over whelmed with a debt of near two hundred and ninety millions sterling is an object to which little piques must give way; and there is no doubt that their interest consists in securing as much of our trade as they can. These are topicks from which are drawn some of the most plausible reasons that have been given by the federalists in favour of their plan, as derived from the sentiments of foreigners. We have weighed them and found them wanting. That they had not themselves full confidence in their own reasons at Philadelphia is evident from the method they took to bias the state Convention. Mess’rs Wilson and M’Kean, two Scottish names, were repeatedly worsted in the argument. To make amends for their own incapacity, the gallery was filled with a rabble, who shouted their applause, and these heroes of aristocracy were not ashamed, though modesty is their national virtue, to vindicate such a violation of decency2 Means not less criminal, but not so flagrantly indecent, have been frequently mentioned among us to secure a majority?’. But those who vote for a price, can never sanctify wrong, and treason will still retain its deformity."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/9/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, In the preceding numbers it has been shewn, that the original design of calling the federal convention has not been carried into effect—That they nevertheless reported a system of government with a professed intention of consolidating the union—That they had not the least publick authority to discuss, much less to decide this great question—That neither Congress or the Legislatures have been disposed to express any opinion on the new system—That although they were constitutionally restrained from deciding, yet they had a right at any time, to have agitated and considered the question, to have explained it to the people, and to have recommended their electing State Conventions to have taken up the matter—That had this been done, the people would have had every necessary information, and probably have united in some salutary measure—That they are now without that information, and by the mode of conducting this matter, are thrown into great confusion—That a party spirit prevails, and is daily increasing—That in the present temper of the people, it will not restore peace or tranquility to reject the system, or to ratify it with or without the delusive prospect of future alterations—That if accepted in its present form, there is not a probability of supporting it—and that amendments are indispensibly necessary, in order to its adoption.—These are facts which if any one doubts, will I think, clearly appear when we consider the system itself. The revolution which separated the United States from Great-Britain, was not more important to the liberties of America, than that which will result from the adoption of the new system. The former freed us from a foreign subjugation, and there is too much reason to apprehend, that the latter will reduce us to a federal domination. Had the Convention thought proper, merely to have formed the plan, and to have sent it to Congress, and the legislatures, the consequences would not have been so serious, as from their accompanying it with the following resolutions.—“Resolved,1 That the preceeding Constitution be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, and that it is the opinion of this Convention, that it should afterwards be submitted to a Convention of Delegates chosen in each state by the PEOPLE thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification, and that [662]each Convention, assenting to and ratifying the same, should give notice thereof to the United States in Congress assembled.” “Resolved, That it is the opinion of the Convention, that as soon as the Conventions of nine States shall have ratified the Constitution, the United Suites in Congress assembled shall fix a day on which electors should be appointed by the States which shall have ratified the same, and a day on which the electors should assemble to vote for the President, and the time and place for commencing proceedings under this Constitution: That after such publication, the electors should be appointed, and the Senators and Representatives elected: That the electors should meet on the day fixed for the election of the President; and should transmit their votes, certified, signed, sealed and directed, as the Constitution requires, to the secretary of the United States in Congress assembled, that the Senators and Representatives should convene at the time and place assigned—That the Senators should appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole purpose of receiving, opening and counting the votes for President, and that after he shall be chosen, the congress together with the President, should without delay, proceed to execute this Constitution.” In consequence of these resolutions of the federal convention, Congress “Resolved, That the Constitution so reported be transmitted to the several legislatures, in order to be submitted to a Convention of Delegates, chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the said Convention in that case made and provided”—and in pursuance thereof, the legislature of this State resolved, “That it be, and it is hereby recommended to the people of this Commonwealth, that a Convention of Delegates be chosen agreeably to and for the purposes mentioned in the resolution of Congress aforesaid.[”]—It is evident, therefore, that the proposed Constitution is, agreeably to the recommendation of the federal Convention, submitted to the State Convention, that is, to a majority of its members, for their assent and ratification. Should the plan be adopted by this and eight other States, every part of the Constitution of this Commonwealth which is contrary to the new Constitution, to the laws that may he made in pursuance thereof or to treaties of the United States, will be null and void: for the plan expressly provides, that “this Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any state to contrary notwithstanding—And will not such a subjection of the Constitution of this Commonwealth, not only to the Constitution, but to the law of the union, and to treaties, that are or may be made under the [663]authority of Congress, be in effect, a DISSOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS? Surely it will. Mr. Locke, in his treatise of civil government, chap. 19, in sect. 212,2 says, “Governments are dissolved from within, when the legislative is altered,” and in sect. 215, “for it is not a certain number of men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have also freedom of debating, and leisure of perfecting, what is for the good of the society, wherein the legislative consists: when these are taken away, or altered, so as to deprive the society of the due exercise of this power, the legislative is truly altered; for it is not names that constitute governments, but the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany them.3 What were the powers originally intended by the people of this State, to be used and exercised by their legislature, they are contained in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, part 2, chap. 1, sect. 1, under the head of “the legislative power,”4 qualified nevertheless by certain reservations in the Bill of Rights.5 Some of the most important of those powers will, by the new plan, be transferred to the federal government, and others be exercised by their permission. This, I presume, is too evident to be denied, and will hereafter more fully appear. Our government will then have the name that it now has, but not “the use and exercise of those powers that were intended to accompany it.” Indeed, it is inconceivable, that a plan of consolidation can be established, without destroying the sovereignty of the respective States, and thus dissolving their present governments. But supposing the adoption of the new plan would only alter the Constitution of this State, by what mode should that alteration be made? Should it be effected pursuant to the recommendation of a federal Convention, and in direct violation of the Constitution of this State? or should the alteration be made consistently with the Constitution. itself? This expressly provides, “That, in order the more effectually to adhere to the principles of the Constitution, and to correct those violations which by any means may be made therein, as well as to form such alterations as from experience shall be found necessary, the General Court, which shall be in the year of our Lord 1795, shall issue precepts to the selectmen of the several towns, and to the assessors of the unincorporated plantations, directing them to convene the qualified voters of their respective towns and plantations for the purpose of collecting their sentiments on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution, in order to amendments: And if it. shall appear by the returns made, that two thirds of The qualified voters throughout the State, who shall assemble and vote in consequence of the said precepts, are in favour of such revision or amendment, the General Court shall issue precepts, or direct them to be issued, from the secretary’s office to the [664]several towns to elect delegates to meet in Convention, for the purpose aforesaid: The said delegates to be chosen in the same manner and proportion as their representatives,”6 &c.—Here we see, that, by the Constitution of this State in the year 1795, the sentiments of the qualified voters on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution, are to be collected, and if it shall then appear that two thirds of them are in favour of a revision and amendment, in that case only, is a Convention to be called for these purposes. Should it be a question, whether an alteration in the Constitution can be made before the year 1795, there is nothing in the clause recited, that I can conceive to prevent it: because although in the year 1795, precepts must issue for the purposes mentioned, there is no provision to prevent their issuing, if necessary, before that period. But surely, if any alteration should be made in the Constitution, it must be in a mode provided by the Constitution itself for otherwise the clause recited must become a nullity, which is inadmissible, or, which is the same thing, the Constitution itself must be violated. Of all compacts, a Constitution or frame of Government, is the most solemn and important, and should be strictly adhered to. The object of it is the preservation of that property, which every individual of the community has, in his life, liberty and estate:7 Every measure therefore, that only approaches to an infraction of such a covenant, ought to be avoided, because it will injure that sacred regard to the Constitution which should be deeply impressed on the minds of the whole community—How much more careful then should we be to avoid an open violation of such a compact! Such a violation must take place, if a majority, or every member of the Convention, should vote for an acceptance of the new Constitution, because a Convention cannot be called for altering, much less dissolving the government Massachusetts, before the sentiments of the qualified voters are collected on the necessity or expediency of revising the Constitution in order to amendment, and two thirds of them shall be in favour of the measure. A ratification, therefore of the new Constitution by the State Convention, cannot be binding on the citizens of this State, being directly repugnant to an existing covenant. But suppose such a ratification should be supported by a majority of the Convention and of the citizens of this State: What must be the consequence of thus destroying all publick faith and confidence? Are not these the principles that bind and cement the community, and that establish them as a body politick? Are they not the foundation of a free Government? If every individual by such a measure, should have his nth and confidence in the honour and integrity of the community effectually destroyed, (and this must inevitably be the consequence) will he not decline entering into such a nugatory compact in future, [665]or entering into it, will he not disregard it as a mere matter of form, and rather than he at any pains or expense to support it, suffer it to share the fate of the other? Certainly he will, and instead of a government founded in compact, we must hereafter be content with one founded in fraud or force."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/11/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. With respect to that part of the second section of the first article, which relates to the apportionment of representation and direct taxation, there were considerable objections made to it, besides the great objection of inequality—It was urged, that no principle could justify taking slaves into computation in apportioning the number of representatives a State should have in the government—that it involved the absurdity of increasing the power of a State in making laws for free men in proportion as that State [170]violated the rights of freedom—That it might be proper to take slaves into consideration, when taxes were to be apportioned, because it had a tendency to discourage slavery; but to take them into account in giving representation tended to encourage the slave trade, and to make it the interest of the States to continue that infamous traffic—That slaves could not be taken into account as men, or citizens, because they were not admitted to the rights of citizens in the States which adopted or continued slavery—If they were to be taken into account as property, it was asked, what peculiar circumstance should render this property (of all others the most odious in its nature) entitled to the high privilege of conferring consequence and power in the government to its possessors, rather than any other property—and why slaves should, as property, be taken into account rather than horses, cattle, mules, or any other species—and it was observed by an honorable member from Massachusetts, that he considered it as dishonorable and humiliating to enter into compact with the slaves of the southern States, as it would be with the horses and mules of the eastern.2 It was also objected, that the numbers of representatives appointed by this section to be sent by the particular States to compose the first legislature, were not precisely agreeable to the rule of representation adopted by this system, and that the numbers in this section are artfully lessened for the large States, while the smaller States have their full proportion in order to prevent the undue influence which the large States will have in the government from being too apparent; and I think, Mr. Speaker, that this objection is well founded.—I have taken some pains to obtain information of the numbers of free men and slaves in the different States, and I have reason to believe, that if the estimate was now taken, which is directed, and one delegate to be sent for every thirty thousand inhabitants, that Virginia would have at least twelve delegates, Massachusetts eleven, and Pennsylvania ten, instead of the numbers stated in this section; whereas the other States, I believe, would not have more than the numbers there allowed them, nor would Georgia, most probably at present, send more than two—If I am right, Mr. Speaker, upon the enumeration being made, and the representation being apportioned according to the rule prescribed, the whole number of delegates would be seventy-one, thirty-six of which would be a quorum to do business; the delegates of Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, would amount to thirty-three of that quorum—Those three States will, therefore, have much more than equal power and influence in making the laws and regulations, which are to affect this continent, and will have a moral certainty of preventing any laws or regulations which they disapprove, although they might be thought ever so necessary by a great majority of the States—It was further objected, that even if the States [171]who had most inhabitants ought to have a greater number of delegates, yet the number of delegates ought not to be in exact proportion to the number of inhabitants, because the influence and power of those States whose delegates are numerous, will be greater when compared to the influence and power of the other States, than the proportion which the numbers of their delegates bear to each other; as for instance, though Delaware has one delegate, and Virginia but ten, yet Virginia has more than ten times as much power and influence in the government as Delaware; to prove this, it was observed, that Virginia would have a much greater chance to carry any measure than any number of States, whose delegates were altogether ten (suppose the States of Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode-Island, and New-Hampshire) since the ten delegates from Virginia in every thing that related to the interest of that State would act in union and move one solid and compact body, whereas the delegates of these four States, though collectively equal in number to those from Virginia, coming from different States, having different interests, will be less likely to harmonize and move in concert—As a further proof it was said, that Virginia, as the system is now reported, by uniting with her the delegates of four other States, can carry a question against the sense and interest of eight States by sixty-four different combinations, the four States voting with Virginia, being every time so far different as not to be composed of the same four; whereas the State of Delaware can only, by uniting four other States with her, carry a measure against the sense of eight States by two different combinations—a mathematical proof that the State of Virginia has thirty-two times greater chance of carrying a measure against the sense of eight States than Delaware, although Virginia has only ten times as many delegates—It was also shewn, that the idea was totally fallacious which was attempted to be maintained, that if a State had one thirteenth part of the numbers composing the delegation in this system, such State would have as much influence as under the articles of confederation; to prove the fallacy of this idea it was shewn, that under the articles of confederation the State of Maryland had but one vote in thirteen, yet no measure could be carried against her interests without seven States, a majority of the whole concurring in it; whereas in this system, though Maryland has six votes, which is more than the proportion of one in thirteen, yet five States may, in a variety of combinations, carry a question against her interest, though seven other States concur with her, and six States by a much greater number of combinations, may carry a measure against Maryland, united with six other States. I shall here, Sir, just observe, that as the committee of detail reported the system, the delegates from the different States were to be one for every forty thousand inhabitants; it was afterwards altered to one for every thirty [172]thousand; this alteration was made after I left the convention, at the instance of whom I know not,3 but it is evident that the alteration is in favour of the States which have large and extensive territory to increase their power and influence in the government, and to the injury of the smaller States—Since it is the States of extensive territory, who will most speedily increase the number of their inhabitants as before has been observed, and will, therefore, most speedily procure an increase to the number of their delegates—By this alteration Virginia, North-Carolina, or Georgia, by obtaining one hundred and twenty thousand additional inhabitants, will be entitled to four additional delegates, whereas such State would only have been entitled to three, if forty thousand had remained the number by which to apportion the delegation. As to that part of this section that relates to direct taxation, there was also an objection for the following reasons—It was said that as a large sum of money was to be brought into the national treasury by the duties on commerce, which would be almost wholly paid by the commercial States, it would be unequal and unjust that the sum which was necessary to be raised by direct taxation should be apportioned equally upon all the States, obliging the commercial States to pay as large a share of the revenue arising therefrom, as the States from whom no revenue had been drawn by imposts—Since the wealth and industry of the inhabitants of the commercial States will in the first place be severely taxed through their commerce, and afterwards be equally taxed with the industry and wealth of the inhabitants of the other States, who have paid no part of that revenue, so that by this provision, the inhabitants of the commercial States are in this system obliged to bear an unreasonable and disproportionate share in the expences of the union, and the payment of that foreign and domestic debt, which was incurred not more for the benefit of the commercial than of the other States. In the sixth section of the first article, it is provided, that senators and representatives may be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, except such as shall have been created, or the emoluments of which have been increased during the time for which they were elected—Upon this subject, Sir, there was a great diversity of sentiment among the members of the convention—As the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, a senator or representative could not be appointed to any office under a particular State, or under the United States, during the time for which they were chosen, nor to any office under the United States until one year after the expiration of that time.4—It was said, and in my opinion justly, that no good reason could be assigned why a senator or representative should [173]be incapacitated to hold an office in his own government, since it can only bind him more closely to his State, and attach him the more to its interests, which, as its representative, he is bound to consult and sacredly guard as far as is consistent with the welfare of the union, and therefore, at most, would only add the additional motive of gratitude for discharging his duty; and according to this idea, the clause which prevented senators or delegates from holding offices in their own States, was rejected by a considerable majority; but, Sir, we sacredly endeavoured to preserve all that part of the resolution which prevented them from being eligible to offices under the United States, as we considered it essentially necessary to preserve the integrity, independence, and dignity of the legislature, and to secure its members from corruption. I was in the number of those who was extremely solicitous to preserve this part of the report; but there was a powerful opposition made by such who wished the members of the legislature to be eligible to offices under the United States—Three different times did they attempt to procure an alteration, and as often failed, a majority firmly adhering to the resolution as reported by the committee—However, an alteration was at length, by dint of perseverance, obtained even within the last twelve days of the convention, for it happened after I left Philadelphia5—As to the exception that they cannot be appointed to offices created by themselves, or the emoluments of which are by themselves increased, it is certainly of little consequence, since they may easily evade it by creating new offices to which may be appointed the persons who fill the offices before created, and thereby vacancies will be made which may be filled by the members who for that purpose have created the new offices. It is true, the acceptance of an office vacates their seat, nor can they be re-elected during their continuance in office; but it was said, that the evil would first take place, that the price for the office would be paid before it was obtained—that vacating the seat of the person who was appointed to office, made way for the admission of a new member, who would come there as desirous to obtain an office as him whom he succeeded, and as ready to pay the price necessary to obtain it; in fine, that it would be only driving away the flies who were filled to make room for those that were hungry—And as the system is now reported, the president having the power to nominate to all offices, it must be evident, that there is no possible security for the integrity and independence of the legislature, but that they are most unduly placed under the influence of the president and exposed to bribery and corruption. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/11/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, Suffer an individual to lay before you his contemplations on the great subject that now engages your attention. To you it belongs, and may Heaven direct your judgment, to decide on the happiness of all future generations as well as the present. It is universally agreed, that the object of every just government is to render the people happy, by securing their persons and possessions from wrong. To this end it is necessary that there should be local laws and institutions; for a people inhabiting various climates will unavoidably have local habits and different modes of life, and these must be consulted in making the laws. It is much easier to adapt the laws to the manners of the people, than to make manners conform to laws. The idle and dissolute inhabitants of the south, require a different regimen from the sober and active people of the north. Hence, among other reasons, is derived the necessity of local governments, who may enact, repeal, or alter regulations as the circumstances of each part of the empire may require. This would be the case, even if a very great state was to be settled at once. But it becomes still more needful, when the local manners are formed, and usages sanctified by the practice of a [695]century and an half. In such a case, to attempt to reduce all to one standard, is absurd in itself, and cannot be done but upon the principle of power, which debases the people, and renders them unhappy, till all dignity of character is put away. Many circumstances render us an essentially different people from the inhabitants of the southern states. The unequal distribution of property, the toleration of slavery, the ignorance and poverty of the lower classes, the softness of the climate, and dissoluteness of manners, mark their character. Among us, the care that is taken of education, small and nearly equal estates, equality of rights, and the severity of the climate, renders the people active, industrious and sober. Attention to religion and good morals is a distinguishing trait in our character. It is plain, therefore, that we require for our regulation laws, which will not suit the circumstances of our southern brethren, and that laws made for them would not apply to us. Unhappiness would be the uniform product of such laws; for no state can be happy, when the laws contradict the general habits of the people, nor can any state retain its freedom, while there is a power to make and enforce such laws. We may go further, and say, that it is impossible for any single legislature so fully to comprehend the circumstances of the different parts of a very extensive dominion, as to make laws adapted to those circumstances. Hence arises in most nations of extensive territory, the necessity of armies, to cure the defect of the laws. It is actually under the pressure of such an absurd government, that the Spanish provinces have groaned for near three centuries; and such will be our misfortune and degradation, if we ever submit to have all the business of the empire done by one legislature. The contrary principle of local legislation by the representatives of the people, who alone are to be governed by the laws, has raised us to our present greatness; and an attempt on the part of Great-Britain, to invade this right, brought on the revolution, which gave us a separate rank among the nations. We even declared, that we would not be represented in the national legislature, because one assembly was not adequate to the purposes of internal legislation and taxation. (Remainder next Tuesday.)"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/12/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, Every candid mind will by this time I think be clearly convinced, that if the constitution of this Commonwealth has any validity, the ratification of a plan that would alter, much less of one that would dissolve the government, cannot be valid, unless by a mode provided by the Constitution itself. There are but two modes, to my knowledge, wherein any alterations can be made: One [699]has been mentioned, and it has been fully shewn that the ratification of the new Constitution by the state Convention would be in direct violation of that mode, and therefore not binding on the citizens of this State.—Let us now consider the other mode. In addition to the political compact contained in the Constitution of this State, it is bound by another as solemn and more extensive, the articles of Confederation. By the first, the “whole people convenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people:”1 and by the last, [“]the whole of the States covenants with each State, and each State with the whole of the States,”2 and the powers in the articles of Confederation, expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled, are paramount to and annul every power of the State Constitution, that is inconsistent with and opposed to them.3 A mode is provided in the Confederation for amending it. in the words following, “and the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State of the union, shall be perpetual, nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them unless such alterations be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.”4 A correspondent provision is made in the fourth article of the Bill of Rights of our State Constitution—(vide Constitution of Massachusetts)5 the exercise then of every power, jurisdiction and right, which is or may hereafter be by the people thus expressly delegated, is clearly relinquished on their part and will be binding on them. Had the federal Convention reported and Congress agreed to alterations in the articles of Confederation, there could I think have been no doubt, that the ratification of such alterations by the legislature would have been as binding on the people as if made by themselves, because in the article mentioned of the bill of rights, the people have recognized the articles of Confederation, which on the part of the State were ratified, pursuant to their authority: And have expressly provided by those articles, that alterations therein which shall be agreed to by Congress, and confirmed by the legislatures, shall become part thereof: The legislature nevertheless of this State, would probably have applied to the people for their sense on such alterations, before a confirmation thereof, but no one will pretend to say that the federal Convention have reported alterations, or if they had, that Congress have agreed to, or the legislature confirmed them. The federal Convention, have, as has been shewn, reported a system, which destroys the articles of Confederation, and completely embraces the consolidation of the union: They have also recommended, that this new system should be administered, when ratified by nine States, and it must clearly appear, that the ratification of it by the Convention of this State, would not only be a violation of the State Constitution, but also of the articles of Confederation—[700] would thus be a double act of political perfidy—and would not be binding on any State, not even on those which may thus ratify it. Such a measure, therefore would not only tear up by the roots, and annihilate all confidence in the most sacred and solemn covenants between the whole people and each citizen of this State, but also between the whole of the States and each State, and the new Constitution would not stand on the ground of right, good faith, or publick confidence. Notwithstanding then the good intentions of the federal Convention, it is an unfortunate circumstance that they did not strictly adhere to their powers, because the mode proposed for ratification, as well as the system itself, must produce great convulsions. Sir William Temple, in treating “of popular discontents,” says, “The first safety of Princes and States lies in avoiding all councils or designs of innovation in ancient and established forms, and laws, especially those concerning liberty, property and religion (which are the possessions men will ever have most at heart) and thereby leaving the channel of honour and common justice clear and undisturbed.”6 The new system was not only unauthorized, but altogether unexpected by Congress, the legislature, and the people, is not merely an innovation, but an interchange of the “established form” of government; and will produce as great a charge in the laws concerning liberty and property—does not only disturb, and in some instances alter but in others destroys the channels of honour and common justice—and so far is the mode of adoption from being constitutional, as that it violates the Constitutions of the States and of the union, and establishes a precedent, not only for annihilating the new Constitution itself, but for building on its ruins a compleat system of despotism—for what will the people have to secure them against an introduction of the most arbitrary government, after the banishment of good faith from the United States of America? Is it not incumbent then on the State Convention, to consider seriously and thoroughly, in what a situation they will place this Commonwealth and the union, by the proposed ratification? This State, before it shall have declared in favour of the new system as it stands, may have great influence in promoting an accommodation of this matter, between contending States, and the contending citizens of each State, and having the confidence of all parties, may as a wise mediatrix, promote their common interest: But whet the State shall have manifested such a total disregard to the obligations of the most solemn political compacts, as to ratify in the mode proposed, the new Constitution, then will end the confidence of the union, and of our own citizens in the decision of Massachusetts, and she will embark in a precarious bottom, with the gloomy prospect of an approaching tempest, and unnecessarily expose herself to a political shipwreck.—If then, the new Constitution, ratified in its present form [701]and in the mode proposed, will not stand on the ground of right, good faith, or publick confidence, on what ground will it stand? Mr. Lock, in his treatise mentioned, chap. 17, sect. 197, says, “as conquest may be called a foreign usurpation, so usurpation is a kind of domestick conquest, with this difference, that an usurper can never have a right on his side, it being no usurpation but when one has got into the possession of what another has a right to.” The right of originating a system for consolidating the union, belonged only to the people, but the federal Convention have taken possession of it, when called for a different purpose, and can any one say their proceedings are not founded in usurpation? The same author goes on, “this, so far as it is usurpation, is a change only of persons, but not of the forms and rules of the government. For if the usurper extend his power beyond what of right belonged to the lawful prince, or governour of the Commonwealth, it is tyranny added to usurpation.”7 Had the federal Convention then only exercised the powers of the people in originating a system of consolidation, it would have been nothing more than usurpation; but having changed the forms and rules of delegating powers to the federal government, the Convention have done what the governours or rulers of the Commonwealth had no right to do, and by promoting State Conventions to violate the most solemn compacts, have also done what the people themselves had no right to do, and as the principles and reasonings of the above celebrated writer apply more forcibly to the alteration or formation, than to the administration of government, are not the proceedings of the Convention, founded not only in usurpation, but also in tyranny? To what purpose then is it, to raise this mighty superstructure, which having no foundation, must soon fall and involve those in it in inevitable ruin—the federal Convention were undoubtedly urged to these measures by conceiving, that their system, if well adapted to the welfare of the people, would nevertheless meet with opposition from some of the States, and be thus defeated: But did not an honest zeal lead the Convention, as it has often lead others if to a remedy worse than the disease? Should not a proper system have been sent in a constitutional mode to the States, with a presumption that every State would do what was for the good of the whole; and if any of them had withheld their assent from a measure requisite for the general welfare, and thus rendered a separation necessary; should it not have been preceeded by a declaration, stating the reasons and necessity of such a separation? Surely such a dismemberment will require as much solemnity as that which separated us from Great-Britain, and may produce as important consequences. Many great objections to the new system have been unanswered, and I conceive, if we mean to support our liberties, are unanswerable: Notwithstanding which the State Convention will in all probability be warmly urged to accept the system, and at the same time to propose amendments—this indeed may take in the weak and unwary, but not persons of discernment: For a wise people will never place over themselves an arbitrary government, in expectation that it will be so remarkably virtuous as to divest itself of unreasonable and unlimitted powers. Is not this contrary to human nature, which is generally grasping at more power, not knowing often times that it would be abused as soon as obtained? The new Constitution provides “that the Congress whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress:”—To call a Convention then, two thirds of both houses of the new Congress must deem it necessary, or the legislatures of two thirds of the several States must make an application to Congress; and can it be doubted that there will not be found such a majority of the new Congress, or of the State legislatures disposed to call a Convention for making amendments? When the Constitution is adopted, will not the friends of it strenuously contend to give it a trial? Are there not numbers who at this time openly reprobate republican governments? And will not such persons raise numberless objections to the appointment of such a Convention, and endeavour to prevent it? But supposing a Convention should be called, what are we to expect from it, after having ratified the proceedings of the late federal Convention? They will be called to make “amendments” an indefinite term, that may be made to signify any thing. Should Judge M’Kean, be of the new Convention, perhaps he will think a system of despotism,8 an amendment to the present plan, and should the next change be only to a monarchial government, the people may think themselves very happy, for bad as the new system is, it is the best they will ever have should they now adopt it. If therefore, it is the intention of the Convention of this State to preserve republican principles in the federal government, they must accomplish it before, for they never can expect to effect it after a ratification of the new system."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/15/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. The seventh section of this article [i.e., Article I] was also the subject of contest.—It was thought by many members of the convention, that it was very wrong to confine the origination of all revenue bills to the house of representatives, since the members of the senate will be chosen by the people as well as the members of the house of delegates, if not immediately, yet mediately, being chosen by the members of the State legislature, which members are elected by the people, and that it makes no real difference whether a person doth a thing in person, or by a deputy, or agent, appointed by him for that purpose. That no argument can be drawn from the house of Lords in the British constitution, since they are neither mediately or immediately the representatives of the people, but are one of the three estates, composing that kingdom, having hereditary rights and privileges distinct from, and independent of, the people. That it may, and probably will be a fruitful source of dispute and controversy between the two branches, what are, or are not, revenue bills, and the more so, as they are not defined in the constitution; which controversies may be difficult to settle, and may become serious in their consequences, there being no power in the constitution to decide upon, or authorised in cases of absolute necessity to terminate them by a prorogation or dissolution of either of the branches; a remedy provided in the British constitution, where the King has that power, which has been found necessary at times to be exercised in case of violent dissentions between the Lords and Commons on the subject of money bills. That every regulation of commerce—every law relative to excises—stamps—the post-office—the imposition of taxes, and their collection—the creation of courts and offices;—in fine, every law for the union, if enforced by any pecuniary sanctions, as they would tend to bring money into the continental treasury, might and probably would be considered a revenue act—That consequently the senate, the members of whom will probably be the most select in their choice, and consist of men the most enlightened and of the greatest abilities, who from the duration of their appointment, and the permanency of their body, will probably be best acquainted with the common concerns of the States, and with the means of providing for them, will be rendered almost useless as a part of the legislature; and that they will have but little to do in that capacity, except patiently to wait the proceedings of the house of representatives, and afterwards examine and approve, or propose amendments. There were also objections to that part of this section which relates to the negative of the president. There were some who thought no good reason could be assigned for giving the president a negative of any kind—Upon the principle of a check to the proceedings of the legislature, it was said to be unnecessary—That the two branches having a controul over each others proceedings—and the senate being chosen by the State legislatures, and being composed of members from the different States, there would always be a sufficient guard against measures being hastily or rashly adopted. That the president was not likely to have more wisdom or integrity than the senators, or any of them, or to better know or consult the interest of the States, than any member of the senate, so as to be entitled to a negative on that principle—And as to the precedent from the British constitution (for we were eternally troubled with arguments and precedents from the British government) it was said it would not apply. The King of Great-Britain there composed one of the three estates of the kingdom—he was possessed of rights and privileges, as such, distinct from the Lords and Commons; rights and privileges which descended to his heirs, and were inheritable by them; that for the preservation of these it was necessary he should have a negative, but that this was not the case with the president of the United States, who was no more than an officer of government, the sovereignty of which was not in him, but in the legislature—And it was further urged, even if he was allowed a negative, it ought not to be of so great extent as that given by the system, since his single voice is to countervail the whole of either branch, and any number less than two-thirds of the other; however, a majority of the convention was of a different opinion, and adopted as it now makes a part of the system. By the eighth section of this article, Congress is to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.—When we met in convention after our adjournment, to receive the report of the committee of detail, the members of that committee were requested to inform us what powers were meant to be vested in Congress by the word duties in this section, since the word imposts extended to duties on goods imported, and by another part of the system no duties on exports were to be laid.—In answer to this inquiry we were informed, that it was meant to give the general government the power of laying stamp duties on paper, parchment and vellum. We then proposed to have the power inserted in express words, least disputes hereafter might arise on the subject, and that the meaning might be understood by all who were to be affected by it; but to this it was objected, because it was said that the word stamp would probably sound odiously in the ears of many of the inhabitants, and be a cause of objection. By the power of imposing stamp duties the Congress will have a right to declare that no wills, deeds, or other instruments of writing shall be good and valid, without being stamped—that without being reduced to writing and being stamped, no bargain, sale, transfer of property, or contract of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be binding; and also that no exemplifications of records, depositions, or probates of any kind shall be received in evidence, unless they have the same solemnity—They may likewise oblige all proceedings of a judicial nature to be stamped to give them effect—those stamp duties may be imposed to any amount they please, and under the pretence of securing the collection of these duties, and to prevent the laws which imposed them from being evaded, the Congress may bring the decision of all questions relating to the conveyance, disposition and rights of property and every question relating to contracts between man and man into the courts of the general government.—Their inferior courts in the first instance and the superior court by appeal. By the power to lay and collect imposts, they may impose duties on any or every article of commerce imported into these States to what amount they please. By the power to lay excises, a power very odious in its nature, since it authorises officers to go into your houses, your kitchens, your cellars, and to examine into your private concerns, the Congress may impose duties on every article of use or consumption, on the food that we eat—on the liquors we drink—on the cloathes that we wear—the glass which enlighten our houses—or the hearths necessary for our warmth and comfort. By the power to lay and collect taxes, they may proceed to direct taxation on every individual either by a capitation tax on their heads, or an assessment on their property. By this part of the section therefore, the government has a power to lay what duties they please on goods imported—to lay what duties they please [180]afterwards on whatever we use or consume—to impose stamp duties to what amount they please, and in whatever cases they please—afterwards to impose on the people direct taxes, by capitation tax, or by assessment, to what amount they choose, and thus to sluice them at every vein as long as they have a drop of blood, without any controul, limitation or restraint—while all the officers for collecting these taxes, stamp duties, imposts and excises, are to be appointed by the general government, under its direction, not accountable to the States; nor is there even a security that they shall be citizens of the respective States, in which they are to exercise their offices; at the same time the construction of every law imposing any and all these taxes and duties, and directing the collection of them, and every question arising thereon, and on the conduct of the officers appointed to execute these laws, and to collect these taxes and duties so various in their kinds, are taken away from the courts of justice of the different States, and confined to the courts of the general government, there to be heard and determined by judges holding their offices under the appointment not of the States, but of the general government.⟩2 Many of the members, and myself in the number, thought that the States were much better judges of the circumstances of their citizens, and what sum of money could be collected from them by direct taxation, and of the manner in which it could be raised, with the greatest ease and convenience to their citizens, than the general government could be; and that the general government ought not in any case to have the power of laying direct taxes, but in that of the delinquency of a State. Agreeable to this sentiment, I brought in a proposition on which a vote of the convention was taken. The proposition was as follows: “And wherever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue should be raised by direct taxation, having apportioned the same by the above rule, requisitions shall be made of the respective States to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas within a time in the said requisition to be specified, and in case of any of the States failing to comply with such requisition, then and then only, to have power to devise and pass acts directing the mode and authorising the collection of the same.”3 Had this proposition been acceded to, the dangerous and oppressive power in the general government of imposing direct taxes on the inhabitants, which it now enjoys in all cases, would have been only vested in it in case of the non-compliance of a State, as a punishment for its delinquency, and would have ceased that moment that the State complied with the requisition—But the proposition was rejected by a majority, consistent with their aim and desire of encreasing the power of the general government as far as possible, and destroying the powers and influence of the States—And though there is a provision that all duties, imposts and [181]excises shall be uniform, that is, to be laid to the same amount on the same articles in each State, yet this will not prevent Congress from having it in their power to cause them to fall very unequal and much heavier on some States than on others, because these duties may be laid on articles but little or not at all used in some States, and of absolute necessity for the use and consumption of others, in which case the first would pay little or no part of the revenue arising therefrom, while the whole or nearly the whole of it would be paid by the last, to wit, the States which use and consume the articles on which the imposts and excises are laid.} By our original articles of confederation, the Congress have a power to borrow money and emit bills of credit on the credit of the United States—Agreeable to which was the report on this system as made by the committee of detail. When we came to this part of the report a motion was made to strike out the words “to emit bills of credit;” against the motion we urged, that it would be improper to deprive the Congress of that power—that it would be a novelty unprecedented to establish a government which should not have such authority—That it was impossible to look forward into futurity so far as to decide that events might not happen that should render the exercise of such a power absolutely necessary—And that we doubted whether if a war should take place it would be possible for this country to defend itself without having recourse to paper credit, in which case there would be a necessity of becoming a prey to our enemies, or violating the constitution of our government; and that considering the administration of the government would be principally in the hands of the wealthy there could be little reason to fear an abuse of the power by an unnecessary or injurious exercise of it—But, Sir, a majority of the convention, being wise beyond every possible event, and being willing to risque any political evil rather than admit the idea of a paper emission, in any possible event, refused to trust this authority to a government, to which they were lavishing the most unlimited powers of taxation, and to the mercy of which they were willing blindly to trust the liberty and property of the citizens of every State in the union; and they erased that clause from the system.—⟨Among other powers given to this government in the eighth section it has that of appointing tribunals inferior to the supreme court; to this power there was an opposition. It was urged that there was no occasion for inferior courts of the general government to be appointed in the different States, and that such ought not to be admitted—That the different State judiciaries in the respective States would be competent to, and sufficient for, the cognizance in the first instance of all cases that should arise under the laws of the general government, which being by this system made [182]the supreme law of the States, would be binding on the different State judiciaries—That by giving an appeal to the supreme court of the United States, the general government would have a sufficient check over their decisions, and security for the enforcing of their laws—That to have inferior courts appointed under the authority of Congress in the different States, would eventually absorb and swallow up the State judiciaries, by drawing all business from them to the courts of the general government, which the extensive and undefined powers, legislative and judicial, of which it is possessed, would easily enable it to do—That it would unduly and dangerously encrease the weight and influence of Congress in the several States, be productive of a prodigious number of officers, and be attended with an enormous additional and unnecessary expence—That the judiciaries of the respective States not having power to decide upon the laws of the general government, but the determination on those laws being confined to the judiciaries appointed under the authority of Congress in the first instance, as well as on appeal, there would be a necessity for judges or magistrates of the general government, and those to a considerable number, in each county of every State—That there would be a necessity for courts to be holden by them in each county and that these courts would stand in need of all their proper officers such as sheriffs, clerks and others commissioned, under the authority of the general government—In fine, that the administration of justice, as it will relate to the laws of the general government would require in each State all the magistrates, courts, officers and expence, which is now found necessary in the respective States for the administration of justice as it relates to the laws of the State governments.—But here again we were overruled by a majority, who assuming it as a principle that the general government and the State governments (as long as they should exist) would be at perpetual variance and enmity, and that their interests would constantly be opposed to each other, insisted for that reason that the State judges being citizens of their respective States, and holding their commission under them, ought not though acting on oath, to be entrusted in the administration of the laws of the general government.⟩4 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/15/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, The question then arises, what is the kind of government best adapted to the object of securing our persons and possessions from violence? I answer, a federal republick. By this kind of government each state reserves to itself the right of making and altering its laws for internal regulation, and the right of executing those laws without any external restraint, while the general concerns of the empire are committed to an assembly of delegates, each accountable to his own constituents. This is the happy form under which we live, and which seems to mark us out as a people chosen of God. No instance can be produced of any other kind of government so stable and energetick as the republican. The objection drawn from the Greek and Roman states does not apply to the question. Republicanism appears there in its most disadvantageous form. Arts and domestick employments were generally committed to slaves, while war was almost the only business worthy of a citizen. Hence arose their internal dissensions. Still they exhibited proofs of legislative wisdom and judicial integrity hardly to be found among their monarchick neighbours. On the other hand we find Carthage cultivating commerce, and extending her dominions for the long space of seven centuries, during which term the internal tranquillity was never disturbed by her citizens. Her national power was so respectable, that for a long time it was doubtful whether Carthage or Rome should rule. In the form of their government they bore a strong resemblance to each other. Rome might be reckoned a free state for about four hundred and fifty years. We have then the true line of distinction between those two nations, and a strong proof of the hardy materials which compose a republican government. If there was no other proofs, we might with impartial judges risk lie issue upon this alone. But our proof rests not here. The present state of Europe, and the vigour and tranquillity of our own governments, after experiencing this form for a century and an half, are decider proofs in favour of those governments which encourage commerce. A comparison of our own country, first with Europe and then with he other parts of the world, will prove, beyond a doubt, that the greatest share of freedom is enjoyed by the citizens, so much more does commerce flourish, The reason is, that every citizen has an influence [721]in making the laws, and thus they are conformed to the general interests of the state; but in every other kind of government they are frequently made in favour of a part of the community at the expense of the rest. The argument against republicks, as it is derived from the Greek and Roman states, is unfair. It goes on the idea that no other government is subject to be disturbed. As well might we conclude, that a limited monarchy is unstable, because, that under the feudal system, the nobles frequently made war upon their king, and disturbed the publick peace. We find, however, in practice, that limited monarchy is more friendly to commerce, because more friendly to the rights of the subject, than an absolute government; and that it is more liable to be disturbed than a republick, because less friendly to trade and the rights of individuals. There cannot, from the history of mankind, be produced an instance of rapid growth in extent, in numbers, in arts, and in trade, that will bear any comparison with our country. This is owing to what the friends of the new system, and the enemies of the revolution, for I take them to be nearly the same, would term our extreme liberty. Already, have our ships visited every part of the world, and brought us their commodities in greater perfection, and at a more moderate price, than we ever before experienced. The ships of other nations croud to our ports, seeking an intercourse with us. All the estimates of every party make the balance of trade for the present year to be largely in our favour. Already have some very useful, and some elegant manufactures got established among us, so that our country every day is becoming independent in her resources. Two thirds of the continental debt has been paid since the war, and we are in alliance with some of the most respectable powers of Europe. The western lands, won from Britain by the sword, are an ample fund for the principal of all our publick debts; and every new sale excites that manly pride, which is essential to national virtue. All this happiness arises from the freedom of our institutions and the limitted nature of our government; a government that is respected from principles of affection, and obeyed with alacrity. The sovereigns of the old world are frequently, though surrounded with armies, treated with insult; and the despotick monarchies of the east, are the most fluctuating, oppressive and uncertain governments of any form hitherto invented. These considerations are sufficient to establish the excellence of our own form, and the goodness of our prospects. Let us now consider the probable effects of a consolidation of the separate states into one mass; for the new system extends so far. Many ingenious explanations have been given of it; but there is this defect, [722]that they are drawn from maxims of the common law, while the system itself cannot be bound by any such maxims. A legislative assembly has an inherent right to alter the common law, and to abolish any of its principles, which are not particularly guarded in the constitution. Any system therefore which appoints a legislature, without any reservation of the rights of individuals, surrender all power in every branch of legislation to the government. The universal practice of every government proves the justness of this remark; for in every doubtful case it is an established rule to decide in favour of authority. The new system is, therefore, in one respect at least, essentially inferiour to our state constitutions. There is no bill of rights, and consequently a continental law may controul any of those principles, which we consider at present as sacred; while not one of those points, in which it is said that the separate governments misapply their power, is guarded. Tender acts and the coinage of money stand on the same footing of a consolidation of power. It is a mere fallacy, invented by the deceptive powers of mr. Wilson, that what rights are not given are reserved.2 The contrary has already been shewn. But to put this matter of legislation out of all doubt, let us compare together some parts of the book; for being an independent system this is the only way to ascertain its meaning. In article III. section 2, it is declared, that “the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority.” Among the cases arising under this new constitution are reckoned, “all controversies between citizens of different states,” which include all kinds of civil causes between those parties. The giving Congress a power to appoint courts for such a purpose is as much, there being no stipulation to the contrary, giving them power to legislate for such causes, as giving them a right to raise an army, is giving them a right to direct the operations of the army when raised. But it is not left to implication. The last clause of article I. section 8. expressly gives them power “to make all laws which shall be needful and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.” It is, therefore, as plain as words can make it, that they have a right by this proposed form to legislate for all kinds of causes respecting property between citizens of different states. That this power extends to all cases between citizens of the same state, is evident, from the sixth article, which declares all continental laws and treaties to be the supreme law of the land, and hat all state judges are bound thereby, “any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” If this is not binding [723]the judges of the separate states in their own office, by continental rules, it is perfect nonsense. There is then a complete consolidation of the legislative powers in all cases respecting property. This power extends to all cases between a state and citizens of another state. Hence a citizen, possessed of the notes of another state, may bring his action, and there is no limitation that the execution shall be levied on the publick property of the state, but the property of individuals is liable. This is a foundation for endless confusion and discord. This, right to try causes between a state and citizens of another state, involves in it all criminal causes; and a man who has accidentally transgressed the laws of another state, must be transported, with all his witnesses, to a third state, to be tried. He must be ruined to prove his innocence. These are necessary parts of the new system, and it will never be complete till they are reduced to practice. They effectually prove a consolidation of the states, and we have before shewn the ruinous tendency of such a measure. By sect. 8, of article 1. Congress are to have the unlimitted right to regulate commerce, external and internal, and may therefore create monopolies which have been universally injurious to all the subjects of the countries that have adopted them, excepting the monopolists themselves. They have also the unlimited right to imposts and all kinds of taxes, as well to levy as to collect them. They have indeed very nearly the same powers claimed formerly by the British parliament. Can we have so soon forgot our glorious struggle with that power, as to think a moment of surrendering it now? It makes no difference in principle whether the national assembly was elected for seven years or for six. In both cases we should vote to great disadvantage, and therefore ought never to agree to such an article. Let us make provision for the payment of the interest of our part of the debt, and we shall be fairly acquitted. Let the fund be an impost on our foreign trade, and we shall encourage our manufactures. But if we surrender the unlimitted right to regulate trade and levy taxes, imposts will oppress our foreign trade for the benefit of other states, while excises and taxes will discourage our internal industry. The right to regulate trade, without any limitations, will, as certainly as it is granted, transfer the trade of this state to Pennsylvania. That will be the seat of business and of wealth, while the extremes of the empire will, like Ireland and Scotland, be drained to fatten an overgrown capital. Under our present equal advantages, the citizens of this state come in for their full share of commercial profits. Surrender the rights of taxation and commercial regulation, and the landed states at the southward will all be interested in draining our resources; for whatever can be got by impost on our trade and excises [724]or our manufactures, will be considered as so much saved to a state inhabited by planters. All savings of this sort ought surely to be made in favour of our own state; and we ought never to surrender the unlimitted powers of revenue and trade to uncommercial people. If we do, the glory of the state from that moment departs, never to return. The safety of our constitutional rights consists in having the business of government lodged in different departments, and in having each part well defined. By this means each branch is kept within the constitutional limits. Never was a fairer line of distinction than what may be easily drawn between the continental and state governments. The latter provide for all cases, whether civil or criminal, that can happen ashore, because all such causes must arise within the limits of some state. Transactions between citizens may all be fairly included in this idea, even although they should arise in passing by water from one state to another. But the intercourse between us and foreign nations, properly forms the department of Congress. They should have the power of regulating trade under such limitations as should render their laws equal. They should have the right of war and peace, saving the eq[u]ality of rights, and the territory of each state. But the power of naturalization and internal regulation should not be given them. To give my scheme a more systematick appearance, I have thrown it into the form of a resolve, which is submitted to your wisdom for amendment, but not as being perfect. “Resolved, that the form of government proposed by the federal convention, lately held in Philadelphia, be rejected on the part of this commonwealth; and that our delegates in Congress are hereby authorised to propose on the part of this commonwealth, and, if the other states for themselves agree thereto, to sign an article of confederation, as an addition to the present articles, in the form following, provided such agreement be made on or before the first day of January, which will be in the year of our Lord 1790; the said article shall have the same force and effect as if it had been inserted in the original confederation, and is to be construed consistently with the clause in the former articles which restrains the United States from exercising such powers as are not expressly given.3 [“]XIV.4 The United States shall have power to regulate, whether by treaty, ordinance, or law, the intercourse between these states and foreign dominions and countries, under the following restrictions. No treaty, ordinance, or law shall give a preference to the ports of one state over those of another; nor 2d. impair the territory or internal [725]authority of any state; nor 3d. create am monopolies or exclusive companies; nor 4th. naturalise any foreigners. All their imposts and prohibitions shall be confined to foreign produce and manufactures imported, and to foreign ships trading in our harbours. All imposts and confiscations shall be to the use of the state where they shall accrue, excepting only such branches of impost, as shall be assigned by the separate states to Congress for a fund to defray the interest of their debt, and their current charges. In order the more effectually to execute this and the former articles, Congress shall have authority to appoint courts, supreme & subordinate, with power to try all crimes, not relating to state securities, between any foreign state, or subject of such state, actually residing in a foreign country, and not being an absentee or person who has alienated himself from these states on the one part, and any of the United States or citizens thereof on the other part; also all causes in which foreign ambassadours or other foreign ministers resident here shall be immediately concerned, respecting the jurisdiction or immunities only. And the Congress shall have authority to execute the judgment of such courts by their own affairs. Piracies and felonies committed on the high seas shall also belong to the department of Congress for them to define, try, and punish, in the same manner as the other causes shall be defined, tried, and determined. All the before mentioned causes shall be tried by jury, and in some seaport town. And it is recommended to the general court at their next meeting to provide and put Congress in possession of funds arising from foreign imports and ships sufficient to defray our share of the present annual expenses of the continent.” Such a resolve explicitly limitting the powers granted is the farthest we can proceed with safety. The scheme of accepting the report of the Convention, and amending it afterwards, is merely delusive. There is no intention among those who make the proposition to amend it at all. Besides, if they have influence enough to get it accepted in its present form, there is no probability, that they will consent to an alteration when possessed of an unlimited revenue. It is an excellence in our present confederation, that it is extremely difficult to alter it. An unanimous vote of the states is required.5 But this newly proposed form is founded in injustice, as it proposes that a fictitious consent of only nine states shall be sufficient to establish it. Nobody can suppose that the consent of a state is any thing more than a fiction, in the view of the federalists, after the mobbish influence used over the Pennsylvania convention. The two great leaders of the plan, with a modesty of Scotsmen, placed a rabble in the gallery to applaud their speeches, and thus [726]supplied their want of capacity in the argument. Repeatedly were Wilson and M’Kean worsted in the argument by the plain good sense of Findly and Smilie.6 But reasoning or knowledge had little to do with the federal party. Votes were all they wanted by whatever means obtained. Means not less criminal have been mentioned among us. But votes that are bought can never justify a treasonable conspiracy. Better, far better, would it be to reject the whole, and remain in possession of present advantages. The authority of Congress to decide disputes between states is sufficient to prevent their recurring to hostility: and their different situation, wants and produce is a sufficient foundation for the most friendly intercourse. All the arts of delusion and legal chicanery will be used to elude your vigilance, and obtain a majority. But keeping the constitution of the state, and the publick interest in view, will be your safety. (We are obliged, contrary to our intention, to postpone the remainder of Agrippa till our next.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/18/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. By the eighth section, of the first article, the Congress have also a power given them to raise and support armies without any limitation as to numbers, and without any restriction in time of peace. Thus, Sir, this plan of government, instead of guarding against a standing army, that engine of arbitrary power, which has so often and so successfully been used for the subversion of freedom, has, in its formation, given it an express and [188]constitutional sanction, and hath provided for its introduction; nor could this be prevented: I took the sense of the convention on a proposition, by which the Congress should not have power, in time of peace, to keep embodied more than a certain number of regular troops—that number to be ascertained by what should be considered a respectable peace establishment.—This proposition was rejected by a majority,2 it being their determination, that the power of Congress to keep up a standing army, even in peace should only be restrained by their will and pleasure. This section proceeds further to give a power to the Congress to provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.—As to giving such a power there was no objection; but it was thought by some, that this power ought to be given with certain restrictions—It was thought that not more than a certain part of the militia, of any one State, ought to be obliged to march out of the same, or be employed out of the same, at any one time, without the consent of the legislature of such State—This amendment I endeavoured to obtain;3 but it met with the same fate, which attended almost every attempt to limit the powers given to the general government, and constitutionally to guard against their abuse, it was not adopted.—As it now stands, the Congress will have the power, if they please, to march the whole militia of Maryland to the remotest part of the union, and keep them in service as long as they think proper, without being in any respect dependant upon the Government of Maryland for this unlimited exercise of power over its citizens.—All of whom, from the lowest to the greatest, may, during such service, be subjected to military law, and tied up and whipped at the halbert like the meanest of slaves. By the next paragraph, Congress is to have the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States.— For this extraordinary provision, by which the militia, the only defence and protection which the States can have for the security of their rights against arbitrary encroachments of the general government, is taken entirely out of the power of their respective States, and placed under the power of Congress, it was speciously assigned as a reason, that the general government would cause the militia to be better regulated and better disciplined than the State governments, and that it would be proper for the whole militia of the union, to have a uniformity in their arms and exercise.—To this it was answered, that the reason, however specious, was not just;—that it would be absurd the militia of the western settlements, who were exposed to an Indian enemy, should either be confined to the same arms or exercise, as the militia of the eastern or middle States—that the same penalties which would be sufficient to enforce [189]an obedience to militia laws in some States, would be totally disregarded in others—That leaving the power to the several States, they would respectively best know the situation and circumstances of their citizens, and the regulations that would be necessary and sufficient to effect a well regulated militia in each—That we were satisfied the militia had heretofore been as well disciplined, as if they had been under the regulations of Congress; and that the States would now have an additional motive to keep their militia well disciplined, and fit for service, as it would be their only chance to preserve there [i.e., their] existence against a general government, armed with powers sufficient to destroy them.—These observations, Sir, procured from some of the members an open avowal of those reasons, by which we believed before that they were actuated—They said, that as the States would be opposed to the general government, and at enmity with it, which as I before observed, they assumed as a principle, if the militia was under the controul and the authority of the respective States, it would enable them to thwart and oppose the general government:—They said the States ought to be at the mercy of the general government, and, therefore, that the militia ought to be put under its power, and not suffered to remain under the power of the respective States.—In answer to these declarations, it was urged, that if after having obtained to the general government the great powers already granted, and among those, that of raising and keeping up regular troops without limitation, the power over the militia should be taken away from the States, and also given to the general government, it ought to be considered as the last coup de grace to the State governments; that it must be the most convincing proof, the advocates of this system design the destruction of the State governments, and that no professions, to the contrary, ought to be trusted; and that every State in the union, ought to reject such a system with indignation, since, if the general government should attempt to oppress and enslave them, they could not have any possible means of self defence; because the proposed system, taking away from the States the right of organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, the first attempt made by a State to put the militia in a situation to counteract the arbitrary measures of the general government, would be construed into an act of rebellion, or treason; and Congress would instantly march their troops into the State.—It was further observed, that when a government wishes to deprive their citizens of freedom, and reduce them to slavery, it generally makes use of a standing army for that purpose, and leaves the militia in a situation as contemptible as possible, least [i.e., lest] they might oppose its arbitrary designs—That in this system, we give the general government every provision it could wish for, and even invite it to subvert the liberties of the States and their [190]citizens, since we give them the right to encrease and keep up a standing army as numerous as it would wish, and by placing the militia under its power, enable it to leave the militia totally unorganized, undisciplined, and even to disarm them;4 while the citizens, so far from complaining of this neglect, might even esteem it a favour in the general government, as thereby they would be freed from the burthen of militia duties, and left to their own private occupations or pleasures.—However, all arguments, and every reason that could be urged on this subject, as well as on many others, were obliged to yield to one that was unanswerable, a majority upon the division. By the ninth section of this article, the importation of such persons as any of the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person. The design of this clause is to prevent the general government from prohibiting the importation of slaves, but the same reasons which caused them to strike out the word “national,” and not admit the word “stamps,” influenced them here to guard against the word “slaves,” they anxiously sought to avoid the admission of expressions which might be odious in the ears of Americans, although they were very willing to admit into their system those things which the expressions signified: And hence it is, that the clause is so worded, as really to authorise the general government to impose a duty of ten dollars on every foreigner who comes into a State to become a citizen, whether he comes absolutely free, or qualifiedly so as a servant—although this is contrary to the design of the framers, and the duty was only meant to extend to the importation of slaves. This clause was the subject of a great diversity of sentiment in the convention;—as the system was reported by the committee of detail, the provision was general, that such importation should not be prohibited, without confining it to any particular period.—This was rejected by eight States—Georgia, South-Carolina, and I think North-Carolina voting for it.5 We were then told by the delegates of the two first of those States, that their States would never agree to a system which put it in the power of the general government to prevent the importation of slaves, and that they, as delegates from those States, must withhold their assent from such a system. A committee of one member from each State was chosen by ballot, to take this part of the system under their consideration, and to endeavour to agree upon some report which should reconcile those States;—to this committee also was referred the following proposition, [191]which had been reported by the committee of detail, to wit, “No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two-thirds of the members present in each house;” a proposition which the staple and commercial States were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce should be placed too much under the power of the eastern States, but which these last States were as anxious to reject.—This committee, of which also I had the honour to be a member, met and took under their consideration the subjects committed to them; I found the eastern States, notwithstanding their aversion to slavery, were very willing to indulge the southern States, at least with a temporary liberty to prosecute the slave trade, provided the southern States would in their turn gratify them, by laying no restriction on navigation acts; and after a very little time, the committee, by a great majority, agreed on a report, by which the general government was to be prohibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited time, and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts was to be omitted.6 This report was adopted by a majority of the convention, but not without considerable opposition.—It was said, that we had but just assumed a place among independent nations, in consequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great-Britain to enslave us—that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation of those rights, to which God and Nature had entitled us, not in particular, but in common with all the rest of mankind—That we had appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of freedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the rights which he had thus imparted to his creatures—that now, when we scarcely had risen from our knees, from supplicating his aid and protection—in forming our government over a free people, a government formed pretendedly on the principles of liberty and for its preservation,—in that government to have a provision, not only putting it out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade, but even encouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States power and influence in the union, in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly sport with the rights of their fellow creatures, ought to be considered as a solemn mockery of, and insult to, that God whose protection we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in detestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of liberty in the world.—It was said, it ought to be considered that national crimes can only be, and frequently are, punished in this world by national punishments, and that the continuance of the slave trade, and thus giving it a national sanction and encouragement, ought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and vengeance of Him, who is equal Lord of all, and who views with equal eye, the poor African slave and his American master!

Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,Landholder,Maryland Gazette,,1/18/1788,"Mr. WILLIAM GODDARD: Sir, As the Publication under the Signature of the CONNECTICUT LANDHOLDER, is circulating remote from the place of Mr. Gerry’s residence, and is calculated not only to injure that honourable gentleman in his private character, but also to weaken the effect of his opposition to the government proposed by the late convention, and thereby promote the adoption of a system, which I consider destructive of the rights and liberties of the respective states, and of their citizens; I beg leave, through the channel of your Paper, to declare to the Public, that from the time I took my seat in convention, which was early in June, until the fourth day of September, when I left Philadelphia, I am satisfied I was not ten minutes absent from convention while sitting (excepting only five days in the beginning of August, immediately after the committee of detail had reported, during which but little business was done.)1 That during my attendance, I never heard Mr. Gerry, or any other member, introduce a proposition for the redemption of continental money according to its nominal, or any other value, nor did I ever hear that such a proposition had been offered to consideration, or had been thought of. I was intimate with Mr. Gerry, and never heard him express in private conversation, or otherwise, a wish for the redemption of continental money, or assign the want of such a provision as a defect—Nor did I ever hear in convention, or any where else, such a motive of conduct attributed to Mr. Gerry.2 I also declare to the Public, that a considerable time before I left the convention, Mr. Gerry’s opposition to the system was warm and decided—that in a particular manner he strenuously opposed that provision by which the power and authority over the militia is taken away from the states and given to the general government—that in the debate he declared, if that measure was adopted, it would be the most convincing proof that the destruction of the state governments, and the introduction of a King was designed, and that no declarations to the contrary ought to be credited, since it was giving the states the last coup de grace, by taking from them the only means of self-preservation.3 The conduct of the advocates and framers of this system, towards the thirteen states, in pretending it was designed for their advantage, and gradually obtaining power after power to the general government, which could not but end in their slavery, he compared to the conduct of a number of jockeys, who had thirteen young colts to break—they begin with the appearance of kindness, giving them a lock of hay, or a handful of oats, and stroaking them while they eat, until being rendered sufficiently gentle, they suffer a halter to be put round their necks—obtaining a further degree of their confidence, the jockeys slip, a curb bridle on their heads, and the bit into their mouths, after which the saddle follows of course, and well booted and spurred, with good whips in their hands, they mount and ride them at their pleasure, and although they may kick and flounce a little at first, not being able to get clear of their riders, they soon become as tame and passive as their masters could wish them. In the course of public debate in the convention, Mr. Gerry applied to the system of government, as then under discussion, the words of Pope with respect to vice, “that it was a monster of such horrid mien, as to be hated need but to be seen.”4 And some time before I left Philadelphia, he in the same public manner, declared in convention, that he should consider himself a traitor to his country, if he did not oppose the system there, and also when he left the convention. These, Sir, are facts which I do not fear being contradicted by any member of the convention, and will, I apprehend, satisfactorily shew that Mr. Gerry’s opposition proceeded from a conviction in his own mind, that the government, if adopted, would terminate in the destruction of the states, and in the introduction of a kingly government. I am, Sir, your very obedient servant, Baltimore, January 13, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/18/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, To tell us that we ought to look beyond local interests, and judge for the good of the empire, is sapping the foundation of a [742]free state. The first principle of a just government is, that it shall operate equally. The report of the convention is extremely unequal. It takes a larger share of power from some, and from others, a larger share of wealth. The Massachusetts will be obliged to pay near three times their present proportion towards continental charges. The proportion is now ascertained by the quantity of landed property, then it will be by the number of persons. After taking the whole of our standing revenue, by impost and excise, we must still be held to pay a sixth part of the remaining debt. It is evidently a contrivance to help the other states at our expense. Let us then be upon our guard, and do no more than the present confederation obliges. While we make that our beacon we are safe. It was framed by men of extensive knowledge and enlarged ability, at a time when some of the framers of the new plan were hiding in the forests to secure their precious persons.2 It was framed by men, who were always in favour of a limitted government, and whose endeavours Heaven has crowned with success. It was framed by men, whose idols were not power and high life, but industry and constitutional liberty, and who are now in opposition to this new scheme of oppression. Let us then cherish the old confederation like the apple of our eye. Let us confirm it by such limitted powers to Congress, and such an enlarged intercourse, founded on commerce and mutual want, with the other states, that our union shall outlast time itself. It is easier to prevent an evil than to cure it. We ought therefore to be cautious of innovations. The intrigues of interested politicians will be used to seduce even the elect. If the vote passes in favour of the plan, the constitutional liberty of our country is gone forever. If the plan should be rejected, we always have it in our power, by a fair vote of the people at large, to extend the authority of Congress. This ought to have been the mode pursued. But our antagonists were afraid to risk it. They knew that the plan would not bear examining. Hence we have seen them insulting all who were in opposition to it, and answering arguments only with abuse. They have threatened and they have insulted the body of the people. But I may venture to appeal to any man of unbiassed judgment, whether his feelings tell him, that there is any danger at all in rejecting the plan. I ask not the palsied or the jaundiced, nor men troubled with bilious or nervous affections, for they can see danger in every thing. But I apply to men who have no personal expectations from a change, and to men in full health. The answer of all such men will be, that never was a better time for deliberation. Let us then, while we have it in our power, secure the happiness and freedom of the present and future ages. To accept of the report [743]of the convention, under the idea that we can alter it when we please, will be sporting with fire-brands arrows and death. It is a system which must have an army to support it, and there can be no redress but by a civil war. If, as the federalists say, there is a necessity of our receiving it, for heaven’s sake let our liberties go without, our making a formal surrender. Let us at least have the satisfaction of protesting against it, that our own hearts may not reproach us for the meanness of deserting our dearest interests. Our present system is attended with the inestimable advantage of preventing unnecessary wars. Foreign influence is assuredly smaller in our publick councils, in proportion as the members are subject to be recalled. At present, their right to sit continues no longer than their endeavours to secure the publick interest. It is therefore not an object for any foreign power to give a large price for the friendship of a delegate in Congress. If we adopt the new system, every member will depend upon thirty thousand people, mostly scattered over a large extent of country, for his election. Their distance from the seat of government will make it extremely difficult for the electors to get information of his conduct. If he is faithful to his constituents, his conduct will be misrepresented, in order to defeat his influence at home. Of this we have a recent instance, in the treatment of the dissenting members of the late federal convention.3 Their fidelity to their constituents was their whole fault. We may reasonably expect similar conduct to be adopted, when we shall have rendered the friendship of the members valuable to foreign powers, by giving them a secure seat in Congress. We shall too have all the intrigues, cabals and bribery practised, which are usual at elections in Great-Britain. We shall see and lament the want of publick virtue; and we shall see ourselves bought at a publick market, in order to be sold again to the highest bidder. We must be involved in all the quarrels of European powers, and oppressed with expense, merely for the sake of being like the nations round about us. Let us then, with the spirit of freemen, reject the offered system, and treat as it deserves the proposition of men who have departed from their commission; and let us deliver to the rising generation the liberty purchased with our blood."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/19/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow citizen, The proceedings of the federal Convention, having, as has been shewn, originated in usurpation, and being founded in tyranny, cannot be ratified by the State Convention, without breaking down the barriers of liberty; trampling on the authority of federal and State Constitutions, and annihilating in America, governments founded in compact. In this predicament, there appears but two measures which can with safety be adopted by the Convention of this State. One has been hinted at, an adjournment, until the sense of Virginia can be [748]known. The great danger in this business is, from precipitation, not from delay: The latter cannot injure whilst the former may irretrievably ruin us; an adjournment would not only ripen the judgment of our own citizens, but give them an opportunity of benefiting by the opinions of those States, which are attentive to, but not extravagantly zealous in this matter. The other measure is, to return the proceedings of the federal Convention to the legislature of this State, to be by them transmitted to Congress, and amended agreeably to the articles of Confederation: For the system being improperly before the State Convention, and they being incompetent to a ratification of it, cannot thereby bind the citizens of Massachusetts. Had the system been in itself unobjectionable, it is evident from what has been said, that the sentiments of the qualified voters on the necessity of a revision, must have been taken, and two thirds of them must have been in favour of it, before a State Convention could be called for amending the Constitution, much more for dissolving the government. Let us once more particularly attend to the system itself. It begins, “We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,” &c. “do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America”—In other words, We the people, do hereby publickly declare the violation of the faith which we have solemnly pledged to each other—do give the most unequivocal evidence, that we cannot ourselves, neither can any others, place the least confidence in our most solemn covenants, do effectually put an end in America, to governments founded in compact—do relinquish that security for life, liberty and property, which we had in the Constitutions of these States, and of the Union—do give up governments which we well understood, for a new system which we have no idea of—and we do, by this act of ratification and political suicide, destroy the new system itself, and prepare the way for a despotism, if agreeable to our rulers. All this we do, for the honour of having a system of consolidation formed by us the people. This is not magnifying, for such are the facts, and such will be the consequences. Indeed we find despotism not only in contemplation of the Pennsylvanians, but openly avowed in their State Convention, in the words following—“Despotism, if wisely administered, is the best system invented by the ingenuity of man.” This was declared by chief justice M’Kean2 and in such an high office, we must suppose him a man of too much precaution to have made the declaration, had he not known, that a majority of the Convention, and of the citizens, who so highly applauded his speeches, were of his opinion. M. Montesquieu, in his “Spirit of Laws,” 1st vol. book 3, chap. 9, says, “As virtue is necessary in a republick, and honour in a monarchy, so fear is necessary in a despotick government: With regard to virtue there is no occasion for it, and honour would be extremely [749]dangerous,”3 Thus has a declaration been made in Pennsylvania, in favour of a government which substitutes fear for virtue, and reduces men from rational beings to the level of brutes; and if the citizens of Massachusetts are disposed to follow the example, and submit their necks to the yoke, they must expect to be governed by the whip and goad But it is remarkable, that the resolution of the federal Convention, for transmitting the system to the people, provided, “that the Constitution should be laid before the United States in Congress assembled, and afterwards submitted to a Convention of Delegates, chosen in each State by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature[”]4 thus making Congress and the legislatures, vehicles of conveyance, but precluding them from passing their judgments on the system. Had it been submitted to their consideration, their members were men of such discernment, that the defects as well as excellencies of the plan, would have been clearly explained to the people; but immediately on the publication of it, we find measures were taken to prejudice the people against all persons in the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the States and Confederacy (if opposed to the plan) as being actuated by motives of private interest. Mr. Wilson, a member of the federal and Pennsylvanian Convention, in his town meeting speech, adopted this practice, which, to say the least of it, was very illiberal.5 Indeed, it is but justice to observe, that many artful advocates of this plan, to cover their designs of creating a government which will afford abundance of legislative offices for placemen and pensioners, proclaimed suspicions of others, and diverted the attention of the people from themselves, on whom the odium should fall. Let us now proceed to the provision in the system for a representation of the people, which is the corner stone of a free government. The Constitution provides, art. 1st, sect. 2, “that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States, which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons.” [“]Representatives” then are to be “apportioned among the several States, according to their respective numbers,” and five slaves, in computing those numbers, are to be classed with three freemen—By which rule, fifty thousand slaves, having neither liberty or property, will have a representative in that branch of the legislature—to which more especially will be committed, the protection of the liberties, and disposal of all the property of the freemen of the Union—for thus stands the new Constitution. Should it be said, that not the slaves but their masters are to send [750]a representative, the answer is plain—If the slaves have a right to be represented, they are on a footing with freemen, three of whom can then have no more than an equal right of representation with three slaves, and these when qualified by property, may elect or be elected representatives, which is not the case: But if they have not a right to be represented, their masters can have no right derived from their slaves, for these cannot transfer to others what they have not themselves. Mr. Locke, in treating of political or civil societies, chap. 7, sect. 85, says, that men “being in the state of slavery, not capable of any property, cannot, in that state, be considered as any part of civil society, the chief end whereof, is the preservation of property.”6 If slaves, then, are no part of civil society, there can be no more reason in admitting them, than there would be in admitting the beasts of the field, or trees of the forest, to be classed with free electors. What covenant are the freemen of Massachusetts about to ratify? A covenant that will degrade them to the level of slaves, and give to the States who have as many blacks as whites, eight representatives, for the same number of freemen as will enable this State to elect five—Is this an equal, a safe, or a righteous plan of government? Indeed it is not. But if to encrease these objections, it should be urged, “that representation being regulated by the same rule as taxation, and taxation being regulated by a rule intended to ascertain the relative property of the States, representation will then be regulated by the principle of property.” This answer would be the only one that could be made, for representation, according to the new Constitution is to be regulated, either by numbers or property. Let us now inquire of those who take this ground, what right they have to put a construction on the constitution, which is repugnant to the express terms of the Constitution itself? This provides, “that representatives shall be apportioned among the several States, according to their respective numbers.” Not a word of property is mentioned, but the word “numbers” is repeatedly expressed—Admitting however that property was intended by the Constitution as the rule of representation, does this mend the matter? It will be but a short time, after the adoption of the new Constitution, before the State legislatures, and establishments in general will be so burthensome and useless as to make the people desirous of being rid of them, for they will not be able to support them. The State appointment of Representatives will then cease, but the principle of representation according to property, will undoubtedly be retained, and before it is established it is necessary to consider whether it is a just one, for of once it is adopted it will not be easily altered.—According to this principle, a man worth £.50,000 is to have as many votes for representatives in the new Congress, as one thousand men, worth £.50 each: And [751]sixty such nabobs may send two representatives, while sixty thousand freemen having £.50 each can only send the same number. Does not this establish in the representative branch of the new Congress, a principle of aristocracy, with a vengeance? The Constitution of the several States, admit of no such principle, neither can any freeman with safety thus surrender, not only the intire disposition of their property, but also, the controul of their liberties and lives to a few opulent citizens. Should it be said that the rule of federal taxation, being advantageous to the State, it should be content with the same rule for representation. The answer is plain, the rule gives no advantage, but is supposed to be advantageous to Massachusetts, and to be an accommodation very beneficial to the southern States: But admiting this State will be benefited by the rule, is it disposed to sell its birthright, the right of an equal representation in the federal councils for so small a consideration? Would this State give up that right to any State that would pay our whole proportion of direct and indirect taxes? Shall we relinquish some of the most essential rights of government, which are our only security for every thing dear to us, to avoid our proportion of the publick expense? shall we give up all we have, for a small part of it? This if agreed to, would be no great evidence of our wisdom or foresight. But it is not probable, in the opinion of some of the ablest advocates for the new system, that direct taxes will ever be levied on the States, and if not, the provision for levying such taxes will be nugatory: We shall receive no kind of benefit from it, and shall have committed ourselves to the mercy of the states having slaves, without any consideration whatever. Indeed, should direct taxes be necessary, shall we not by increasing the representation of those States, put it in their power to prevent the levying such taxes, and thus defeat our own purposes? Certainly we shall, and having given up a substantial and essential right, shall in lieu of it, have a mere visionary advantage. Upon the whole then, it must be evident, that we might as well have committed ourselves to the parliament of Great-Britain, under the idea of a virtual representation as in this manner resign ourselves to the federal government."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/22/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It was urged that by this system, we were giving the general government full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which general power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit the slave trade—it must appear to the world absurd and disgraceful to the last degree, that we should except from the exercise of that power, the only branch of commerce, which is unjustifiable in its nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind—That on the contrary, we ought rather to prohibit expressly in our constitution, the further importation of slaves; and to authorize the general government from time to time, to make such regulations as should be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery, and the emancipation of the slaves which are already in the States. That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates us to tyranny and oppression.—It was further urged, that by this system of government, every State is to be protected both from foreign invasion and from domestic insurrections; that from this consideration, it was of the utmost importance it should have a power to restrain the importation of slaves, since in proportion as the number of slaves were encreased in any State, in the same proportion the State is weakened and exposed to foreign invasion, or domestic insurrection, and by so much the less will it be able to protect itself against either; and therefore will by so much the more, want aid from, and be a burthen to, the union.—It was further said, that as in this system we were giving the general government a power under the idea of national character, or national interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have prohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing instalment laws, &c.—It must appear still more extraordinary, that we should prohibit the government from interfering with the slave trade, than which nothing could so materially affect both our national honour and interest.—These reasons influenced me both on the committee and in convention, most decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes a part of the system.2 You will perceive, Sir, not only that the general government is prohibited from interfering in the slave trade before the year eighteen hundred and eight, but that there is no provision in the constitution that it shall afterwards be prohibited, nor any security that such prohibition will ever take place—and I think there is great reason to believe that if the importation of slaves is permitted until the year seventeen [i.e., [197]eighteen] hundred and eight, it will not be prohibited afterwards—At this time we do not generally hold this commerce in so great abhorrence as we have done.—When our own liberties were at stake, we warmly felt for the common rights of men3—The danger being thought to be past, which threatened ourselves, we are daily growing more insensible to those rights—In those States who have restrained or prohibited the importation of slaves, it is only done by legislative acts which may be repealed—When those States find that they must in their national character and connection suffer in the disgrace, and share in the inconveniences attendant upon that detestable and iniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the benefits arising from it, and the odium attending it will be greatly effaced by the sanction which is given to it in the general government. By the next paragraph, the general government is to have a power of suspending the habeas corpus act, in cases of rebellion or invasion. As the State governments have a power of suspending the habeas corpus act, in those cases, it was said there could be no good reason for giving such a power to the general government, since whenever the State which is invaded or in which an insurrection takes place, finds its safety requires it, it will make use of that power—And it was urged, that if we gave this power to the general government, it would be an engine of oppression in its hands, since whenever a State should oppose its views, however arbitrary and unconstitutional, and refuse submission to them, the general government may declare it to be an act of rebellion, and suspending the habeas corpus act, may seize upon the persons of those advocates of freedom, who have had virtue and resolution enough to excite the opposition, and may imprison them during its pleasure in the remotest part of the union, so that a citizen of Georgia might be bastiled in the furthest part of New-Hampshire—or a citizen of New-Hampshire in the furthest extreme to the south, cut off from their family, their friends, and their every connection—These considerations induced me, Sir, to give my negative also to this clause.4 In this same section there is a provision that no preference shall be given to the ports of one State over another, and that vessels bound to or from one State shall not be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties in another.—This provision, as well as that which relates to the uniformity of impost duties and excises, was introduced, Sir, by the delegation of this State.5—Without such a provision it would have been in the power of the general government to have compelled all ships sailing into, or out of the Chesapeak, to clear and enter at Norfolk or some port in Virginia—a regulation which would be extremely injurious to our commerce, but which would if considered merely as to the interest of the [198]union, perhaps not be thought unreasonable, since it would render the collection of the revenue arising from commerce more certain and less expensive. But, Sir, as the system is now reported, the general government have a power to establish what ports they please in each State, and to ascertain at what ports in every State ships shall clear and enter in such State, a power which may be so used as to destroy the effect of that provision, since by it may be established a port in such a place as shall be so inconvenient to the State as to render it more eligible for their shipping to clear and enter in another than in their own State; suppose, for instance the general government should determine that all ships which cleared or entered in Maryland, should clear and enter at George-Town, on Potowmack, it would oblige all the ships which sailed from, or was bound to, any other part of Maryland, to clear or enter in some port in Virginia. To prevent such a use of the power which the general government now has of limiting the number of ports in a State, and fixing the place or places where they shall be, we endeavoured to obtain a provision that the general government should only, in the first instance, have authority to ascertain the number of ports proper to be established in each State, and transmit information thereof to the several States, the legislatures of which, respectively, should have the power to fix the places where those ports should be, according to their idea of what would be most advantageous to the commerce of their State, and most for the ease and convenience of their citizens; and that the general government should not interfere in the establishment of the places, unless the legislature of the State should neglect or refuse so to do; but we could not obtain this alteration.6 By the tenth section, every State is prohibited from emitting bills of credit—As it was reported by the committee of detail, the States were only prohibited from emitting them without the consent of Congress;7 but the convention was so smitten with the paper money dread, that they insisted the prohibition should be absolute. It was my opinion, Sir, that the States ought not to be totally deprived of the right to emit bills of credit, and that as we had not given an authority to the general government for that purpose, it was the more necessary to retain it in the States—I considered that this State, and some others, have formerly received great benefit from paper emissions, and that if public and private credit should once more be restored, such emissions may hereafter be equally advantageous; and further, that it is impossible to foresee that events may not take place which shall render paper money of absolute necessity; and it was my opinion, if this power was not to be exercised by a State without the permission of the general government, it ought to be satisfactory [199]even to those who were the most haunted by the apprehensions of paper money; I, therefore, thought it my duty to vote against this part of the system.8 The same section also, puts it out of the power of the States, to make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, or to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. I considered, Sir, that there might be times of such great public calamities and distress, and of such extreme scarcity of specie as should render it the duty of a government for the preservation of even the most valuable part of its citizens in some measure to interfere in their favour, by passing laws totally or partially stopping the courts of justice—or authorising the debtor to pay by instalments, or by delivering up his property to his creditors at a reasonable and honest valuation.—The times have been such as to render regulations of this kind necessary in most, or all of the States, to prevent the wealthy creditor and the monied man from totally destroying the poor though even industrious debtor—Such times may again arrive.—I therefore, voted against depriving the States of this power,9 a power which I am decided they ought to possess, but which I admit ought only to be exercised on very important and urgent occasions.—I apprehend, Sir, the principal cause of complaint among the people at large is, the public and private debt with which they are oppressed, and which, in the present scarcity of cash, threatens them with destruction, unless they can obtain so much indulgence in point of time that by industry and frugality they may extricate themselves. This government proposed, I apprehend so far from removing will greatly encrease those complaints, since grasping in its all powerful hand the citizens of the respective States, it will by the imposition of the variety of taxes, imposts, stamps, excises and other duties, squeeze from them the little money they may acquire, the hard earnings of their industry, as you would squeeze the juice from an orange, till not a drop more can be extracted, and then let loose upon them, their private creditors, to whose mercy it consigns them, by whom their property is to be seized upon and sold in this scarcity of specie at a sheriffs sale, where nothing but ready cash can be received for a tenth part of its value, and themselves and their families to be consigned to indigence and distress, without their governments having a power to give them a moment’s indulgence, however necessary it might be, and however desirous to grant them aid. By this same section, every State is also prohibited from laying any imposts, or duties on imports or exports, without the permission of the general government.—It was urged, that as almost all sources of taxation were given to Congress it would be but reasonable to leave the States the power of bringing revenue into their treasuries, by laying a [200]duty on exports if they should think proper, which might be so light as not to injure or discourage industry, and yet might be productive of considerable revenue—Also, that there might be cases in which it would be proper, for the purpose of encouraging manufactures, to lay duties to prohibit the exportation of raw materials, and even in addition to the duties laid by Congress on imports for the sake of revenue, to lay a duty to discourage the importation of particular articles into a State, or to enable the manufacturer here to supply us on as good terms as they could be obtained from a foreign market; however, the most we could obtain was, that this power might be exercised by the States with, and only with the consent of Congress, and subject to its controul—And so anxious were they to seize on every shilling of our money for the general government, that they insisted even the little revenue that might thus arise, should not be appropriated to the use of the respective States where it was collected, but should be paid into the treasury of the United States; and accordingly it is so determined.10 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/22/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, Truly deplorable, in point of argument, must be that cause, in whose defence persons of acknowledged learning and ability can say nothing pertinent. When they undertake to prove that the person elected is the safest person in the world to controul the exercise of the elective; powers of his constituents, we know what dependence is to he had upon their reasonings. Yet we have seen attempts to shew, that the fourth section of the proposed constitution, is an additional security to our rights. It may be such in the view of a Rhode-Island family (I think that state is quoted) who have been for some time in the minority: but it is extraordinary, that an enlightened character in the Massachusetts [Convention] should undertake to prove, that, from a single instance of abuse in one state, another state ought to resign its liberty.2 Can an[y] man, in the free exercise of his reason, suppose, that he is perfectly represented in the legislature, when that legislature may at pleasure alter the time, manner, and place of election.3 By altering the time they may continue a representative during his whole life; by altering the manner, they may fill up the vacancies by their own votes without the consent of the people; and by altering the place, all the elections may be made at the seat of the federal government. Of all the powers of government perhaps this is the most improper to be surrendered. Such an article at once destroys the whole check which the Constituents have upon their rulers. I should be less zealous upon this subject, if the power had not been often abused. The senate of Venice, the regencies of Holland, and the British parliament have all abused it. The last have not yet perpetuated themselves; but they have availed themselves repeatedly of popular commotions to continue in power. Even at this day we find attempts to vindicate the usurpation by which they continued themselves from three to seven years. All the attempts, and many have been made, to return to triennial elections, have proved abortive. These instances are abundantly sufficient to shew with what jealousy this right ought to be guarded. No sovereign on earth need be afraid to declare his crown elective, while the possessor [771]has the right to regulate the time, manner, and place of election. It is vain to tell us, that the proposed government guarantees to each state a republican form. Republicks are divided into democraticks, and aristocraticks. The establishment of an order of nobles, in whom should reside all the power of the state, would be an aristocratick republick. Such has been for five centuries the government of Venice, in which all the energies of government, as well as of individuals, have been cramped by a distressing jealousy that the rulers have of each other. There is nothing of that generous, manly confidence that we see in the democratick republicks of our own country. It is a government of force, attended with perpetual fear of that force. In Great-Britain, since the lengthening of parliaments, all our accounts agree, that their elections are a continued scene of bribery, riot and tumult; often a scene of murder. These are the consequences of choosing seldom, and for extensive districts. When the term is short, nobody will give an high price for a seat. It is an insufficient answer to these objections to say, that there is no power of government but may sometimes be applied to bad purposes. Such a power is of no value unless it is applied to a bad purpose. It ought always to remain with the people. The framers of our state constitution were so jealous of this right, that they fixed the days for election, meeting and dissolving of the legislature, and of the other officers of government. In the proposed constitution not one of these points is guarded, though more numerous and extensive powers are given them than to any state legislature upon the continent. For Congress is at present possessed of the direction of the national force, and most other national powers, and in addition to them are to be vested with all the powers of the individual states, unrestrained by any declarations of right. If these things are for the security of our constitutional liberty, I trust we shall soon see an attempt to prove that the government by an army will be more friendly to liberty than a system founded in consent, and that five states will make a majority of thirteen. The powers of controuling elections, of creating exclusive companies in trade, of internal legislation and taxations ought, upon no account, to be surrendered. I know it is a common complaint, that Congress want more power. But where is the limitted government that does not want it? Ambition is in a governour what money is to a miser—he can never accumulate enough. But it is as true in politicks as in morals, he that is unfaithful in little, will be unfaithful also in much. He who will not exercise the powers he has, will never properly use more extensive powers. The framing entirely new systems, is a work that requires vast attention; and it is much easier to guard an old one. It is infinitely better to reject one that is unfriendly to liberty, and rest for a while satisfied [772]with a system that is in some measure defective, than to set up a government unfriendly to the rights of states, and to the rights of individuals—one that is undefined in its powers and operations. Such is the government proposed by the federal convention and such, we trust, you will have the wisdom and firmness to reject."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/25/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, That the new system, proposed for your adoption, is not founded in argument, but in party spirit, is evident from the whole behaviour of that party, who favour it. The following is a short, but genuine specimen of their reasoning. The South-Carolina legislature have established an unequal representation, and will not alter it:2 therefore Congress should be invested with an unrestrained power to alter [798]the time, manner and place of electing members into that body.3 Directly the contrary position should have been inferred. An elected assembly made an improper use of their right to controul elections, therefore such a right ought not to be lodged with them. It will be abided in ten instances, for one in which it will serve any valuable pin pose. It is said also that the Rhode Island assembly intend to abuse their power in this respect,4 therefore we should put Congress in a situation to abuse theirs. Surely this is not a kind of reasoning that, in the opinion of any indifferent person, can vindicate the fourth section. Yet we have heard it publickly advanced as being conclusive. The unlimitted power over trade, domestick as well as foreign, is another power that will more probably be applied to a bad than to a good purpose. That our trade was for the last year much in favour of the commonwealth is agreed by all parties. The freedom that every mar;, whether his capital is large or small, enjoys, of entering into any branch that pleases him, rouses a spirit of industry and exertion, that is friendly to commerce. It prevents that stagnation of business which generally precedes publick commotions. Nothing ought to be done to restrain this spirit. The unlimitted power over trade, however, is exceedingly apt to injure it. In most countries of Europe, trade has been confined by exclusive chapters. Exclusive companies are, in trade, pretty much like an aristocracy in government, and produces nearly as bad effects. An instance of in we have ourselves experienced. Before the revolution, we carried on to direct trade to India. The goods imported from that country, came to us through the medium of an exclusive company.5 Our trade in that. quarter is now respectable, and we receive several kinds of their goods at about half the former price.—But the evil of such companies does not terminate there. They always, by the greatness of their capital, have an undue influence on the government. In a republick, we ought to guard, as much as possible, against the predominance of any particular interest. It is the object of government to protect them all. When commerce is left to take its own course, the advantages of every class will be nearly equal.—But when exclusive privileges are given to any class, it will operate to the weakening of some other class connected with them. (Remainder next Tuesday.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/29/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. The second article, relates to the executive—his mode of election—his powers—and the length of time he should continue in office. On these subjects, there was a great diversity of sentiment—Many of the members were desirous that the president should be elected for seven years, and not to be eligible a second time—others proposed [213]that he should not be absolutely ineligible, but that he should not be capable of being chosen a second time, until the expiration of a certain number of years—The supporter of the above propositions, went upon the idea that the best security for liberty was a limited duration and a rotation of office in the chief executive department. There was a party who attempted to have the president appointed during good behaviour, without any limitation as to time, and not being able to succeed in that attempt, they then endeavoured to have him re-eligible without any restraint.—It was objected that the choice of a president to continue in office during good behaviour, would be at once rendering our system an elective monarchy—and, that if the president was to be re-eligible without any interval of disqualification, it would amount nearly to the same thing, since with the powers that the president is to enjoy, and the interest and influence with which they will be attended, he will be almost absolutely certain of being re-elected from time to time, as long as he lives—As the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, the president was to be chosen for seven years, and not to be eligible at any time after—In the same manner the proposition was agreed to in convention, and so was it reported by the committee of detail, although a variety of attempts were made to alter that part of the system by those who were of a contrary opinion, in which they repeatedly failed; but, Sir, by never losing sight of their object, and choosing a proper time for their purpose, they succeeded at length in obtaining the alteration, which was not made until within the last twelve days before the convention adjourned.2 As the propositions were agreed to by the committee of the whole house, the president was to be appointed by the national legislature, and as it was reported by the committee of detail, the choice was to be made by ballot in such a manner, that the States should have an equal voice in the appointment of this officer, as they, of right, ought to have; but those who wished as far as possible to establish a national instead of a federal government, made repeated attempts to have the president chosen by the people at large; on this the sense of the convention was taken, I think not less than three times while I was there, and as often rejected;3 but within the last fortnight of their session, they obtained the alteration in the manner it now stands, by which the large States have a very undue influence in the appointment of the president.—There is no case where the States will have an equal voice in the appointment of the president, except where two persons shall have each an equal number of votes, and those a majority of the whole number of electors, a case very unlikely to happen, or where no person has a [214]majority of the votes; in these instances the house of representatives are to choose by ballot, each State having an equal voice, but they are confined in the last instance to the five who have the greatest number of votes, which gives the largest States a very unequal chance of having the president chose under their nomination. As to the vice-president, that great officer of government, who is in case of death, resignation, removal or inability of the president, to supply his place, and be vested with his powers, and who is officially to be the president of the senate, there is no provision by which a majority of the voices of the electors are necessary for his appointment, but after it is decided who is chosen president, that person who has the next greatest number of votes of the electors, is declared to be legally elected to the vice-presidency, so that by this system it is very possible, and not improbable, that he may be appointed by the electors of a single large State; and a very undue influence in the senate is given to that State of which the vice-president, is a citizen, since in every question where the senate is divided that State will have two votes, the president having on those occasions a casting voice.—Every part of the system which relates to the vice-president, as well as the present mode of electing the president, was introduced and agreed upon after I left Philadelphia. Objections were made to that part of this article, by which the president is appointed commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, and it was wished to be so far restrained, that he should not command in person; but this could not be obtained.4—The power given to the president of granting reprieves and pardons, was also thought extremely dangerous, and as such opposed—The president thereby has the power of pardoning those who are guilty of treason, as well as of other offences; it was said that no treason was so likely to take place as that in which the president himself might be engaged—the attempt to assume to himself powers not given by the constitution, and establish himself in regal authority—in which attempt a provision is made for him to secure from punishment the creatures of his ambition, the associates and abettors of his treasonable practices, by granting them pardons should they be defeated in their attempts to subvert the constitution. To that part of this article also, which gives the president a right to nominate, and with the consent of the senate to appoint all the officers, civil and military, of the United States, there were considerable opposition—it was said that the person who nominates, will always in reality appoint, and that this was giving the president a power and influence which together with the other powers, bestowed upon him, would place him above all restraint and controul. In fine, it was urged, that the [215]president as here constituted, was a king in every thing but the name—that though he was to be chosen but for a limited time, yet at the expiration of that time if he is not re-elected, it will depend entirely upon his own moderation whether he will resign that authority with which he has once been invested—that from his having the appointment of all the variety of officers in every part of the civil department for the union, who will be very numerous—in them and their connexions, relations, friends and dependants, he will have a formidable host devoted to his interest, and ready to support his ambitious views.—That the army and navy, which may be encreased without restraint as to numbers, the officers of which from the highest to the lowest, are all to be appointed by him and dependant on his will and pleasure, and commanded by him in person, will, of course, be subservient to his wishes, and ready to execute his commands; in addition to which, the militia also are entirely subjected to his orders—That these circumstances, combined together, will enable him, when he pleases, to become a king in name, as well as in substance, and establish himself in office not only for his own life, but even if he chooses, to have that authority perpetuated to his family. It was further observed, that the only appearance of responsibility in the president, which the system holds up to our view, is the provision for impeachment; but that when we reflect that he cannot be impeached but by the house of delegates, and that the members of this house are rendered dependant upon, and unduly under the influence of the president, by being appointable to offices of which he has the sole nomination, so that without his favour and approbation, they cannot obtain them, there is little reason to believe that a majority will ever concur in impeaching the president, let his conduct be ever so reprehensible, especially too, as the final event of that impeachment will depend upon a different body, and the members of the house of delegates will be certain, should the decision be ultimately in favour of the president, to become thereby the objects of his displeasure, and to bar to themselves every avenue to the emoluments of government. Should he, contrary to probability, be impeached, he is afterwards to be tried and adjudged by the senate, and without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members who shall be present, he cannot be convicted—This senate being constituted a privy council to the president, it is probable many of its leading and influential members may have advised or concurred in the very measures for which he may be impeached; the members of the senate also are by the system, placed as unduly under the influence of, and dependent upon the president, as [216]the members of the other branch, since they also are appointable to offices, and cannot obtain them but through the favour of the president—There will be great, important and valuable offices under this government, should it take place, more than sufficient to enable him to hold out the expectation of one of them to each of the senators—Under these circumstances, will any person conceive it to be difficult for the president always to secure to himself more than one-third of that body? Or, can it reasonably be believed, that a criminal will be convicted who is constitutionally empowered to bribe his judges, at the head of whom is to preside on those occasions the chief justice, which officer in his original appointment, must be nominated by the president, and will therefore, probably, be appointed not so much for his eminence in legal knowledge and for his integrity, as from favouritism and influence, since the president knowing that in case of impeachment the chief justice is to preside at his trial, will naturally wish to fill that office with a person of whose voice and influence he shall consider himself secure.—These are reasons to induce a belief that there will be but little probability of the president ever being either impeached or convicted; but it was also urged, that vested with the powers which the system gives him and with the influence attendant upon those powers, to him it would be but of little consequence whether he was impeached or convicted, since he will be able to set both at defiance.—These considerations occasioned a part of the convention to give a negative to this part of the system establishing the executive as it is now offered for our acceptance. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/29/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, This appears to be the universal effect of such establishments. A point of such magnitude ought, then, to be particularly guarded. In some respects if is beneficial that a system of commerce should be established by national authority. But if it is found, as it will upon examination, that most governments establish those companies, from occasional and temporal motives, and that they produce ill effects on government and on trade; the power ought in this respect to be restrained. As we are situated at one extreme of the empire, two or three such companies would annihilate the importance of our seaports, by transferring the trade to Philadelphia. With the decay of trade is connected the depreciation of lands and estates for want of a market for the produce. At present our exports are great and our manufactures are every day rising in importance. It seems to be agreed on all sides, that from the port of Boston only the balance was last year as much as [822]an hundred & fifty thousand pounds in favour of the state; a comparison of that and former years is far from proving the distressed state of commerce. Complaints in that respect are about as well founded as in most others. They are made to serve a present purpose, and when that is accomplished, there is no redress for the disappointment of the publick expectation. It becomes us then to consider well of the powers before we surrender them. There is no recovering them when once given. It is vain to flatter ourselves with the idea, that three quarters of the members of the new government will ever be for restraining their own power.2 If it was so easy as the federalists pretend to procure an alteration of the system after its adoption, I think, that it is a circumstance not much in its favour. In order to be perfect a constitution should be permanent. The new system sets out with a violation of the compact between the states. While it is in discussion, we ought to consider, that injustice never can be the basis of a good government. I have me with an account of one government uniformly supported by that principle, and I do not wish even my antagonists to become the subjects of that kingdom. In answer to the favourite remark of the federalists, that what is not given is reserved, it is sufficient to reply, that the framers of the proposed constitution have themselves thought it necessary to make an explicit reservation of the power to grant titles of nobility. Why did they reserve this point, if it would not otherwise have been given up? The conversation of the party is in direct opposition to any design ever to alter the system in favour of the liberties of the people. It is said that a constitution is itself a bill of rights. The fallacy of this position is easily shewn, but the length of this paper makes it necessary to postpone that part of the argument. At present we shall only observe, that a constitution does not necessarily point out any other dependencies than of the parts of the government upon each other, and not those between the government and people. Has Venice no constitution? Yet the people have no share in the government."
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,1/29/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, As it is essentially necessary to the happiness of a free people, that the constitution of government should be established in [823]principles of truth, I have endeavoured, in a series of papers, to discuss the proposed form, with that degree of freedom which becomes a faithful citizen of the commonwealth. It must be obvious to the most careless observer, that the friends of the new plan appear to have nothing more in view than to establish it by a popular current, without any regard to the truth of its principles. Propositions, novel, erroneous and dangerous, are boldly advanced to support a system, which does not appear to be founded in, but in every instance to contradict, the experience of mankind. We are told, that a constitution is in itself a bill of rights; that all power not expressly given is reserved; that no powers are given to the new government which are not already vested in the state governments; and that it is for the security of liberty, that the persons elected should have the absolute controul over the time, manner and place of election. These, and an hundred other things of the like kind, though they have gained the hasty assent of men, respectable for learning and ability, are false in themselves, and invented merely to serve a present purpose. This will, I trust, clearly appear from the following considerations. It is common to consider man at first as in a state of nature, separate from all society. The only historical evidence, that the human species ever actually existed in this state, is derived from the book of Gen.1 There, it is said, that Adam remained a while alone. While the whole species was comprehended in his person was the only instance in which this supposed state of nature really existed. Ever since the completion of the first pair, mankind appear as natural to associate with their own species, as animals of any other kind herd together. Wherever we meet with their settlements, they are found in clans. We are therefore justified in saying, that a state of society is the natural state of man. Wherever we find a settlement of men, we find also some appearance of government. The state of government is therefore as natural to mankind as a state of society. Government and society appear to be co-eval. The most rude and artless form of government is probably the most ancient. This we find to be practised among the Indian tribes in America. With them the whole authority of government is vested in the whole tribe. Individuals depend upon their reputation of valour and wisdom to give them influence. Their government is genuinely democratical. This was probably the first kind of government among mankind, as we meet with no mention of any other kind, till royalty was introduced in the person of Nimrod. Immediately after that time, the Asiatick nations seem to have departed from the simple democracy, which is still retained by their American brethren, and universally adopted the kingly form. We do indeed meet with some vague rumors [824]of an aristocracy in India so late as the time of Alexander the great. But such stories are altogether uncertain and improbable. For in the time of Abraham, who lived about sixteen hundred years before Alexander, all the little nations mentioned in the Mosaick history appear to be governed by kings. It does not appear from any accounts of the Asiatick kingdoms that they have practised at all upon the idea of a limitted monarchy. The whole power of society has been delegated to the kings: and though they may be said to have constitutions of government, because the succession to the crown is limitted by certain rules, yet the people are not benefitted by their constitutions, and enjoy no share of civil liberty. The first attempt to reduce republicanism to a system, appears to be made by Moses when he led the Israelites out of Egypt. This government stood a considerable time, about five centuries, till in a frenzy the people demanded a king, that they might resemble the nations about them. They were dissatisfied with their judges, and instead of changing the administration, they madly changed their constitution. However they might flatter themselves with the idea, that an high spirited people could get the power back again when they pleased; they never did get it back, and they fared like the nations about them. Their kings tyrannized over them for some centuries, till they fell under a foreign yoke. This is the history of that nation. With a change of names, it describes the progress of political changes in other countries. The people are dazzled with the splendour of distant monarchies, and a desire to share their glory induces them to sacrifice their domestick happiness. From this general view of the state of mankind it appears, that all the power[s] of government originally reside in the body of the people; and that when they appoint certain persons to administer the government, they delegate all the powers of government not expressly reserved. Hence it appears, that a constitution does not in itself imply any more than a declaration of the relation which the different parts of the government bear to each other, but does not in any degree imply security to the rights of individuals. This has been the uniform practice. In all doubtful cases the decision is in favour of the government. It is therefore impertinent to ask by what right government exercises powers not expressly delegated. Mr. Wilson, the great oracle of federalism, acknowledges, in his speech to the Philadelphians, the truth of these remarks, as they respect the state governments, but attempts to set up a distinction between them and the continental government.2 To any body who will be at the trouble to read the new system, it is evidently [825]in the same situation as the state constitutions now possess. It is a compact among the people for the purposes of government, and not a compact between states. It begins in the name of the people and not of the states. It has been shown in the course of this paper, that when people institute government, they of course delegate all rights not expressly reserved. In our state constitution the bill of rights consists of thirty articles.3 It is evident therefore that the new constitution proposes to delegate greater powers than are granted to our own government, sanguine as the person was who denied it. The complaints against the separate governments, even by the friends of the new plan, are not that they have not power enough, but that they are disposed to make a bad use of what power they have. Surely then they reason badly, when they purpose to set up a government possess’d of much more extensive powers than the present, and subject to much smaller checks. Bills of rights, reserved by authority of the people, are, I believe, peculiar to America. A careful observance of the abuse practised in other countries has had its just effect by inducing our people to guard against them. We find the happiest consequences to flow from it. The separate governments know their powers, their objects, and operations. We are therefore not perpetually tormented with new experiments. For a single instance of abuse among us there are thousands in other countries. On the other hand, the people know their rights, and feel happy in the possession of their freedom, both civil and political. Active industry is the consequence of their security; and within one year the circumstances of the state and of individuals have improved to a degree never before known in this commonwealth. Though our bill of rights does not, perhaps, contain all the cases in which power might be safely reserved, yet it affords a protection to the persons and possessions of individuals not known in any foreign country. In some respects the power of government is a little too confined. In many other countries we find the people resisting their govern ours for exercising their power in an unaccustomed mode. But for want of a bill of rights the resistance is always by the principles of their government, a rebellion which nothing but success can justify. In our constitution we have aimed at delegating the necessary powers of government and confining their operation to beneficial purposes. At present we appear to have come very near the truth. Let us therefore have wisdom and virtue enough to preserve it inviolate. It is a state contrivance, to get the people into a passion, in order to make them sacrifice their liberty. Repentance always comes, but it comes too late. Let us not flatter ourselves that we [826]shall always have good men to govern us. If we endeavour to be like other nations we shall have more bad men than good ones to exercise extensive powers. That circumstance alone will corrupt them. While they fancy themselves the vicegerents of God, they will resemble him only in power, but will always depart from his wisdom and goodness."
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,1/30/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and fellow Citizens, Whoever has attended the debates of the Convention, must already be convinced, that the magnitude of the object, and the anxiety of the members, whether for or against the system as it stands, has produced a party spirit which augurs no good. It has now become a struggle for conquest; rather than for conviction: And great as the characters are which compose the Convention, their talents are more employed to make proselytes in favour or against than to investigate precisely and explain clearly the merits and demerits of the proposed Constitution. It must likewise appear, that so many able and eloquent speakers as there are in favour of it, from [834]the supreme executive, judicial and legislative departments, as well as from the bar, desk,2 medical and military professions, that there is not a prospect of doing justice to the objections against the plan. Should it, therefore, in this state of affairs, be carried by a small majority, what must be the consequences? They are too apparent, and too ruinous to contemplate, and every one is left to form his idea of them. The same would probably be the effect of a negative, and the farther we proceed in this business, the more evident is it, that an adjournment until the sense of Virginia and other States can be known, is not only proper, but indispensibly necessary for the peace and welfare of this State.—To persuade the people that this system will produce advantages which will never flow from it, or to conceal from them the burthen and coercion that will result from it, will be impolitick in the extreme, for the deception must appear as soon as the plan is administered, and the new administration itself will be overwhelmed, and all federal government be prostrated by an enraged and disappointed people. I am sensible that many worthy men are for adopting this plan, not because they approve of it, but from an idea that, we shall never obtain another; but what reason is there for this apprehension? The whole Continent are desirous of an efficient federal government—The first constitution proposed to the people of Massachusetts was rejected by them; it originated improperly as this did, and if it had not, it was not a good one. The people therefore made a second attempt, and succeeded in it; and is there not the same reason to hope for success in the present case? Or if we fail, that the attempt will probably make us unanimous in adopting this system? But is it not extraordinary, that a Constitution should be proposed by gentlemen, who had no authority whatever to form it—that they should dissolve themselves without knowing the objections of the people, and that the latter should now be told, they must take this or have none?—This may be language adapted to slaves, but not to freemen. By my last,3 I think it must fully appear, that the apportionment of representatives by the new system, is to be either according to numbers or property—If according to numbers, that we are to commit ourselves by a unequal representation to the States who are peopled in a great measure with slaves, and if according to property that we are to adopt in our representative branch the most extraordinary principle for establishing an aristocracy, that ever was imposed on a free people. The Constitution further provides, that “the actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term often years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.” The whole number of freemen [835]and slaves at this time, according to the best information, is about two millions seven hundred thousand, of which six hundred thousand at least are slaves—two millions one hundred thousand freemen then, and three hundred and sixty thousand, being three fifths of the slaves, will make the present enumeration two millions four hundred and sixty thousand.4 If we suppose (what considering the continual emigrations from the old to the new States cannot be admitted) that in every twenty years we shall double our numbers, at the end of three years the enumeration will be two millions eight hundred and twenty-nine thousand, and what is to be done with this enumeration? The Constitution in the next paragraph provides, that “the number of representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one representative, and until such enumeration shall be made, New-Hampshire shall be intitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight.” &c. &c. The people then are called upon to ratify a Constitution, which provides that they shall never have above one representative for thirty thousand inhabitants, without providing that they shall have one for that number: This clause, whilst it restrains the new government from allowing more than one representative to the number mentioned, authorizes it by making the rule of apportionment one or two hundred thousand inhabitants for each representative, to reduce their number to twenty-eight or even to fourteen. This is so clear, that the warmest advocate for the new system will risque his reputation for candour by denying it. If there was no discretionary power intended to be lodged in the new Congress, to reduce the number of representatives lower than one for every thirty thousand inhabitants, it would have been provided, that “the number of representatives” shall be at least one for every thirty thousand; and not as it now stands, “that it shall not exceed one” for that number. It may be said, perhaps, that the increase of the inhabitants will be such hereafter as that it will be necessary for Congress to have the power to make the rule of apportionment higher than thirty thousand; but why then was it not provided, that the people should be allowed one representative for every thirty thousand, until the representatives amounted to a certain number? Even two hundred representatives for a legislature, invested as this is to be, with almost unlimited powers, over the lives, liberties and property of the citizens of these States, is not too much at this early period:—Why should we then, having but sixty-five representatives, intrust Congress with a power to reduce this to a much less number? Perhaps it will be said, there is only a possibility of this evil; but in the progress of these papers I think it will appear there is a probability if not a certainty, that when Congress shall have established their revenue-acts and standing army, which will be [836]accomplished in a few years, they will reduce the number of representatives so low, and regulate their elections in such a manner, as effectually to destroy the representation of the people. Some indeed may say, that if it was greater than at present, it would be expensive and burthensome; but this is too trifling an objection to deserve refutation; for the people of the country know well, that their greatest security against a tyrannical government consists in a full and free representation—full as to number of representatives—free as to the right of election, and they are not thus to be bubbled out of their liberties. Should it be admitted, that at the end of three years there will be a representative for every thirty thousand inhabitants, the whole number in the federal legislature will then be ninety-four, and this State’s proportion thirteen, and after that time no alteration will be made until the year eighteen hundred and one: And are the citizens of this State disposed to commit every thing dear to them, for the space of thirteen years, to a government, constituted as the new one is to be, with only eight representatives for part of the time, and thirteen for the remainder of it?—Are the States having slaves, to have according to the number of freemen a much greater representation than this State? And if there had been no objection of this kind, are the State governments to be subject to annihilation, and when this is accomplished, is the principle of property, which is now contended for as the rule of apportionment, to be then the rule for electing representatives, whereby sixty or a less number of wealthy men, may elect as many representatives as sixty thousand yeomen? What is the number of freemen in Great-Britain, and how many representatives have they? The number, I think, is computed to be about eight millions, and “the number of English representatives, is five hundred and thirteen, and of Scots forty-five, in all five hundred and eighty-eight.” In this proportion we should have a representative for every thirteen thousand six hundred inhabitants, and this State would have thirty representatives in the new Congress. Will the people of this State intrust themselves to a government which will have the power, and every motive to reduce the number of representatives to one half or to one quarter of what they are now to be, and thus to deprive the citizens of their best security for liberty? I think they will not, and that it ought not to be expected of them. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/1/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. By the third article, the judicial power of the United States is vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts, as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.—These courts, and these only, will have a right to decide upon the laws of the United States, and all questions arising upon their construction, and in a judicial manner to carry those laws into execution; to which the courts both superior and inferior of the respective States and their judges and other magistrates are rendered incompetent.—To the courts of the general government are also confined all cases in law or equity, arising under the proposed constitution, and treaties made under the authority of the United States—all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls—all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction—all controversies to which the United States are a party—all controversies between two or more States—between a State and citizens of another State—between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States, and between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.—Whether therefore, any laws or regulations of the Congress, or any acts of its president or other officers are contrary to, or not warranted by the constitution, rests only with the judges, who are appointed by Congress to determine; by whose determinations every State must be bound.—Should any question arise between a foreign consul and any of the citizens of the United States, however remote from the seat of empire, it is to be heard before the judiciary of the general government, and in the first instance to be heard in the supreme court, however inconvenient to the parties, and however trifling the subject of dispute. Should the mariners of an American or foreign vessel, while in any American port, have occasion to sue for their wages, or in any other instance a controversy belonging to the admiralty jurisdiction should take place between them and their masters or owners, it is in the courts of the general government the suit must be instituted—and either party may carry it by appeal to its supreme court—the injury to commerce and the oppression to individuals which may thence arise need not be enlarged upon.—Should a citizen of Virginia, Pennsylvania, or any other of the United States be indebted to, or have debts due from, a citizen of this State, or any other claim be subsisting on one side or the other, in consequence of commercial or other transactions, it is only in the courts of Congress that either can apply for redress. The [268]case is the same should any claims subsist between citizens of this State and foreigners, merchants, mariners and others, whether of a commercial or of any other nature, they must be prosecuted in the same courts; and though in the first instance they may be brought in the inferior, yet an appeal may be made to the supreme judiciary, even from the remotest State in the union. The inquiry concerning, and trial of every offence against, and breach of the laws of Congress are also confined to its courts—the same courts also have the sole right to inquire concerning and try every offence, from the lowest to the highest, committed by the citizens of any other State, or of a foreign nation, against the laws of this State within its territory—and in all these cases the decision may be ultimately brought before the supreme tribunal, since the appellate jurisdiction extends to criminal as well as to civil cases. And in all those cases where the general government has jurisdiction in civil questions, the proposed constitution not only makes no provision for the trial by jury in the first instance, but by its appellate jurisdiction absolutely takes away that inestimable priviledge, since it expressly declares the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact.—Should, therefore, a jury be adopted in the inferior court, it would only be a needless expence, since on an appeal the determination of that jury even on questions of fact, however honest and upright, is to be of no possible effect—the supreme court is to take up all questions of fact—to examine the evidence relative thereto—to decide upon them in the same manner as if they had never been tried by a jury—Nor is trial by jury secured in criminal cases; it is true, that in the first instance, in the inferior court the trial is to be by jury, in this and in this only, is the difference between criminal and civil cases; but, Sir, the appellate jurisdiction extends, as I have observed, to cases criminal as well as to civil, and on the appeal the court is to decide not only on the law but on the fact, if, therefore, even in criminal cases the general government is not satisfied with the verdict of the jury, its officer may remove the prosecution to the supreme court, and there the verdict of the jury is to be of no effect, but the judges of this court are to decide upon the fact as well as the law, the same as in civil cases. Thus, Sir, jury trials, which have ever been the boast of the English constitution, which have been by our several State constitutions so cautiously secured to us,—jury trials which have so long been considered the surest barrier against arbitrary power, and the palladium of liberty,—with the loss of which the loss of our freedom may be dated, are taken away by the proposed form of government, not only in a great variety of questions between individual and individual, but in every case whether civil or criminal arising under the laws of the United States or the execution of those [269]laws.—It is taken away in those very cases where of all others it is most essential for our liberty, to have it sacredly guarded and preserved—in every case whether civil or criminal, between government and its officers on the one part and the subject or citizen on the other.—Nor was this the effect of inattention, nor did it arise from any real difficulty in establishing and securing jury trials by the proposed constitution, if the convention had wished so to do—But the same reason influenced here as in the case of the establishment of inferior courts;—as they could not trust State judges, so would they not confide in State juries.—They alledged that the general government and the State governments would always be at variance—that the citizens of the different States would enter into the views and interests of their respective States, and therefore ought not to be trusted in determining causes in which the general government was any way interested, without giving the general government an opportunity, if it disapproved the verdict of the jury, to appeal, and to have the facts examined into again and decided upon by its own judges, on whom it was thought a reliance might be had by the general government, they being appointed under its authority. Thus, Sir, in consequence of this appellate jurisdiction and its extension to facts as well as to law, every arbitrary act of the general government, and every oppression of all those variety of officers appointed under its authority for the collection of taxes, duties, impost, excise, and other purposes, must be submitted to by the individual, or must be opposed with little prospect of success and almost a certain prospect of ruin, at least in those cases where the middle and common class of citizens are interested—Since to avoid that oppression, or to obtain redress, the application must be made to one of the courts of the United States—by good fortune should this application be in the first instance attended with success, and should damages be recovered equivalent to the injury sustained, an appeal lies to the supreme court, in which case the citizen must at once give up his cause, or he must attend to it at the distance of perhaps more than a thousand miles from the place of his residence, and must take measures to procure before that court on the appeal all the evidence necessary to support his action, which even if ultimately prosperous must be attended with a loss of time, a neglect of business, and an expence which will be greater than the original grievance, and to which men in moderate circumstances would be utterly unequal. By the third section of this article it is declared that treason against the United States, shall consist in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid or comfort. By the principles of the American revolution, arbitrary power may and ought to be resisted even by arms if necessary—The time may come when it shall be the duty of a State, in order to preserve itself from the [270]oppression of the general government, to have recourse to the sword—In which case the proposed form of government declares that the State and every of its citizens who act under its authority are guilty of a direct act of treason—reducing by this provision the different States to this alternative that they must tamely and passively yield to despotism or their citizens must oppose it at the hazard of the halter if unsuccessful—and reducing the citizens of the State which shall take arms to a situation in which they must be exposed to punishment, let them act as they will, since if they obey the authority of their State government, they will be guilty of treason against the United States—if they join the general government they will be guilty of treason against their own State. To save the citizens of the respective States from this disagreeable dilemma, and to secure them from being punishable as traitors to the United States when acting expressly in obedience to the authority of their own State, I wished to have obtained as an amendment to the third section of this article the following clause: “Provided that no act or acts done by one or more of the States against the United States, or by any citizen of any one of the United States under the authority of one or more of the said States, shall be deemed treason or punished as such; but in case of war being levied by one or more of the States against the United States the conduct of each party towards the other, and their adherents respectively, shall be regulated by the laws of war and of nations.”2 But this provision was not adopted, being too much opposed to the great object of many of the leading members of the convention, which was by all means to leave the States at the mercy of the general government, since they could not succeed in their immediate and entire abolition. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,2/2/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, I am sensible it will be said the Constitution provides “that the electors in each State shall have the qualification requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.” But the new Constitution was evidently intended to, and must in its operation inevitably produce an abolition of the State governments, and when this is accomplished, the rule of apportionment of representatives according to property, must and will apply to electors, and have the effect mentioned. There would nevertheless be some consolation, if these were the only objections relative to representation in the new system, but in the second sect, of the first art. there is a provision that “no person shall be a representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty–five years, and been seven years a citizen of the United States,” &c. had tins provision extended to the foreigners, who under the government of the United States, had contended for the establishment of our independence, it would have met with no objection; but as it now stands, any foreigner having attained the age of twenty five years, having been seven years a citizen of the United States, and being an inhabitant of any State, may be elected a representative—and the right of being elected senators, is confirmed to foreigners who shall have attained “the age of thirty years,” and “who shall have been nine years a citizen of the United States, &c.” Thus are we to have a supreme legislature over us, to consist as well of foreigners, as of freemen of the United States.—CITIZENS OF AMERICA! What have you for a number of years been contending for? To what purpose have you expended so freely the blood and treasures of this country? To have a government with unlimited powers administered by foreigners? Will there not be immediately planted in the several States, men of abilities, who, having the appearance of privates, will nevertheless be in the pay of foreign powers? Will not such men ingratiate themselves into your favour, or, which will be much better for them, into the favour of the new government? And after seven years residence, will they not be in your federal house of representatives, or after nine years residence in your senate? Will not the most important secrets of your executive, respecting treaties and other matters, be by these means always open to European powers? Will you not be engaged in their trials? Will not your interest be sacrificed to their politicks? And will you not be the puppets of foreign Courts? Perhaps you will [844]be told that this provision will encourage emigrants, who will bring their money to America; but will you for such precarious and futile prospects consent to part with the right of governing yourselves? How carefully is this point guarded by Great–Britain. Judge Blackstone, book first, chap, tenth, says, “naturalization cannot be performed but by act of parliament, for by this an alien is put in exactly the same state as if he had been born in the king’s legiance, except only that he is incapable as well as a denizen of being a member of the privy council, or of parliament, no bill for naturalization can be received in either house of parliament without such disqualifying clause in it.”2 Other European powers are equally careful to exclude foreigners from their councils, whilst we, too wise to be benefited by the experience of governments which have existed for ages, and have attained the zenith of power, are adopting new principles, and exposing ourselves to evils which must inevitably lead us to destruction. What I before hinted respecting the danger of ratifying the new Constitution, as it stands, is now too evident to admit of a doubt: The opposition in Pennsylvania have been so imprudent as to burn in effigy, Judge M’Kean and Mr. Wilson, two of the leading members of their State Convention.3 The offenders are of obscure, and perhaps contemptible characters, and there is danger, that they will be arrested, without considering the probability of their having been excited to this outrage by men of influence—that the government will be opposed—and that a civil war will commence, which will flame through this continent, the consequences of which are to be dreaded: Thus will the fairest prospects that ever a people had of establishing for themselves good government, be at once blasted by imprudent zeal and cursed ambition. The virulent supporters of the new system, say, as those did in the parliament of Great–Britain, who pushed the American revenue–acts, that he opposition consists principally of men of low and vulgar minds, but the event will be much the same in the one case as in the other: The yeomenry supported by men of abilities and integrity in the several States, and standing on the ground of right, will maintain it; and in case of a war, will derive from this continent, many valuable men amongst us, who although now deceived by an aristocratick party, will be considered as usurpers and tyrants. These are not the apprehensions of a timid mind, they are predictions founded on our own experience, and God grant, that the wisdom of this Convention, on which is suspended the fate of America, may avert the impending evil. You have now the confidence of your countrymen, and it is hoped will not be deprived of it, by the arts of any individuals with interested views: You are now in [845]possession of an inestimable jewel, which if lost by a hasty ratification, will never be regained. It is not my wish to make any objections to the new system that are not well founded, and such I conceive to be those against biennial elections; For, considering the extent of the continent—the complicated business of the legislature—the experience requisite for its members—the necessity of their punctual attendance—and their arrangements for quitting their States, and familiar biennial elections, are not lengthy or dangerous; but can there be any reason, that in the first Congress, when the most important institutions and provisions will be made for carrying into effect the new system. Massachusetts, who according to her numbers of freemen, is entitled to nearly eleven out of sixty-five, should have but eight representatives? It must clearly appear, by my former numbers,4 that by the clause for regulating representation, we are to be reduced to the level of slaves, and that we shall soon be such, if the planters of the south are to send to the new Congress, representatives for three fifths of their negroes. But if this rule was even admissible, we are entitled to above nine representatives according to the present enumeration, and are told, as a consolation for having but eight members, that New-Hampshire has the deficient member, which to us is the same thing. This to me is unintelligible, for the members of both houses are to be paid out of the continental treasury, to which we shall contribute a full proportion according to our property: Why then should we give up to any State whatever, the important privilege of sending a representative? New-Hampshire is a good neighbour, but like other States, has her separate interests, and in pursuit of it, our’s may and will be sacrificed, by such an unreasonable concession. It is remarkable, that in the new system there is no qualification of property, for members of either branch of the federal legislature. It is surprizing to some gentlemen in Convention, that others should wish “to exclude from the federal government a good man, because he was not a rich one”5—No such thing is in contemplation, but on the other hand, they wish to send him there, and want to know what security there is, that a good man, not being wealthy, shall long continue to be eligible to such an office? If there was provision in the Constitution, that any citizen having three, six, or even nine hundred pounds estate, should be eligible, and that one of those sums should be requisite to qualify him, the publick would be equally guarded against a representation of persons having no property at all, and an exclusion of good men, because not wealthy: But the objection to the Constitution is, that it has no provision for securing the eligibility of good men. If good [846]members without much property, should oppose the wealthy but un-principled ones in Congress, and prevent their passing oppressive acts, such as revenue-acts, calculated to promote peculation—to protect defaulters—and to plunder the people, (as this system undoubtedly will of all their property) will not those unprincipled members exert themselves to pass an act, requiring for senators and representatives so high a qualification of property, as to exclude for ever from Congress, the good men who have not great estates? Surely they will, being fully authorized thereto by the omnipotent clause, enabling Congress “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers, vested by this Constitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or office thereof.” This I call an omnipotent clause, for I must believe the man who says, that he can see in its aphelion, a comet which requires a century for its revolution, as soon as him that says, he can see the extent to which an artful and arbitrary legislature, can by this clause stretch their powers. We shall next consider the most important clause respecting representation, in art. 1st. sect. 4th. which provides, “that the times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof: But the Congress may at any time by law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.”—Great ingenuity has been manifested in attempts to explain away the meaning and tendency of this fatal clause—a clause destructive of the small but best security which the people by the new system will have for preserving their liberties: Let us candidly attend to the arguments urged on this occasion. One is, that the legislatures, or as they are called the sovereignties of the States, are to be the constituents of the federal senate, and the people, the constituents of the house of representatives; that in the frequent struggles and contentions between these two branches to depress and control each other, each will be supported by its constituents, and therefore that the State legislatures, if uncontrouled by the federal legislature, would endeavour so to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding elections, as to deprive the people of their right of representation—Here, be sure, is the appearance of great tenderness for the rights of the people, and nothing but the appearance; for an imaginary danger of losing their rights is held up to them to introduce a remedy which must inevitably deprive them of those rights. That there will be such struggles and contentions between the two branches, is admitted—but is it natural to suppose, that the State legislatures, in aid of the federal senate, will wish to destroy the federal representation? Are not the members of one branch of the State legislatures in all the States [847]and of the other branch, in most of them, elected annually, or for a less time? Are not those members dependent on the people for reelections and equally with them affected by all federal and state laws? Can those members have any separate interest from the people for destroying the balance in the federal legislature? And if they could have such a separate interest, and should attempt to impair or destroy the right, of choosing federal representatives, would not the people instantly feel the injury, and leave out of the legislature men so inimical to their rights? was there no controuling power in the federal legislature for altering or regulating the times, plates, and manner of holding elections, would not the people, by annually electing those who are to make the regulations, have every check requisite for securing the right of elections? If, indeed, the members of the State legislatures held their offices independent of the people, and had separate interests, there would be some ground for the argument—but, dependent as they are, and having the same interests with the people, they cannot."
Newspaper,No,Mercy Otis Warren,,American Herald,,2/2/1788,"Mankind may amuse themselves with theoretick systems of liberty, and trace its social and moral effects on sciences, virtue, industry, and every improvement of which the human mind is capable; but we can only discern its true value by the practical and wretched effects of slavery; and thus dreadfully will they be realized, when the inhabitants of the Eastern States are dragging out a miserable existence, only on the gleanings of their fields; and the Southern, blessed with a softer and more fertile climate, are languishing in hopeless poverty; and when asked, what is become of the flower of their crop, and the rich produce of their farms–they may answer in the hapless stile of the Man of La Mancha,–“The steward of my Lord has seized and sent it to Madrid.”1–Or, in the more literal language of truth, The exigencies of government require that the collectors of the revenue should transmit it to the Federal City. Animated with the firmest zeal for the interest of this country, the peace and union of the American States, and the freedom and happiness of a people who have made the most costly sacrifices in the cause of liberty,–who have braved the power of Britain, weathered the convulsions of war, [275]and waded thro’ the blood of friends and foes to establish their independence and to support the freedom of the human mind; I cannot silently witness this degradation without calling on them, before they are compelled to blush at their own servitude, and to turn back their languid eyes on their lost liberties–to consider, that the character of nations generally changes at the moment of revolution.–And when patriotism is discountenanced and publick virtue becomes the ridicule of the sycophant–when every man of liberality, firmness, and penetration, who cannot lick the hand stretched out to oppress, is deemed an enemy to the State–then is the gulph of despotism set open, and the grades to slavery, though rapid, are scarce perceptible–then genius drags heavily its iron chain–science is neglected, and real merit flies to the shades for security from reproach–the mind becomes enervated, and the national character sinks to a kind of apathy with only energy sufficient to curse the breast that gave it milk, and as an elegant writer observes, “To bewail every new birth as an encrease of misery, under a government where the mind is necessarily debased, and talents are seduced to become the panegyrists of usurpation and tyranny.” He adds, “that even sedition is not the most indubitable enemy to the publick welfare; but that its most dreadful foe is despotism, which always changes the character of nations for the worse, and is productive of nothing but vice, that the tyrant no longer excites to the pursuits of glory or virtue; it is not talents, it is baseness and servility that he cherishes, and the weight of arbitrary power destroys the spring of emulation.”(a)2 If such is the influence of government on the character and manners, and undoubtedly the observation is just, must we not subscribe to the opinion of the celebrated Abbé Mablé? “That there are disagreeable seasons in the unhappy situation of human affairs, when policy requires both the intention and the power of doing mischief to be punished; and that when the senate proscribed the memory of Cæsar they ought to have put Anthony to death, and extinguished the hopes of Octavius.”3 Self defence is a primary law of nature, which no subsequent law of society can abolish; this primœval principle, the immediate gift of the Creator, obliges every one to remonstrate against the strides of ambition, and a wanton lust of domination, and to resist the first approaches of tyranny, which at this day threaten to sweep away the rights for which the brave sons of America have fought with an heroism scarcely paralleled even in ancient republicks. It may be repeated, they have purchased it with their blood, and have gloried in their independence with a dignity of spirit, which has made them the admiration of philosophy, the pride of America, and the wonder of Europe. It has been observed, with great propriety, that “the virtues and vices of a people when a revolution happens in their government, are the measure of the liberty or slavery they ought to expect–An heroic love for the publick good, a profound reverence for the laws, a contempt of riches, and a noble haughtiness of soul, are the only foundations of a free [276]government.”(b)4 Do not their dignified principles still exist among us? Or are they extinguished in the breasts of Americans, whose fields have been so recently crimsoned to repel the potent arm of a foreign Monarch, who had planted his engines of slavery in every city, with design to erase the vestiges of freedom in this his last asylum. It is yet to be hoped, for the honour of human nature, that no combinations either foreign or domestick have thus darkned this Western hemisphere.–On these shores freedom has planted her standard, diped in the purple tide that flowed from the veins of her martyred heroes; and here every uncorrupted American yet hopes to see it supported by the vigour, the justice, the wisdom and unanimity of the people, in spite of the deep-laid plots, the secret intrigues, or the bold effrontery of those interested and avaricious adventurers for place, who intoxicated with the ideas of distinction and preferment, have prostrated every worthy principle beneath the shrine of ambition. Yet these are the men who tell us republicanism is dwindled into theory–that we are incapable of enjoying our liberties–and that we must have a master.–Let us retrospect the days of our adversity, and recollect who were then our friends; do we find them among the sticklers for aristocratick authority? No, they were generally the same men who now wish to save us from the distractions of anarchy on the one hand, and the jaws of tyranny on the other; where then were the class who now come forth importunately urging that our political salvation depends on the adoption of a system at which freedom spurns?–Were not some of them hidden in the corners of obscurity, and others wrapping themselves in the bosom of our enemies for safety? Some of them were in the arms of infancy; and others speculating for fortune, by sporting with public money; while a few, a very few of them were magnanimously defending their country, and raising a character, which I pray heaven may never be sullied by aiding measures derogatory to their former exertions. But the revolutions in principle which time produces among mankind, frequently exhibits the most mortifying instances of human weakness; and this alone can account for the extraordinary appearance of a few names, once distinguished in the honourable walks of patriotism, but now found on the list of the Massachusetts assent to the ratification of a Constitution,5 which, by the undefined meaning of some parts, and the ambiguities of expression in others, is dangerously adapted to the purposes of an immediate aristocratic tyranny; that from the difficulty, if not impracticability of its operation, must soon terminate in the most uncontrouled despotism. All writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind witness the truth of these political axioms, that man is born free and possessed of certain unalienable rights–that government is instituted for the protection, safety, and happiness of the people, and not for the profit, honour, or private interest of any man, family, or class of men–That the origin of all power is in the people, and that they have an incontestible [277]right to check the creatures of their own creation, vested with certain powers to guard the life, liberty and property of the community: And if certain selected bodies of men, deputed on these principles, determine contrary to the wishes and expectations of their constituents, the people have an undoubted right to reject their decisions, to call for a revision of their conduct, to depute others in their room, or if they think proper, to demand further time for deliberation on matters of the greatest moment: it therefore is an unwarrantable stretch of authority or influence, if any methods are taken to preclude this reasonable, and peaceful mode of enquiry and decision. And it is with inexpressible anxiety, that many of the best friends to the Union of the States–to the peaceable and equal participation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity of this country, behold the insiduous arts, and the strenuous efforts of the partisans of arbitrary power, by their vague definitions of the best established truths, endeavoring to envelope the mind in darkness the concomitant of slavery, and to lock the strong chains of domestic despotism on a country, which by the most glorious and successful struggles is but newly emancipated from the sceptre of foreign dominion.–But there are certain seasons in the course of human affairs, when Genius, Virtue, and Patriotism, seems to nod over the vices of the times, and perhaps never more remarkably, than at the present period; or we should not see such a passive disposition prevail in some, who we must candidly suppose, have liberal and enlarged sentiments; while a supple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous homage to the opinions of those who by the most precipitate steps are treading down their dear bought privileges; and who are endeavouring by all the arts of insinuation, and influence, to betray the people of the United States, into an acceptance of a most complicated system of government; marked on the one side with the dark, secret and profound intrigues, of the statesman, long practised in the purlieus of despotism; and on the other, with the ideal projects of young ambition, with its wings just expanded to soar to a summit, which imagination has painted in such gawdy colours as to intoxicate the inexperienced votary, and send him rambling from State to State, to collect materials to construct the ladder of preferment. [1.] But as a variety of objections to the heterogeneous phantom, have been repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the best abilities and intentions; I will not expatiate long on a Republican form of government, founded on the principles of monarchy–a democratick branch with the features of aristocracy–and the extravagance of nobility pervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the poverty of peasantry hanging heavily on them, and insurmountable, from their taste for expence, unless a generous provision should be made in the arrangement of the civil list, which may enable them with the champions of their cause to “sail down the new pactolean channel.”6 Some gentlemen with laboured zeal, have spent much time in urging the necessity of government, from the embarrassments [278]of trade–the want of respectability abroad and confidence in the public engagements at home:–These are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few who do not unite in the general wish for the restoration of public faith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and industry, under a lenient, peaceable and energetick government: But the most sagacious advocates for the party have not by fair discusion, and rational argumentation, evinced the necessity of adopting this many–headed monster; of such motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace a feature of Democratick or Republican extract; nor have its friends the courage to denominate it a Monarchy, an Aristocracy, or an Oligarchy, and the favoured bantling must have passed through the short period of its existence without a name, had not Mr. Wilson, in the fertility of his genius, suggested the happy epithet of a Federal Republic.7–But I leave the field of general censure on the secrecy of its birth, the rapidity of its growth, and the fatal consequences of suffering it to live to the age of maturity, and will particularize some of the most weighty objections to its passing through this continent in a gigantic size.–It will be allowed by every one that the fundamental principle of a free government, is the equal representation of a free people–And I will first observe with a justly celebrated writer, “That the principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the absolute rights which were vested in them by the immediate laws of nature, but which could not be preserved in peace, without the mutual intercourse which is gained by the institution of friendly and social communities.”8 And when society has thus deputed a certain number of their equals to take care of their personal rights, and the interest of the whole community, it must be considered that responsibility is the great security of integrity and honour; and that annual election is the basis of responsibility.–Man is not immediately corrupted, but power without limitation, or amenability, may endanger the brightest virtue–whereas a frequent return to the bar of their Constituents is the strongest check against the corruptions to which men are liable, either from the intrigues of others of more subtle genius, or the propensities of their own hearts,–and the gentlemen who have so warmly advocated in the late Convention of the Massachusetts, the change from annual to biennial elections;9 may have been in the same predicament, and perhaps with the same views that Mr. Hutchinson once acknowledged himself, when in a letter to Lord Hillsborough, he observed, “that the grand difficulty of making a change in government against the general bent of the people had caused him to turn his thoughts to a variety of plans, in order to find one that might be executed in spite of opposition,” and the first he proposed was that, “instead of annual, the elections should be only once in three years:”10 but the Minister had not the hardiness to attempt such an innovation, even in the revision of colonial charters: nor has any one ever defended Beinnial, Triennial, or Septennial, Elections, either in the British House of Commons, or in the debates of Provincial assemblies, [279]on general and free principles: but it is unnecessary to dwell long on this article, as the best political writers have supported the principles of annual elections with a precision, that cannot be confuted, though they may be darkned, by the sophistical arguments that have been thrown out with design, to undermine all the barriers of freedom. 2. There is no security in the profered system, either for the rights of conscience, or the liberty of the Press: Despotism usually while it is gaining ground, will suffer men to think, say, or write what they please; but when once established, if it is thought necessary to subserve the purposes of arbitrary power, the most unjust restrictions may take place in the first instance, and an imprimator on the Press in the next, may silence the complaints, and forbid the most decent remonstrances of an injured and oppressed people. 3. There are no well defined limits of the Judiciary Powers, they seem to be left as a boundless ocean, that has broken over the chart of the Supreme Lawgiver “thus far shalt thou go and no further,”11 and as they cannot be comprehended by the clearest capacity, or the most sagacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to describe the dangers with which they are replete. 4. The Executive and the Legislative are so dangerously blended as to give just cause of alarm, and every thing relative thereto, is couched in such ambiguous terms–in such vague and indifinite expression, as is a sufficient ground without any other objection, for the reprobation of a system, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear investigation. 5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil causes.–This mode of trial the learned Judge Blackstone observes, “has been coeval with the first rudiments of civil government, that property, liberty and life, depend on maintaining in its legal force the constitutional trial by jury.” He bids his readers pauze, and with Sir Matthew Hale observes, how admirably this mode is adapted to the investigation of truth beyond any other the world can produce.12 Even the party who have been disposed to swallow, without examination, the proposals of the secret conclave, have started on a discovery that this essential right was curtailed; and shall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to our Saxon ancestors–that has been a part of the law of nations, even in the fewdatory systems of France, Germany and Italy–and from the earliest records has been held so sacred, both in ancient and modern Britain, that it could never be shaken by the introduction of Norman customs, or any other conquests or change of government–shall this inestimable privilege be relinquished in America–either thro’ the fear of inquisition for unaccounted thousands of public monies in the hands of some who have been officious in the fabrication of the consolidated system, or from the apprehension that some future delinquent possessed of more power than integrity, may be called to a trial by his peers in the hour of investigation? 6. Though it has been said by Mr. Wilson13 and many others, that a Standing–Army is necessary for the dignity and safety of America, yet freedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the Despot, may draw out his dragoons to suppress the murmurs of a few, who may yet cherish those sublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead to the best improvement of the human mind. It is hoped this country may yet be governed by milder methods than are usually displayed beneath the bannerets of military law.–Standing armies have been the nursery of vice and the bane of liberty from the Roman legions, to the establishment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cortes of Spain, to the planting the British cohorts in the capitals of America:–By the edicts of authority vested in the sovereign power by the proposed constitution, the militia of the country, the bulwark of defence, and the security of national liberty is no longer under the controul of civil authority; but at the rescript of the Monarch, or the aristocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous sums that will be necessary to support the civil list–to maintain the regalia of power–and the splendour of the most useless part of the community, or they may be sent into foreign countries for the fulfilment of treaties, stipulated by the President and two thirds of the Senate. 7. Notwithstanding the delusory promise to guarantee a Republican form of government to every State in the Union–If the most discerning eye could discover any meaning at all in the engagement, there are no resources left for the support of internal government, or the liquidation of the debts of the State. Every source of revenue is in the monopoly of Congress, and if the several legislatures in their enfebled state, should against their own feelings be necessitated to attempt a dry tax for the payment of their debts, and the support of internal police, even this may be required for the purposes of the general government. 8. As the new Congress are empowered to determine their own salaries, the requisitions for this purpose may not be very moderate, and the drain for public moneys will probably rise past all calculation: and it is to be feared when America has consolidated its despotism, the world will witness the truth of the assertion–“that the pomp of an eastern monarch may impose on the vulgar who may estimate the force of a nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wise man, judges differently, it is by that very magnificence he estimates its weakness. He sees nothing more in the midst of this imposing pomp, where the tyrant sets enthroned, than a sumptuous and mournful decoration of the dead; the apparatus of a fastuous funeral, in the centre of which is a cold and lifeless lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power ready to disappear before the enemy, by whom it is despised!” 9. There is no provision for a rotation, nor any thing to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of the best abilities [281]from their share in the offices of government.–By this neglect we lose the advantages of that check to the overbearing insolence of office, which by rendering him ineligible at certain periods, keeps the mind of man in equilibrio, and teaches him the feelings of the governed, and better qualifies him to govern in his turn. 10. The inhabitants of the United States, are liable to be draged from the vicinity of their own county, or state, to answer to the litigious or unjust suit of an adversary, on the most distant borders of the Continent: in short the appelate jurisdiction of the Supreme Federal Court, includes an unwarrantable stretch of power over the liberty, life, and property of the subject, through the wide Continent of America. 11. One Representative to thirty thousand inhabitants is a very inadequate representation; and every man who is not lost to all sense of freedom to his country, must reprobate the idea of Congress altering by law, or on any pretence whatever, interfering with any regulations for the time, places, and manner of choosing our own Representatives. 12. If the sovereignty of America is designed to be elective, the circumscribing the votes to only ten electors in this State, and the same proportion in all the others, is nearly tantamount to the exclusion of the voice of the people in the choice of their first magistrate. It is vesting the choice solely in an aristocratic junto, who may easily combine in each State to place at the head of the Union the most convenient instrument for despotic sway. 13. A Senate chosen for six years will, in most instances, be an appointment for life, as the influence of such a body over the minds of the people will be coequal to the extensive powers with which they are vested, and they will not only forget, but be forgotten by their constituents–a branch of the Supreme Legislature thus set beyond all responsibility is totally repugnant to every principle of a free government. 14. There is no provision by a bill of rights to guard against the dangerous encroachments of power in too many instances to be named: but I cannot pass over in silence the insecurity in which we are left with regard to warrants unsupported by evidence–the daring experiment of granting writs of assistance in a former arbitrary administration is not yet forgotten in the Massachusetts;14 nor can we be so ungrateful to the memory of the patriots who counteracted their operation, as so soon after their manly exertions to save us from such a detestable instrument of arbitrary power, to subject ourselves to the insolence of any petty revenue officer to enter our houses, search, insult, and seize at pleasure. We are told by a gentleman of too much virtue and real probity to suspect he has a design to deceive–“that the whole constitution is a declaration of rights”–but mankind must think for themselves, and to many very judicious and discerning characters, the whole constitution with very few exceptions appears a perversion of the rights of particular states, and of private citizens.–But the [282]gentleman goes on to tell us, “that the primary object is the general government, and that the rights of individuals are only incidentally mentioned, and that there was a clear impropriety in being very particular about them.”15 But, asking pardon for dissenting from such respectable authority, who has been led into several mistakes, more from his prediliction in favour of certain modes of government, than from a want of understanding or veracity. The rights of individuals ought to be the primary object of all government, and cannot be too securely guarded by the most explicit declarations in their favor. This has been the opinion of the Hampdens, the Pyms, and many other illustrious names, that have stood forth in defence of English liberties; and even the Italian master in politicks, the subtle and renouned Machiavel acknowledges, that no republic ever yet stood on a stable foundation without satisfying the common people.16 15. The difficulty, if not impracticability, of exercising the equal and equitable powers of government by a single legislature over an extent of territory that reaches from the Missisippi to the Western lakes, and from them to the Atlantic ocean, is an insuperable objection to the adoption of the new system.–Mr. Hutchinson, the great champion for arbitrary power, in the multitude of his machinations to subvert the liberties of this country, was obliged to acknowledge in one of his letters, that, “from the extent of country from north to south, the scheme of one government was impracticable.”17 But if the authors of the present visionary project, can by the arts of deception, precipitation and address, obtain a majority of suffrages in the conventions of the states to try the hazardous experiment, they may then make the same inglorious boast with this insidious politician, who may perhaps be their model, that “the union of the colonies was pretty well broken, and that he hoped never to see it renewed.”18 16. It is an indisputed fact, that not one legislature in the United States had the most distant idea when they first appointed members for a convention, entirely commercial, or when they afterwards authorised them to consider on some amendments of the Federal union, that they would without any warrant from their constituents, presume on so bold and daring a stride, as ultimately to destroy the state governments, and offer a consolidated system, irreversible but on conditions that the smallest degree of penetration must discover to be impracticable. 17. The first appearance of the article which declares the ratification of nine states sufficient for the establishment of the new system, wears the face of dissention, is a subversion of the union of the Confederated States, and tends to the introduction of anarchy and civil convulsions, and may be a means of involving the whole country in blood. 18. The mode in which this constitution is recommended to the people to judge without either the advice of Congress, or the legislatures of the several states, is very reprehensible–it is an attempt to force it upon them [283]before it could be thoroughly understood, and may leave us in that situation, that in the first moments of slavery the minds of the people agitated by the remembrance of their lost liberties, will be like the sea in a tempest, that sweeps down every mound of security. But it is needless to enumerate other instances, in which the proposed constitution appears contradictory to the first principles which ought to govern mankind; and it is equally so to enquire into the motives that induced to so bold a step as the annihilation of the independence and sovereignty of the thirteen distinct states.–They are but too obvious through the whole progress of the business, from the first shutting up the doors of the federal convention and resolving that no member should correspond with gentlemen in the different states on the subject under discussion; till the trivial proposition of recommending a few amendments was artfully ushered into the convention of the Massachusetts. The questions that were then before that honorable assembly were profound and important, they were of such magnitude and extent, that the consequences may run parallel with the existence of the country; and to see them waved and hastily terminated by a measure too absurd to require a serious refutation, raises the honest indignation of every true lover of his country. Nor are they less grieved that the ill policy and arbitrary disposition of some of the sons of America has thus precipitated to the contemplation and discussion of questions that no one could rationally suppose would have been agitated among us, till time had blotted out the principles on which the late revolution was grounded; or till the last traits of the many political tracts, which defended the seperation from Britain, and the rights of men were consigned to everlasting oblivion. After the severe conflicts this country has suffered, it is presumed that they are disposed to make every reasonable sacrifice before the altar of peace.–But when we contemplate the nature of men and consider them originally on an equal footing, subject to the same feelings, stimulated by the same passions, and recollecting the struggles they have recently made, for the security of their civil rights; it cannot be expected that the inhabitants of the Massachusetts, can be easily lulled into a fatal security, by the declamatory effusions of gentlemen, who, contrary to the experience of all ages would perswade them there is no danger to be apprehended, from vesting discretionary powers in the hands of man, which he may, or may not abuse. The very suggestion, that we ought to trust to the precarious hope of amendments and redress, after we have voluntarily fixed the shackles on our own necks should have awakened to a double degree of caution.–This people have not forgotten the artful insinuations of a former Governor, when pleading the unlimited authority of parliament before the legislature of the Massachusetts; nor that his arguments were very similar to some lately urged by gentlemen who boast of opposing his measure, “with halters about their necks.”19 We were then told by him, in all the soft language of insinuation, that no form of government of human construction can be perfect–that we had [284]nothing to fear–that we had no reason to complain–that we had only to acquiesce in their illegal claims, and to submit to the requisitions of parliament, and doubtless the lenient hand of government would redress all grievances, and remove the oppressions of the people:20–Yet we soon saw armies of mercenaries encamped on our plains–our commerce ruined–our harbours blockaded–and our cities burnt. It may be replied, that this was in consequence of an obstinate defence of our privileges; this may be true; and when the “ultima ratio” is called to aid, the weakest must fall. But let the best informed historian produce an instance when bodies of men were intrusted with power, and the proper checks relinquished, if they were ever found destitute of ingenuity sufficient to furnish pretences to abuse it. And the people at large are already sensible, that the liberties which America has claimed, which reason has justified, and which have been so gloriously defended by the sword of the brave; are not about to fall before the tyranny of foreign conquest: it is native usurpation that is shaking the foundations of peace, and spreading the sable curtain of despotism over the United States. The banners of freedom were erected in the wilds of America by our ancestors, while the wolf prowled for his prey on the one hand, and more savage man on the other; they have been since rescued from the invading hand of foreign power, by the valor and blood of their posterity; and there was reason to hope they would continue for ages to illumine a quarter of the globe, by nature kindly seperated from the proud monarchies of Europe, and the infernal darkness of Asiatic slavery.–And it is to be feared we shall soon see this country rushing into the extremes of confusion and violence, in consequence of the proceedings of a set of gentlemen, who disregarding the purposes of their appointment, have assumed powers unauthorised by any commission, have unnecessarily rejected the confederation of the United States, and annihilated the sovereignty and independence of the individual governments.–The causes which have inspired a few men assembled for very different purposes with such a degree of temerity as to break with a single stroke the union of America, and disseminate the seeds of discord through the land may be easily investigated, when we survey the pa[r]tizans of monarchy in the state conventions, urging the adoption of a mode of government that militates with the former professions and exertions of this country, and with all ideas of republicanism, and the equal rights of men. Passion, prejudice, and error, are characteristics of human nature; and as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philosophy, religion, or good policy; to these shades in the human character must be attributed the mad zeal of some, to precipitate to a blind adoption of the measures of the late federal convention, without giving opportunity for better information to those who are misled by influence or ignorance into erroneous opinions.–Litterary talents may be prostituted, and the powers of genius debased to subserve the purposes of ambition, or avarice; but the feelings of [285]the heart will dictate the language of truth, and the simplicity of her accents will proclaim the infamy of those, who betray the rights of the people, under the specious, and popular pretence of justice, consolidation, and dignity. It is presumed the great body of the people unite in sentiment with the writer of these observations, who most devoutly prays that public credit may rear her declining head, and remunerative justice pervade the land; nor is there a doubt if a free government is continued, that time and industry will enable both the public and private debtor to liquidate their arrearages in the most equitable manner. They wish to see the Confederated States bound together by the most indissoluble union, but without renouncing their seperate sovereignties and independence, and becoming tributaries to a consolidated fabrick of aristocratick tyranny.–They wish to see government established, and peaceably holding the reins with honour, energy, and dignity; but they wish for no federal city whose “cloud cap’t towers”21 may screen the state culprit from the hand of justice; while its exclusive jurisdiction may protect the riot of armies encamped within its limits.–They deprecate discord and civil convulsions, but they are not yet generally prepared with the ungrateful Israelites to ask a King, nor are their spirits sufficiently broken to yield the best of their olive grounds to his servants, and to see their sons appointed to run before his chariots22–It has been observed by a zealous advocate for the new system, that most governments are the result of fraud or violence, and this with design to recommend its acceptance23–but has not almost every step towards its fabrication been fraudulent in the extreme? Did not the prohibition strictly enjoined by the general Convention, that no member should make any communication to his Constituents, or to gentlemen of consideration and abilities in the other States, bear evident marks of fraudulent designs?–This circumstance is regretted in strong terms by Mr. Martin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges “He had no idea that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of the States was contained in that Convention, and that he wished to have corresponded with gentlemen of eminent political characters abroad, and to give their sentiments due weight”–he adds, “so extremely solicitous were they, that their proceedings should not transpire, that the members were prohibited from taking copies of their resolutions, or extracts from the Journals, without express permission, by vote.”24–And the hurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people, without giving time, by adjournments, for better information, and more unanimity has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to resistance, as the only alternative between that and servitude, till in the confusion of discord, the reins should be seized by the violence of some enterprizing genius, that may sweep down the last barrier of liberty, it must be added to the score of criminality with which the fraudulent usurpation at Philadelphia, may be chargeable.–Heaven avert such a tremendous [286]scene! and let us still hope a more happy termination of the present ferment:–may the people be calm, and wait a legal redress; may the mad transport of some of our infatuated capitals subside; and every influential character through the States, make the most prudent exertions for a new general Convention, who may vest adequate powers in Congress, for all national purposes, without annihilating the individual governments, and drawing blood from every pore by taxes, impositions and illegal restrictions.–This step might again re-establish the Union, restore tranquility to the ruffled mind of the inhabitants, and save America from distresses, dreadful even in contemplation.–“The great art of governing is to lay aside all prejudices and attachments to particular opinions, classes or individual characters; to consult the spirit of the people; to give way to it; and in so doing, to give it a turn capable of inspiring those sentiments, which may induce them to relish a change, which an alteration of circumstances may hereafter make necessary.”–The education of the advocates for monarchy should have taught them, and their memory should have suggested that “monarchy is a species of government fit only for a people too much corrupted by luxury, avarice, and a passion for pleasure, to have any love for their country, and whose vices the fear of punishment alone is able to restrain; but by no means calculated for a nation that is poor, and at the same time tenacious of their liberty–animated with a disgust to tyranny–and inspired with the generous feelings of patriotism and liberty, and at the same time, like the ancient Spartans have been hardened by temperance and manly exertions, and equally despising the fatigues of the field, and the fear of enemies,”–and while they change their ground they should recollect, that Aristocracy is still a more formidable foe to public virtue, and the prosperity of a nation–that under such a government her patriots become mercenaries–her soldiers, cowards, and the people slaves.–Though several State Conventions have assented to, and ratified, yet the voice of the people appears at present strong against the adoption of the Constitution.–By the chicanery, intrigue, and false colouring of those who plume themselves, more on their education and abilities, than their political, patriotic, or private virtues–by the imbecility of some, and the duplicity of others, a majority of the Convention of Massachusetts have been flattered with the ideas of amendments, when it will be too late to complain–While several very worthy characters, too timid for their situation, magnified the hopeless alternative, between the dissolution of the bands of all government, and receiving the proffered system in toto, after long endeavouring to reconcile it to their consciences, swallowed the indigestible penacea, and in a kind of sudden desperation lent their signature to the dereliction of the honorable station they held in the Union, and have broken over the solemn compact, by which they were bound to support their own excellent constitution till the period of revision.–Yet Virginia, equally large and respectable, and who have done honour to themselves, by their vigorous [287]exertions from the first dawn of independence, have not yet acted upon the question; they have wisely taken time to consider before they introduce innovations of a most dangerous nature:–her inhabitants are brave, her burgesses are free, and they have a Governor who dares to think for himself, and to speak his opinion (without first pouring libations on the altar of popularity) though it should militate with some of the most accomplished and illustrious characters.25 Maryland, who has no local interest to lead her to adopt, will doubtless reject the system–I hope the same characters still live, and that the same spirit which dictated to them a wise and cautious care, against sudden revolutions in government, and made them the last State that acceded to the independence of America, will lead them to support what they so deliberately claimed.–Georgia apprehensive of a war with the Savages, has acceded in order to insure protection.–Pennsylvania has struggled through much in the same manner, as the Massachusetts, against the manly feelings, and the masterly reasonings of a very respectable part of the Convention:26 They have adopted the system, and seen some of its authors burnt in effigy–their towns thrown into riot27 and confusion, and the minds of the people agitated by apprehension and discord. New-Jersey and Delaware have united in the measure, from the locality of their situation, and the selfish motives which too generally govern mankind; the Federal City, and the seat of government, will naturally attract the intercourse of strangers–the youth of enterprize, and the wealth of the nation to the central States. Connecticut has pushed it through with the precipitation of her neighbour, with few dissentient voices;–but more from irritation and resentment to a sister State, perhaps partiality to herself in her commercial regulations, than from a comprehensive view of the system, as a regard to the welfare of all.28–But New-York has motives, that will undoubtedly lead her to a rejection, without being afraid to appeal to the understanding of mankind, to justify the grounds of their refusal to adopt a Constitution, that even the framers dare not risque to the hazard of revision, amendment, or reconsideration, least the whole superstructure should be demolished by more skilful and discreet architects.–I know not what part the Carolinas will take; but I hope their determinations will comport with the dignity and freedom of this country–their decisions will have great weight in the scale.–But equally important are the small States of New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island:–New-York, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and these two lesser States may yet support the liberties of the Continent; if they refuse a ratification, or postpone their proceedings till the spirits of the community have time to cool, there is little doubt but the wise measure of another federal convention will be adopted, when the members would have the advantage of viewing, at large, through the medium of truth, the objections that have been made from various quarters; such a measure [288]might be attended with the most salutary effects, and prevent the dread consequences of civil feuds.–But even if some of those large states should hastily accede, yet we have frequently seen in the story of revolution, relief spring from a quarter least expected. Though the virtues of a Cato could not save Rome, nor the abilities of a Padilla defend the citizens of Castile from falling under the yoke of Charles; yet a Tell once suddenly rose from a little obscure city, and boldly rescued the liberties of his country.–Every age has its Bruti and its Decii, as well as its Caesars and Sejani:–The happiness of mankind depends much on the modes of government, and the virtues of the governors; and America may yet produce characters who have genius and capacity sufficient to form the manners and correct the morals of the people, and virtue enough to lead their country to freedom. Since her dismemberment from the British empire, America has, in many instances, resembled the conduct of a restless, vigorous, luxurious youth, prematurely emancipated from the authority of a parent, but without the experience necessary to direct him to act with dignity or discretion. Thus we have seen her break the shackles of foreign dominion, and all the blessings of peace restored on the most honourable terms: She acquired the liberty of framing her own laws, choosing her own magistrates, and adopting manners and modes of government the most favourable to the freedom and happiness of society. But how little have we availed ourselves of these superior advantages: The glorious fabric of liberty successfully reared with so much labour and assiduity totters to the foundation, and may be blown away as the bubble of fancy by the rude breath of military combinations, and politicians of yesterday. It is true this country lately armed in opposition to regal despotism–impoverished by the expences of a long war, and unable immediately to fulfil their public or private engagements, have appeared in some instances, with a boldness of spirit that seemed to set at defiance all authority, government, or order, on the one hand; while on the other, there has been, not only a secret wish, but an open avowal of the necessity of drawing the reins of government much too taught, not only for republicanism, but for a wise and limited monarchy.–But the character of this people is not averse to a degree of subordination: the truth of this appears from the easy restoration of tranquility, after a dangerous insurrection in one of the states; this also evinces the little necessity of a complete revolution of government throughout the union. But it is a republican principle that the majority should rule; and if a spirit of moderation could be cultivated on both sides, till the voice of the people at large could be fairly heard it should be held sacred.–And if, on such a scrutiny, the proposed constitution should appear repugnant to their character and wishes; if they, in the language of a late elegant pen, should acknowledge that “no confusion in my mind, is more terrible to them than the stern disciplined regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary governments, where every heart is depraved [289]by fear, where mankind dare not assume their natural characters, where the free spirit must crouch to the slave in office, where genius must repress her effusions, or like the Egyptian worshippers, offer them in sacrifice to the calves in power, and where the human mind, always in shackles, shrinks from every generous effort.” Who would then have the effrontery to say, it ought not to be thrown out with indignation, however some respectable names have appeared to support it.–But if after all, on a dispassionate and fair discussion, the people generally give their voice for a voluntary dereliction of their privileges, let every individual who chooses the active scenes of life, strive to support the peace and unanimity of his country, though every other blessing may expire–And while the statesman is plodding for power, and the courtier practising the arts of dissimulation without check–while the rapacious are growing rich by oppression, and fortune throwing her gifts into the lap of fools, let the sublimer characters, the philosophic lovers of freedom who have wept over her exit, retire to the calm shades of contemplation, there they may look down with pity on the inconsistency of human nature, the revolutions of states, the rise of kingdoms, and the fall of empires.

Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/5/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to The House of Assembly, continued. By the third section of the fourth article, no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State, without the consent of the legislature of such State. There are a number of States which are so circumstanced with respect to themselves and to the other States, that every principle of justice and sound policy, require their dismemberment or division into smaller States.—Massachusetts is divided into two districts, totally separated from each other by the State of New-Hampshire,—on the northeast side of which lies the provinces of Main and Sagadohock, more extensive in point of territory, but less populous than old Massachusetts, which lies on the other side of New-Hampshire.—No person can cast their eye on the map of that State but they must in a moment admit, that every argument drawn from convenience, interest, and justice require that the provinces of Main and Sagadohock should be erected into a new State, and that they should not be compelled to remain connected with old Massachusetts under all the inconveniences of their situation. The State of Georgia is larger in extent than the whole island of Great-Britain, extending from its sea coast to the Missisippi, a distance of eight hundred miles or more; its breadth for the most part, about three hundred miles.—The States of North-Carolina and Virginia in the same manner reach from the sea coast unto the Missisippi. The hardship, the inconvenience, and the injustice of compelling the inhabitants of those States who may dwell on the western side of the mountains and along the Ohio and Missisippi rivers to remain connected with the inhabitants of those States respectively, on the atlantic side of the mountains, and subject to the same State governments, would be such as would in my opinion, justify even recourse to arms to free themselves from and to shake off so ignominious a yoke. This representation was made in convention, and it was further urged that the territory of these States were too large, and that the inhabitants thereof would be too much disconnected for a republican government to extend to them its benefits, which is only suited to a small and compact territory—That a regard also for the peace and safety of the union, ought to excite a desire that those States should become in time divided into separate States, since when their population should become proportioned in any degree to their territory, they would from their strength [282]and power become dangerous members of a federal government.—It was further said that if the general government was not by its constitution to interfere, the inconvenience would soon remedy itself, for that as the population increased in those States, their legislatures would be obliged to consent to the erection of new States to avoid the evils of a civil war, but as by the proposed constitution the general government is obliged to protect each State against domestic violence, and consequently will be obliged to assist in suppressing such commotions and insurrections as may take place from the struggle to have new States erected, the general government ought to have a power to decide upon the propriety and necessity of establishing or erecting a new State even without the approbation of the legislature of such States, within whose jurisdiction the new State should be erected, and for this purpose I submitted to the convention the following proposition—“That on the application of the inhabitants of any district of territory within the limits of any of the States, it shall be lawful for the legislature of the United States, if they shall under all circumstances think it reasonable, to erect the same into a new State, and admit it into the union without the consent of the State of which the said district may be a part.”2 And it was said that we surely might trust the general government with this power with more propriety than with many others with which they were proposed to be entrusted—and that as the general government was bound to suppress all insurrections and commotions which might arise on this subject, it ought to be in the power of the general government to decide upon it, and not in the power of the legislature of a single State by obstinately and unreasonably opposing the erection of a new State to prevent its taking effect, and thereby extremely to oppress that part of its citizens which live remote from, and inconvenient to, the seat of its government, and even to involve the union in war to support its injustice and oppression.—But, upon the vote being taken, Georgia, South-Carolina, North-Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, were in the negative.—New-Hampshire, Connecticut, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, were in the affirmative.—New York was absent.3 That it was inconsistent with the rights of free and independent States, to have their territory dismembered without their consent, was the principal argument used by the opponents of this proposition.—The truth of the objection we readily admitted, but at the same time, insisted that it was not more inconsistent with the rights of free and independent States than that inequality of suffrage and power which the large States had extorted from the others; and that if the smaller States yielded up their rights in that instance, they were entitled to demand from the States of extensive territory a surrender of their rights in this instance; and in [283]a particular manner, as it was equally necessary for the true interest and happiness of the citizens of their own States, as of the union.—But, Sir, although when the large States demanded undue and improper sacrifices to be made to their pride and ambition, they treated the rights of free States with more contempt than ever a British parliament treated the rights of her colonial establishments, yet when a reasonable and necessary sacrifice was asked from them they spurned the idea with ineffable disdain. They then perfectly understood the full value and the sacred obligation of State rights, and at the least attempt to infringe them where they were concerned, they were tremblingly alive and agonized at every pore. When we reflect how obstinately those States contended for that unjust superiority of power in the government, which they have in part obtained, and for the establishment of this superiority by the constitution.—When we reflect that they appeared willing to hazard the existence of the union rather than not to succeed in their unjust attempt—That should their legislatures consent to the erection of new States within their jurisdiction, it would be an immediate sacrifice of that power, to obtain which they appeared disposed to sacrifice every other consideration. When we further reflect that they now have a motive for desiring to preserve their territory entire and unbroken, which they never had before—the gratification of their ambition in possessing and exercising superior power over their sister States—and that this constitution is to give them the means to effect this desire of which they were formerly destitute—the whole force of the United States pledged to them for restraining intestine commotions, and preserving to them the obedience and subjection of their citizens, even in the extremest part of their territory;—I say, Sir, when we consider these things it would be too absurd and improbable to deserve a serious answer, should any person suggest that these States mean ever to give their consent to the erection of new States within their territory.—Some of them it is true, have been for some time past amusing their inhabitants in those districts that wished to be erected into new States, but should this constitution be adopted, armed with a sword and halter to compel their obedience and subjection, they will no longer act with indecision;—and the State of Maryland may, and probably will be called upon to assist with her wealth and her blood in subduing the inhabitants of Franklin, Kentucky, Vermont, and the provinces of Main and Sagadohock, and in compelling them to continue in subjection to the States which respectively claim jurisdiction over them. Let it not be forgotten at the same time, that a great part of the territory of these large and extensive States, which they now hold in possession, and over which they now claim and exercise jurisdiction, [284]were crown lands, unlocated and unsettled when the American revolution took place—Lands which were acquired by the common blood and treasure, and which ought to have been the common stock, and for the common benefit of the Union.—Let it be remembered that the State of Maryland was so deeply sensible of the injustice that these lands should be held by particular States for their own emolument, even at a time when no superiority of authority or power was annexed to extensive territory, that in the midst of the late war and all the dangers which threatened us, it withheld for a long time its assent to the articles of confederation for that reason, and when it ratified those articles it entered a solemn protest against what it considered so flagrant injustice;4—But, Sir, the question is not now whether those States shall hold that territory unjustly to themselves, but whether by that act of injustice they shall have superiority of power and influence over the other States, and have a constitutional right to domineer and lord it over them—Nay, more, whether we will agree to a form of government by which we pledge to those States the whole force of the union to preserve to them that extensive territory entire and unbroken, and with our blood and wealth to assist them, whenever they please to demand it, to preserve the inhabitants thereof under their subjection, for the purpose of increasing their superiority over us—of gratifying their unjust ambition—in a word, for the purpose of giving ourselves masters, and of rivetting our chains! (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Agrippa,,Massachusetts Gazette,,2/5/1788,"To the Massachusetts Convention. GENTLEMEN, In my last address1 I ascertained, from historical records, the following principles, that, in the original state of government, the whole power resides in the whole body of the nation; that when a people appoint certain persons to govern them, they delegate their whole power; that a constitution is not itself a bill of rights; and that, whatever is the form of government, a bill of rights is essential to the security of the persons and property of the people. It is an idea favourable to the interest of mankind at large, that government is founded in compact. Several instances may be produced of it; but none is more remarkable than our own. In general I have chosen to apply to such facts as are in the reach of my readers. For this purpose I have chiefly confined myself to examples drawn from the history of our own country, and to the old testament. It is in the power of every reader to verify examples thus substantiated. Even in the remarkable argument on the fourth section, relative to the power over election, I was far from stating the worst of it, as it respects the adverse party. A gentleman, respectable in many points, but more especially for his systematick and perspicuous reasoning in his profession, has repeatedly stated to the Convention among his reasons in favour of that section, that the Rhode-Island assembly have for a considerable time past had a bill lying on their table for altering the manner of elections for representatives in that state.2 He has stated it with all the zeal of a person, who believed his argument to be a good one. But surely a bill lying on a table can never be considered as any more than an intention to pass it, and nobody pretends that it ever actually did pass. It is in strictness only the intention of a part of the assembly, for nobody can aver that it ever will pass.(a) I write not with an intention to deceive, but that the whole argument may be stated fairly. Much eloquence and ingenuity have been employed in shewing that side of the argument in favour of the proposed constitution; but it ought to be considered, that if we accept it upon mere verbal explanations, we shall find ourselves deceived. I appeal to the knowledge of every one, if it does not frequently happen, that a law is interpreted in practice very differently from the intention of the legislature. Hence arises the necessity of acts to amend and explain former acts. This is [864]not in inconvenience in the common and ordinary business of legislation; but is a great one in a constitution. A constitution is a legislative act of the whole people. It is an excellence that it should be permanent, otherwise we are exposed to perpetual insecurity from the fluctuation of government. We should be in the same situation as under absolute government, sometimes exposed to the pressure of greater, and sometimes unprotected by the weaker power in the sovereign. It is now generally understood, that it is for the security of the people, that the powers of the government should be lodged in different branches. By this means publick business will go on, when they all agree, and stop when they disagree. The advantage of checks in government is thus manifested, where the concurrence of different branches is necessary to the same act; but the advantage of a division of business is advantageous in other respects. As in every extensive empire, local laws are necessary to suit the different interests, no single legislature is adequate to the business. All human capacities are limitted to a narrow space; and as no individual is capable of practising a great variety of trades no single legislature is capable of managing all the variety of national and state concerns. Even if a legislature was capable of it, the business of the judicial department must, from the same cause, be slovenly done. Hence arises the necessity of a division of the business into national and local. Each department ought to have all the powers necessary for executing its own business, under such limitations as tend to secure us from any inequality in the operations of government. I know it is often asked against whom in a government by representation is a bill of rights to secure us? I answer, that such a government is indeed a government by ourselves; but as a just government protects all alike, it is necessary that the sober and industrious part of the community should be defended from the rapacity and violence of the vicious and idle. A bill of rights therefore ought to set forth the purposes for which the compact is made, and serves to secure the minority against the usurpation and tyranny of the majority. It is a just observation of his excellency doctor Adams in his learned defence of the American constitutions, that unbridled passions produce the same effect whether in a king, nobility, or a mob.3 The experience of all mankind has proved the prevalence of a disposition to use power wantonly. It is therefore as necessary to defend an individual against the majority in a republick, as against the king in a monarchy. Our state constitution has wisely guarded this point. The present confederation has also done it. I confess that I have yet seen no sufficient reason for not amending the confederation, though I have weighed the argument with candour. I think it would be much easier to amend it than the new constitution. [865]But this is a point on which men of very respectable character differ. There is another point in which nearly all agree, and that is, that the new constitution would be better in many respects if it had been differently framed. Here the question is not so much what the amendments ought to be, as in what manner they shall be made; whether they shall be made as conditions of our accepting the constitution, or whether we shall first accept it, and then try to amend it. I can hardly conceive that it should seriously be made a question. If the first question, whether we will receive it as it stands, be negatived, as it undoubtedly ought to be, while the conviction remains that amendments are necessary; the next question will be, what amendments shall be made? Here permit an individual, who glories in being a citizen of Massachusetts, and who is anxious that the character may remain undiminished. to propose such articles as appear to him necessary for preserving the rights of the state. He means not to retract any thing with regard to the expediency of amending the old confederation, and rejecting the new one totally; but only to make a proposition which he thinks comprehends the general idea of all parties. If the new constitution means no more than the friends of it acknowledge, they certainly can have no objection to affixing a declaration in favour of the rights of states and of citizens, especially as a majority of the states have not yet voted upon it.— “Resolved, that the constitution lately proposed for the United States be received only upon the following conditions: “1. Congress shall have no power to alter the time, place or manner of elections, nor any authority over elections, otherwise than by fining such state as shall neglect to send its representatives or senators, a sum not exceeding the expense of supporting its representatives or senators one year. “2. Congress shall not have the power of regulating the intercourse between the states, nor to levy any direct tax on polls or estates, nor any excise. “3. Congress shall not have power to try causes between a state and citizens of another state, nor between citizens of different states; nor to make any laws relative to the transfer of property between those parties, nor any other matter which shall originate in the body of any state. “4. It shall be left to every state to make and execute its own laws, except laws impairing contracts, which shall not be made at all. “5. Congress shall not incorporate any trading companies, nor alienate the territory of any state. And no treaty, ordinance or law of the United States shall be valid for these purposes. “6. Each state shall have the command of its own militia. “7. No continental army shall come within the limits of any state, other than garrison to guard the publick stores, without the consent of such states in time of peace. “8. The president shall be chosen annually and shall serve but one year, and shall be chosen successively from the different states, changing every year. “9. The judicial department shall be confined to cases in which ambassadours are concerned, to cases depending upon treaties, to offences committed upon the high seas, to the capture of prizes, and to cases in which a foreigner residing in some foreign country shall be a party and an American state or citizen shall be the other party; provider no suit shall be brought upon a state note. “10. Every state may emit bills of credit without making them a tender, and may coin money, of silver, gold or copper, according to the continental standard. “11. No powers shall be exercised by Congress or the president but such as are expressly given by this constitution and not excepted against by this declaration. And any office[r]s of the United States offending against an individual state shall be held accountable to such state as any other citizen would be. “12. No officer of Congress shall be free from arrest for debt by authority of the state in which the debt shall be due. “13. Nothing in this constitution shall deprive a citizen of any state of the benefit of the bill of rights established by the constitution of the state in which he shall reside, and such bills of rights shall be considered as valid in any court of the United States where they shall be pleased. “14. In all those causes which are triable before the continental courts, the trial by jury shall be held sacred.’ These at present, appear to me the most important points to be guarded. I have mentioned a reservation of excise to the separate states, because it is necessary, that they should have some way to discharge their own debts, and because it is placing them in an humiliating & disgraceful situation to depute them to transact the business of internal government without the means to carry it on. It is necessary also, as a check on the national government, for it has hardly been known that any government having the powers of war, peace, and revenue, has failed to engage in needless and wanton expense. A reservation of this kind is therefore necessary to preserve the importance of the state governments; without this the extremes of the empire will in a very short time sink into the same degradation and contempt with respect to the middle state[s] as Ireland, Scotland, & Wales, are in with regard [867]to England. All the men of genius and wealth will resort to the seat of government, that will be [the] center of revenue, and of business, which the extremes will be drained to supply. This is not mere vision, it is justified by the whole course of things. We shall therefore, if we neglect the present opportunity to secure ourselves, only encrease the number of proofs, already too many, that mankind are incapable of enjoying their liberty. I have been the more particular in stating the amendments to be made, because many gentlemen think it would be preferrable to receive the new system with corrections. I have by this means brought the corrections into one view, and shewn several of the principal points in which it is unguarded. As it is agreed, at least professedly, on all sides, that those rights should be guarded, it is among the inferiour questions in what manner it is done, provided it is absolutely and effectually done. For my own part, I am fully of opinion, that it would be best to reject this plan, and pass an explicit resolve, defining the powers of Congress to regulate the intercourse between us and foreign nations, under such restrictions as shall render their regulations equal in all parts of the empire. The impost, if well collected, would be fully equal to the interest of the foreign debt, and the current charges of the national government. It is evidently for our interest that the charges should be as small as possible. It is also for our interest that the western lands should, as fast as possible, be applied to the purpose of paying the home debt. Internal taxation and that fund have already paid two thirds of the whole debt, notwithstanding the embarrassments usual at the end of a war. We are now rising fast above our difficulties, every thing at home has the appearance of improvement, government is well established, manufactures increasing rapidly, and trade expanding. Till since the peace we never sent a ship to India, and the present year, it is said, sends above a dozen vessels from this state only, to the countries round the Indian ocean. Vast quantities of our’ produce are exported to those countries. It has been so much the practice of European nations to farm out this branch of trade, that we ought to be exceedingly jealous of our right. The manufactures of the state probably exceed in value one million pounds, for the last year. Most of the useful and some ornamental fabricks are established. There is great danger of these improvements being injured unless we practice extreme caution at setting out. It will always be for the interest of the southern states to raise a revenue from the more commercial ones. It is said that the consumer pays it; But does not a commercial state consume more foreign goods than a landed one? The people are more crouded, and of consequence the land is less able to support them. We know it is to be a favourite [868]system to raise the money where it is. But the money is to be expended at another place, and is therefore so much withdrawn annually from our stock. This is a single instance of the difference of interest; it would be very easy to produce others. Innumerable as the differences of manners, and these produce differences in the laws. Uniformity in legislation is of no more importance than in religion; Yet the framers of this new constitution did not even think it necessary that the president should believe, that there is a God, although they require an oath of him. It would be easy to shew the propriety of a general declaration upon that subject. But this paper is already extended too far. Another reason which I had in stating the amendments to be made, was to shew how nearly those who are for admitting the system with the necessary alterations, agree with those who are for rejecting this system and amending the confederation. In point of convenience, the confederation amended would be infinitely preferable to the proposed constitution. In amending the former, we know the powers granted, and are subject to no perplexity; but in reforming the latter, the business is excessively intricate, and great part of the checks on Congress are lost. It is to be remembered too, that if you are so far charmed with eloquence, and misled by fair representations and charitable constructions, as to adopt an undefined system, there will be no saying afterwards that you were mistaken, and wish to correct it. It will then be the constitution of our country, and entitled to defence. If Congress should chuse to avail themselves of a popular commotion to continue in being, as the fourth section justifies, and as the British parliament has repeatedly done the only answer will be, that it is the constitution of our country, and the people chose it. It is therefore necessary to be exceedingly critical. Whatsoever way shall be chosen to secure our rights, the same resolve ought to contain the whole system of amendment. If it is rejected, the resolve should contain the amendations of the old system; and accepted, it should contain the corrections of the new one. (a)A writer in the Gazette of 29th Jan. under the signature of captain M’Daniel having with civility and apparent candour, called for an explanation of what was said in one of my former papers, I have chosen to mention him with respect, as the only one of my reviewers who deserves an answer.4"
Newspaper,No,The Republican Federalist,,Massachusetts Centinel,,2/6/1788,"To the MEMBERS of the CONVENTION of Massachusetts. Honourable Friends, and Fellow Citizens, Let us, however, suppose the federal senate, in such a mighty squabble calling on their constituents, the State legislatures, for aid to impair or destroy the democratical federal branch. Is it possible that the members of any State senate or house, would “introduce such regulations, as would render the right of the people, insecure,” or “make an unequal and partial division of the State into districts,” or “disqualify one third of the electors,” as has been urged? Would the members from Worchester, or Hampshire, in either branch consent to regulations which would deprive their constituents of their suffrages and increase the privileges of the electors of Suffolk, or any other county? Could the members in either branch of the State legislature, ever have a motive to adopt such measures, as would deprive themselves as well as their constituents from influencing the elections of federal representatives? Will not the members of the State legislatures, as part of the collective body, be the constituents of the [870]federal representatives? Will not the State legislatures, being thus the constituents of both branches, be the only safe and proper umpire for preserving the harmony and ballance of the federal legislature? Will not the State legislatures knowing there can be no security for property under a rapacious aristocracy, leave out of the federal senate every member that shall aim at an undue controul of the house, and endeavour to produce by the people the same change of such federal representatives, as shall encroach on the rights of the senate? Surely they would; and is unnatural to suppose that the State legislatures can have any interest in aiding the federal senate to destroy the ballance of the federal legislature, or if they had, that the measure would be attempted; or if it was, that the people would need any other assistance, than their rights, under the State Constitutions to defeat the attempt. But let us suppose there is some danger of this evil, is it to be avoided by incur[r]ing one much greater? The federal senators, except two thirds of the first senate, will be always elected for six and the house for two years The members of both the federal branches from the duration and respectability of their appointments, and from their lucrative establishments, to be made by themselves, will have a great interest in their offices, and every motive to perpetuate them. This will be a common interest, and may, (as I think will evidently appear) be attained without even altering the form of the new Constitution, so excellently well adapted is it, to the establishment, of a baleful aristocracy. The federal legislature may, as has been shewn, and undoubtedly will, make the qualification of property so high, as that few in each State can be elected to either the senate or house: Whilst the revenue laws and other civil establishments in the executive and judicial departments of the union, will necessarily produce through the Continent, swarms of officers, who being nominated by the President, and appointed by and with the advice and consent of the senate, will be in their interest, and in the interest of the house likewise, as grants will be made by their joint concurrence. All the federal military officers will be appointed in the same manner, and be in the same interest—all the militia officers, through the continent, where appointment are by the new system, reserved to the States, will nevertheless, as the military officers under the present Confederation, be commissioned by the President of the United States, and attached to the congressional interest. All the late officers of the army who are a very reputable and influential body of men, and who are united by an institution, which gives them ten times the influence, they would otherwise have, will have the same attachment to federal government. How easy then, will it be with such support, for a body of such able men as [871]will compose Congress, to establish the elections of federal representatives at the metropolis as at any other place, in each state, and when this is effected, to collect the congressional or crown officers (as they soon will be called) at that place, and carry the elections for these senators and representatives who shall be in the aristocratical interest of the federal government, leaving out all honest republicans, who shall have been so vulgar as to have paid any regard to the interest of their constituents?"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/8/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, concluded. The part of the system, which provides that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States, was adopted by a very great majority of the convention, and without much debate,2—however, there were some members so unfashionable as to think that a belief of the existence of a Deity, and of a state of future rewards and punishments would be some security for the good conduct of our rulers, and that in a Christian country it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism. The seventh article declares, that the ratification of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the States ratifying the same. It was attempted to obtain a resolve that if seven States, whose votes in the first branch should amount to a majority of the representation [286]in that branch, concured in the adoption of the system, it should be sufficient, and this attempt was supported on the principle, that a majority ought to govern the minority;3—but to this it was objected that although it was true, after a constitution and form of government is agreed on, in every act done under and consistent with that constitution and form of government, the act of the majority, unless otherwise agreed in the constitution, should bind the minority, yet it was directly the reverse in originally forming a constitution, or dissolving it—That in originally forming a constitution, it was necessary that every individual should agree to it to become bound thereby—and that when once adopted it could not be dissolved by consent, unless with the consent of every individual who was party to the original agreement—That in forming our original federal government every member of that government, that is each State, expressly consented to it;—that it is a part of the compact made and entered into in the most solemn manner, that there should be no dissolution or alteration of that federal government without the consent of every State, the members of, and parties to the original compact; that therefore no alteration could be made by the consent of a part of the States, or by the consent of the inhabitants of a part of the States, which could either release the States so consenting from the obligation they are under to the other States, or which could in any manner become obligatory upon those States that should not ratify such alterations.—Satisfied of the truth of these positions, and not holding ourselves at liberty to violate the compact, which this State had solemnly entered into with the others, by altering it in a different manner from that which by the same compact is provided and stipulated, a number of the members and among those the delegation of this State opposed the ratification of this system in any other manner than by the unanimous consent and agreement of all the States. By our original articles of confederation any alterations proposed are in the first place to be approved by Congress.—Accordingly as the resolutions were originally adopted by the convention, and as they were reported by the committee of detail, it was proposed that this system should be laid before Congress for their approbation;—but, Sir, the warm advocates of this system fearing it would not meet with the approbation of Congress, and determined, even though Congress and the respective State legislatures should disapprove the same, to force it upon them, if possible, through the intervention of the people at large moved to strike out the words “for their approbation” and succeeded in their motion; to which, it being directly in violation of the mode prescribed by the articles of confederation for the alteration of our federal government, a part of the convention, and myself in the number, thought it a duty to give a decided negative.4 Agreeable to the articles of confederation entered into in the most solemn manner, and for the observance of which the States pledged themselves to each other, and called upon the Supreme Being as a witness and avenger between them, no alterations are to be made in those articles unless after they are approved by Congress, they are agreed to and ratified by the legislature of every State; but by the resolve of the convention this constitution is not to be ratified by the legislatures of the respective States, but is to be submitted to conventions chosen by the people, and if ratified by them is to be binding. This resolve was opposed among others by the delegation of Maryland;—your delegates were of opinion that as the form of government proposed was, if adopted, most essentially to alter the constitution of this State, and as our constitution had pointed out a mode by which, and by which only, alterations were to be made therein,5 a convention of the people could not be called to agree to and ratify the said form of government without a direct violation of our constitution, which it is the duty of every individual in this State to protect and support;—in this opinion all your delegates who were attending were unanimous—I, Sir, opposed it also upon a more extensive ground—as being directly contrary to the mode of altering our federal government established in our original compact, and as such being a direct violation of the mutual faith plighted by the States to each other, I gave it my negative.6 I also was of opinion that the States considered as States, in their political capacity, are the members of a federal government—That the States in their political capacity, or as sovereignties, are entitled, and only entitled originally to agree upon the form of, and submit themselves to, a federal government, and afterwards by mutual consent to dissolve or to alter it—That every thing which relates to the formation, the dissolution or the alteration of a federal government over States equally free, sovereign and independent is the peculiar province of the States in their sovereign or political capacity, in the same manner as what relates to forming alliances or treaties of peace, amity or commerce, and that the people at large in their individual capacity, have no more right to interfere in the one case than in the other—That according to these principles we originally acted in forming our confederation; it was the States as States, by their representatives in Congress, that formed the articles of confederation;—it was the States as States, by their legislatures, ratified those articles, and it was there established and provided that the States as States, that as by their legislatures, should agree to any alterations that should hereafter be proposed in the federal government, before they should be binding—and any alterations agreed to in any other manner cannot release the States from the obligation [288]they are under to each other by virtue of the original articles of confederation.—The people of the different States never made any objection to the manner the articles of confederation were formed or ratified, or to the mode by which alterations were to be made in that government—with the rights of their respective States they wished not to interfere—Nor do I believe the people in their individual capacity would ever have expected or desired to have been appealed to on the present occasion, in violation of the rights of their respective States, if the favourers of the proposed constitution, imagining they had a better chance of forcing it to be adopted by a hasty appeal to the people at large, who could not be so good judges of the dangerous consequences, had not insisted upon this mode—Nor do these positions in the least interfere with the principle, that all power originates from the people, because when once the people have exercised their power in establishing and forming themselves into a State government, it never devolves back to them, nor have they a right to resume or again to exercise that power until such events take place as will amount to a dissolution of their State government:—And it is an established principle that a dissolution or alteration of a federal government doth not dissolve the State governments which compose it.—It was also my opinion that upon principles of sound policy, the agreement or disagreement to the proposed system ought to have been by the State legislatures, in which case, let the event have been what it would, there would have been but little prospect of the public peace being disturbed thereby—Whereas the attempt to force down this system, although Congress and the respective State legislatures should disapprove, by appealing to the people, and to procure its establishment in a manner totally unconstitutional, has a tendency to set the State governments and their subjects at variance with each other—to lessen the obligations of government—to weaken the bands of society—to introduce anarchy and confusion—and to light the torch of discord and civil war throughout this continent.—All these considerations weighed with me most forcibly against giving my assent to the mode by which it is resolved this system is to be ratified, and were urged by me in opposition to the measure.7 I have now, Sir, in discharge of the duty I owe to this house, given such information as hath occured to me, which I consider most material for them to know; and you will easily perceive from this detail that a great portion of that time, which ought to have been devoted calmly and impartially to consider what alterations in our federal government would be most likely to procure and preserve the happiness of the union, was employed in a violent struggle on the one side to obtain all power and dominion in their own hands, and on the other to prevent [289]it—and that the aggrandizement of particular States and particular individuals appears to have been much more the object sought after than the welfare of our country. The interest of this State, not confined merely to itself, abstracted from all others, but considered relatively; and as far as was consistent with the common interest of the other States, I thought it my duty to pursue according to the best opinion I could form of it. When I took my seat in the convention, I found them attempting to bring forward a system, which I was sure never had entered into the contemplation of those I had the honour to represent, and which upon the fullest consideration, I considered not only injurious to the interest and the rights of this State, but also incompatible with the political happiness and freedom of the States in general; from that time until my business compelled me to leave the convention, I gave it every possible opposition in every stage of its progression.—I opposed the system there with the same explicit frankness with which I have here given you a history of our proceedings, and an account of my own conduct, which in a particular manner I consider you as having a right to know—While there, I endeavoured to act as became a free man, and the delegate of a free State. Should my conduct obtain the approbation of those who appointed me, I will not deny it would afford me satisfaction; but to me that approbation was at most no more than a secondary consideration—my first was to deserve it;—left to myself to act according to the best of my discretion, my conduct should have been the same, had I been even sure your censure would have been my only reward, since I hold it sacredly my duty to dash the cup of poison, if possible, from the hand of a State or an individual, however anxious the one or the other might be to swallow it. Indulge me, Sir, in a single observation further. There are persons who endeavour to hold up the idea that this system is only opposed by the officers of government—I, Sir, am in that predicament.—I have the honor to hold an appointment in this State.8 Had it been considered any objection, I presume I should not have been appointed to the convention—If it could have any effect on my mind, it would only be that of warming my heart with gratitude, and rendering me more anxious to promote the true interest of that State which has conferred upon me the obligation, and to heighten my guilt had I joined in sacrificing its essential rights—But, Sir, it would be well to remember, that this system is not calculated to diminish the number or the value of offices—on the contrary, if adopted, it will be productive of an enormous increase in their number—many of them will be also of great honour and emolument. Whether, Sir, in this variety of appointments and in [290]the scramble for them, I might not have as good a prospect to advantage myself as many others is not for me to say—but this, Sir, I can say with truth, that so far was I from being influenced in my conduct by interest, or the consideration of office, that I would cheerfully resign the appointment I now hold—I would bind myself never to accept another either under the general government or that of my own State—I would do more, Sir, so destructive do I consider the present system to the happiness of my country, I would cheerfully sacrifice that share of property with which Heaven has blessed a life of industry,—I would reduce myself to indigence and poverty; and those who are dearer to me than my own existence I would entrust to the care and protection of that Providence who hath so kindly protected myself, if on those terms only I could procure my country to reject those chains which are forged for it."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/20/1788,"To the free people of Virginia. Countrymen and Fellow-Citizens, That the subject, which has given rise to the following observations, is of the highest consequence to this country, requires not the aid of logical proof; that it merits the most serious attention of every member of this community, is a fact not to be controverted. Will not a bare mention of the new Federal Constitution justify this remark? To foreigners or such, whose local connections form no permanent interest in America, this may be totally indifferent; and to them it may afford mere matter of speculation and private amusement. When such advert to the high and distinguished characters, who have drawn up, and proposed a set of articles to the people of an extensive continent as a form of their future government, an emotion of curiosity may induce them to examine the contents of those articles: and they may, perhaps, from having contemplated on a former situation of those people—that they had struggled against a potent enemy—that they had by their virtuous and patriotic exertions rescued themselves from impending danger—that they had used the like endeavors to establish for themselves a system of government upon free and liberal principles—that they had in pursuance of those endeavors [388]chosen a system, as conducive to the great ends of human happiness, the preservation of their natural rights and liberties—that this system has prevailed but a few years; and now already a change, a fundamental change therein is meditated:—strangers, I say, having contemplated on these circumstances, may be led to consider this nation, as a restless and dissatisfied people, whose fickle inconsistent minds suffer them not to abide long in the same situation; who perpetually seeking after new things throw away one blessing in pursuit of another: and while they are thus indulging their caprice—lose all, ere any can ripen into maturity. If the unconcerned part of those among us entertain themselves in this manner, can any good American be content to deserve such reflections? Will not all rather feel an honest indignation, if they once perceive their country stamped with a character like this? And yet, may we not justify such conceptions, if we thus precipitate ourselves into a new government before we have sufficiently tried the virtues of the old? So incident is error to the human mind, that it is not to be wondered at indeed, if our present Constitution is incomplete. The best regulated governments have their defects, and might perhaps admit of improvement: but the great difficulty consists in clearly discovering the most exceptionable parts and judiciously applying the amendments. A wise nation will, therefore, attempt innovations of this kind with much circumspection. They will view the political fabric, which they have once reared, as the sacred palladium of their happiness;—they will touch it, as a man of tender sensibility toucheth the apple of his eye,—they will touch it with a light, with a trembling—with a cautious hand,—lest they injure the whole structure in endeavoring to reform any of its parts. In small and trivial points alterations may be attempted with less danger; but—where the very nature, the essence of the thing is to be changed: when the foundation itself is to be transformed, and the whole plan entirely new modelled;—should you not hesitate, O Americans? Should you not pause—and reflect a while on the important step, you are about to take? Does it not behove you to examine well into the nature and tendency of the Constitution now proposed for your adoption? And by comparing it with your present mode of government, endeavor to distinguish which of the two is most eligible? Whether this or that is best calculated for promoting your happiness? for obtaining and securing those benefits, which are the great object of civil society? Will it be consistent with the duty, which you owe to yourselves, as a nation, or with the affection, which you ought to bear for your posterity, if you rashly or inconsiderately adopt a measure, which is to influence the fate of this country for ages yet to come? How will it accord with your dignity and reputation, [389]as an independent people, if either through an over-weaning fondness for novelty you are suddenly transported on the wings of imagination, and too hastily make up your thoughts on this great subject; or by sinking into a listless inactivity of mind, view it as an indifferent matter unworthy of any deliberate consideration? Will any respect? Will any honor? Will any veneration be due to the memory of yourselves, as ancestors, if millions of beings, who have not yet received their birth, when you are all mouldered into dust, should find themselves fixed in a miserable condition by one injudicious determination of your’s at this period? If you see no impropriety in these questions, the suggestions contained in them will not appear altogether unworthy of attention. One moment’s reflection, it is humbly presumed, will render it obvious that on this occasion they are not impertinently propounded. In pursuing this address I beg leave to premise that the only true point of distinction between arbitrary and free governments seems to be, that in the former the governors are invested with powers of acting according to their own wills, without any other limits than what they themselves may understand to be necessary for the general good; whereas in the latter they are intrusted with no such unlimited authority, but are restrained in their operations to conform to certain fundamental principles, the preservation whereof is expressly stipulated for in the civil compact: and whatever is not so stipulated for is virtually and impliedly given up. Societies so constituted invest their supreme governors with ample powers of exerting themselves according to their own judgment in every thing not inconsistent with or derogatory to those principles; and so long as they adhere to such restrictions, their deeds ought not to be rescinded or controuled by any other power whatsoever. Those principles are certain inherent rights pertaining to all mankind in a state of natural liberty, which through the weakness, imperfection, and depravity of human nature cannot be secured in that state. Men, therefore, agree to enter into society, that by the united force of many the rights of each individual may be protected and secured. These are in all just governments laid down as a foundation to the civil compact, which contains a covenant between each with all, that they shall enter into one society to be governed by the same powers; establishes for that purpose the frame of government; and consequently creates a Convention between every member, binding those, who shall at any time be intrusted with power, to a faithful administration of their trust according to the form of the civil policy, which they have so constituted, and obliging all to a due obedience therein. There can be no other just origin of civil power, [390]but some such mutual contract of all the people: and although their great object in forming society is an intention to secure their natural rights; yet the relations arising from this political union create certain duties and obligations to the state, which require a sacrifice of some portion of those rights and of that exuberance of liberty, which obtains in a state of nature.—This, however, being compensated by certain other adventitious rights and privileges, which are acquired by the social connection; it follows that the advantages derived from a government are to be estimated by the strength of the security, which is attended at once with the least sacrifice and the greatest acquired benefits. That government, therefore, which is best adapted for promoting these three great ends, must certainly be the best constituted scheme of civil policy. Here, then, it may not be improper to remark that persons forming a social community cannot take too much precaution when they are about to establish the plan of their government. They ought to construct it in such a manner as to procure the best possible security for their rights;—in doing this they ought to give up no greater share than what is understood to be absolutely necessary:—and they should endeavor so to organise, arrange and connect it’s several branches, that when duly exercised it may tend to promote the common good of all, and contribute as many advantages, as the civil institution is capable of. It has been before observed that the only just origin of civil power is a contract entered into by all the people for that purpose.—If this position be true (and, I dare presume, it is not controverted, at least in this country) right reason will always suggest the expediency of adhering to the essential requisites in forming that contract upon true principles. A cautious people will consider all the inducements to enter into the social state, from the most important object down to the minutest prospect of advantage. Every motive with them will have its due weight. They will not pay a curious attention to trifles and overlook matters of great consequence:—and in pursuing these steps they will provide for the attainment of each point in view with a care—with an earnestness proportionate to its dignity, and according as it involves a greater or a lesser interest. It is evident, therefore that they should attend most diligently to those sacred rights, which they have received with their birth, and which can neither be retained to themselves, nor transmitted to their posterity, unless they are expressly reserved: for it is a maxim, I dare say, universally acknowledged, that when men establish a system of government, in granting the powers therein they are always understood to surrender whatever they do not so expressly reserve. This is obvious from the very design of the civil institution, which is adopted in lieu of the state of natural liberty, wherein each [391]individual, being equally intitled to the enjoyment of all natural rights, and having equally a just authority to exercise full powers of acting, with relation to other individuals, in any manner not injurious to their rights, must, when he enters into society, be presumed to give up all those powers into the hands of the state by submitting his whole conduct to the direction thereof. This being done by every member, it follows, as a regular conclusion, that all such powers, whereof the whole were possessed, so far as they related to each other individually, are of course given up by the mere act of union. If this surrender be made without any reservation, the conclusion is equally plain and regular, that each and all have given up not only those powers, which relate to others, but likewise every claim, which pertained to themselves, as individuals. For the universality of the grant in this case must necessarily include every power of acting, and every claim of possessing or obtaining any thing—except according to the regulations of the state. Now a right being properly defined, “a power or claim established by law, to act, or to possess, or to obtain something from others,” every natural right is such power or claim established by the law of nature. Thus, it is manifest, that in a society constituted after this manner, every right whatsoever will be under the power and controul of the civil jurisdiction. This is the leading characteristic of an arbitrary government, and whenever any people establish a system like this, they subject themselves to one, which has not a single property of a free constitution. Hence results the necessity of an express stipulation for all such rights as are intended to be exempted from the civil authority. Permit me now, my country men, to make a few observations on the proposed Federal Constitution. In this attempt the subject, as it is arduous and difficult, naturally impresses the modest mind with diffidence: yet being of the last importance, as involving in it the highest interest, that freemen can have—all that is dear and valuable to the citizens of these United States; a consciousness of the strong claim, which this subject has, to a free and general discussion, has prevailed over that discouraging idea so far as to produce the present address to you. This is done with a reliance on that benevolence and liberality of sentiment, with which you have hitherto been actuated. From these benign qualities, it is hoped, the most favorable indulgence will be granted, and that the zeal, with which this is written, will be allowed in some measure an excuse for its defects. However imperfect, therefore this may be, however inadequate to your own ideas, or to the wishes of him, who offers it to your consideration; you are hereby intreated to let the perusal, with which you may think proper to favor [392]it, be serious, candid, dispassionate—as it relates to a common cause, in which all are alike concerned. Suffer me, then, in the first place to advert to a part of the sixth article in this constitution. It may, perhaps, appear somewhat irregular, to begin with this article, since it is almost the last proposed: yet, if it be considered that this at once defines the extent of Congressional authority, and indisputably fixes its supremacy, every idea of impropriety on this head will probably vanish. The clause alluded to contains the following words, “This constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary, notwithstanding.” If this constitution should be adopted, here the sovereignty of America is ascertained and fixed in the federal body at the same time that it abolishes the present independent sovereignty of each state. Because this government being general, and not confined to any particular part of the continent; but pervading every state and establishing its authority equally in all, its superiority will consequently be recognized in each; and all other powers can operate only in a secondary subordinate degree. For the idea of two sovereignties existing within the same community is a perfect solecism. If they be supposed equal, their operation must be commensurate, and like two mechanical powers of equal momenta counteracting each other;—here the force of the one will be destroyed by the force of the other: and so there will be no efficiency in either. If one be greater than the other, they will be similar to two unequal bodies in motion with a given degree of velocity, and impinging each other from opposite points;—the motion of the lesser in this case will necessarily be destroyed by that of the greater: and so there will be efficiency only in the greater. But what need is there for a mathematical deduction to shew the impropriety of two such distinct co-existing sovereignties? The natural understanding of all mankind perceives the apparent absurdity arising from such a supposition: since, if the word means anything at all, it must mean that supreme power, which must reside somewhere instate; or, in other terms, it is the united powers of each individual member of the state collected and consolidated into one body. This collection, this union, this supremacy of power can, therefore, exist only in one body. This is obvious to every man: and it has been very properly suggested that under the proposed constitution each state will dwindle into “the insignificance of a town corporate.” This certainly will be their utmost consequence; and, as such, they will have [393]no authority to make laws, even for their own private government any farther than the permissive indulgence of Congress may grant them leave. This, Virginians, will be your mighty, your enviable situation after all your struggles for independence! and, if you will take the trouble to examine, you will find that the great, the supereminent authority, with which this instrument of union proposes to invest the federal body, is to be created without a single check—without a single article of covenant for the preservation of those inestimable rights, which have in all ages been the glory of freemen. It is true, “the United States shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government:” yet they do not guarantee to the different states their present forms of government, or the bill of rights thereto annexed, or any of them; and the expressions are too vague, too indefinite to create such a compact by implication. It is possible that a “republican form” of government may be built upon as absolute principles of despotism as any oriental monarchy ever yet possessed. I presume that the liberty of a nation depends, not on planning the frame of government, which consists merely in fixing and delineating the powers thereof; but on prescribing due limits to those powers, and establishing them upon just principles. It has been held in a northern state by a zealous advocate for this constitution that there is no necessity for “a bill of rights” in the federal government; although at the same time he acknowledges such necessity to have existed when the constitutions of the separate governments were established. He confesses that in these instances the people “invested the[i]r representatives with every power and authority, which they did not in explicit terms reserve:” but “in delegating federal powers,” says he, “every thing, which is not given, is reserved.”2 Here is a distinction, I humbly conceive, without a difference, at least in the present enquiry. How far such a discrimination might prevail with respect to the present system of union, it is immaterial to examine; and had the observation been restrained to that alone, perhaps it might be acknowledged to contain some degree of propriety. For under the confederation it is well known that the authority of Congress cannot extend so far as to interfere with, or exercise any kind of coercion on, the powers of legislation in the different states; but the internal police of each is left free, sovereign and independent: so that the liberties of the people being secured as well as the nature of their constitution will admit; and the declaration of rights, which they have laid down as the basis of government, having their full force and energy, any farther stipulation on that head might be unnecessary. But, surely, when this doctrine comes to be applied to the proposed [394]federal constitution, which is framed with such large and extensive powers, as to transfer the individual sovereignty from each state to the aggregate body,—a constitution, which delegates to Congress an authority to interfere with, and restrain the legislatures of every state—invests them with supreme powers of legislation throughout all the states—annihilates the separate independency of each; and, in short—swallows up and involves in the plenitude of its jurisdiction all other powers whatsoever:—I shall not be taxed with arrogance in declaring such an argument to be fallacious; and insisting on the necessity of a positive unequivocal declaration in favor of the rights of freemen in this case even more strongly than in the case of their separate governments. For it seems to me that when any civil establishment is formed, the more general its influence, the more extensive the powers, with which it is invested, the greater reason there is to take the necessary precaution for securing a due administration, and guarding against unwarrantable abuses."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,James Gordon Jr.,,,2/26/1788,"Captain Merry delivered me the letter that you were pleased to write me, on the 11th instant,2 in which I find you propose the following questions, relative to the new constitution, proposed by the late general convention, and request my answer to them: First. Whether the United States had not better receive than reject the said constitution? Secondly. Whether it would not injure our credit in the European world, if we were to dissent therefrom; and whether our country would not thereby be endangered, as there are large demands in Europe against us? Thirdly. Whether every objection to the plan may not, by instructions from the different states, be made as soon as the said Congress may be assembled? Fourthly. Whether ruin would await us, unless we are consolidated in one general plan of government? To the first question, namely, “Whether the United States,” &c. I answer, that this question implies a necessity of either adopting or rejecting. But I know of no power on earth that has, or ever had, a right to propose such a question of extremity to the people, or any part of the people, of the United States. The happiness or misery of mankind depends so essentially upon government, that, when this is to be established by the people for themselves and their posterity, the right of the people cannot be questioned, of so acting with plans proposed, as to adopt them, reject them, or propose amendments to them. To the second query, “Whether it would not injure,” &c. I reply, that this second question is much founded on the first; and, so far as it is, may receive the same answer. It is divisible into two parts; the first, shall our credit be injured in Europe by dissenting from the proposed plan? It is presumable, that credit abroad depends much upon union and happiness at home, as it must always greatly do upon that industry and real strength which grows out of the possession of civil liberty. Those, therefore, who contend for the new plan, by propounding such a question, should prove, in the first place, that the adoption of this constitution will secure union and happiness at home, and those valuable consequences that flow from the possession of civil liberty; and this is the more necessary, as there are such numbers who think that the proffered plan, if admitted without amendments, will empower the administrators of the new government to destroy civil liberty. The second part of this question is, [“]whether our country will not be endangered by a dissent, as there are large demands against us in Europe.” I presume that foreigners have no business with the nature of our government. Payment of their debts they are entitled to, but no possible reason can be assigned, why these debts may not as well be paid if the proposed constitution was to be so amended, as to secure the just rights and liberties of the people from violation, by a proper [419]bill of rights; to retain the trial by jury in all cases, civil as well as criminal, as directed by the common law; to secure the rights of conscience, and freedom of the press. Will France, Holland, or Spain, be disturbed at our retaining these valuable privileges? or, will they quarrel with us for so amending this new plan, as to put it out of the power of the new rulers to carry every citizen of the state, by way of appeal, to be tried for every suit for debt, brought by all others than our own state citizens, in the supreme federal court, where distance and expense may ruin multitudes? Have foreigners any thing to do with our amending the proposed constitution, so as to put it out of the power of the rulers under it, to garble elections, by ordering all the elections of any state to be held at any place they shall choose—at Cape Henry,3 for instance, if they so please at any time. See section fourth, article first, where they have power over time, place, and manner of holding elections for choosing representatives, without restraint or limitation. To the third query, “Whether every objection,” &c. I answer, that the constitution containing these objections, is made by the people of the United States; “and the removal of them by the Congress, would only be a common act of legislation, which may be revoked and repealed by every subsequent meeting of the Congress.[”] So that the power of oppressing will be founded on the strong and lasting ground of a constitution made by the people of the United States, and the remedies (if the new rulers should ever please to declare any,) will rest on feeble and changeable acts of a common legislature. Can it be safe or prudent to suffer this? As for instructions, it is to be remarked, that the senators are chosen by the legislature of the states, and the representatives by all the freeholders—to instruct one, and not both branches of the new legislature, would be doing nothing; and to render instructions of use, the general assembly, and the freeholders of the community, must unite. The almost impossibility of procuring such a union from the majority of the United States, is too obvious, not to show the very little dependence that should be put on such instructions. And, after all, the result could only be a legislative and mutable act against a fixed constitution. But how absurd would it be for the people to agree to a constitutional evil to-day and to-morrow call for a legislative redress of that evil! The fourth and last question, “Whether ruin would await us,” &c. I am clearly of opinion, that our greater strength, safety, and happiness, depends on our union; but I am as clear that this union had infinitely better be on principles that give security to the just rights and liberties of mankind, than on such principles as permit rulers to [420]destroy them. Thus, sir, I hope that I have fully, and to your satisfaction, answered your several questions: so that you may think yourself warranted, if not bound to be a friend to amendments that should be constitutional. To trust to future events for remedy of evils that we have ourselves once created, is like choosing to be sick, because a doctor may possibly cure us! A very capital defect in this new project is, that the executive and legislative powers are so blended and united, as to remove all chance for responsibility; and to possess man with very great powers, without making him easily answerable for an abuse of these powers, is, in my opinion, neither safe nor wise. I am glad to hear that Colonel Barbour4 stands for the convention. It is many years ago since I saw his conduct in the legislature, and observed it to be both sensible and honest. I have been obliged to write in haste, so that you may be sure this letter is not intended for the press."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,2/27/1788,"(Continued from our last.) Section 8th of the first article gives the Congress a power “to lay and collect, taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” If it be a true maxim that those, who are entrusted with the exercise of the higher powers of government, ought to observe two essential rules; first in having no other view than the general good of all without any regard to private interest; and secondly, to take equal care of the whole body of the community, so as not to favor one part more than another: it is apparent that under the proposed constitution, this general confederated society, made up of thirteen different states, will have very little security for obtaining an observance, either of the one, or of the other, rule. For being different societies, though blended together in legislation, and having as different interests; no uniform rule for the whole seems to be practicable: and hence, it is to be feared, that the general good may be lost in a mutual attention to private views. From the same causes we may lament the probability of losing the advantage of the second rule; for it may be expected, in like manner, that the general [421]care of the whole will be lost by the separate endeavors of different legislators to favor their own states. So long as mankind continues to be influenced by interest, the surest means of effecting an union of counsels in any assembly is by an union of interests. Now, if it be considered that it is this concert, that it is this union in promoting the general good, which alone can preserve concord in this great republic, and secure it success and glory,—unhappy will be the situation of America, if she once precludes the beneficial effects of such a good understanding. Yet, I apprehend that these evils may result in a great measure from an exercise of that branch of legislative authority, which respects internal direct taxation. For in this, it is scarcely probable that the interest, ease or convenience of the several states can be so well consulted in the federal assembly, as in their own respective legislatures. So different are many species of property, so various the productions, so unequal the profits arising, even from the same species of property, in different states, that no general mode of contribution can well be adopted in such a manner as at once to affect all in an equitable degree. Hence may arise disagreeable objects of contention. A diversity of interests will produce a diversity of schemes. Thus each state, as it is natural will endeavor to raise a revenue by such means, as may appear least injurious to its own interest: a source of dissention manifestly detrimental to that harmony, which is necessary to support the confederation. I cannot conceive it impracticable to reform the federal system in such a manner as to ensure a compliance with the necessary requisitions of Congress from the different state legislatures. Then all the several states being left to raise their own share of the revenue, and being the only proper judges of the mode most convenient to themselves, it is highly probable that this important branch of government would be carried on more generally to the satisfaction of each state; and would tend to promote a spirit of concord between all the parts of this great community. Because each being thus accommodated, and participating [in] the advantages of the union,—none subjected to any inconvenience thereby,—all would consequently concur in nourishing an affection for the government, which so cemented them. I believe, it is acknowledged that the establishment of excises has been one of the greatest grievances, under which the English nation has labored for almost a century and an half. Although this may seem an economical tax, as arising out of manufactures, from which the industrious may derive advantages; and whereof the wealthy by consuming the greatest share, will of course contribute the largest proportion of the tax: yet the nature of it being such, as requires severe laws for [422]its execution, it has justly become an object of general detestation. This has induced Judge Blackstone to declare that “the rigour and arbitrary proceedings of excise laws seem hardly compatible with the temper of a free nation.”2 While, therefore, you are freemen—while you are unused to feel any other power, but such as can be exercised within the bounds of moderation and decency, it, doubtless, behoves you to consider whether it is an eligible step to subject yourselves to a new species of authority, which may warrant the most flagrant violations of the sacred rights of habitation. If this branch of revenue takes place, all the consequent rigour of excise laws will necessarily be introduced in order to enforce a due collection. On any charges of offence in this instance you will see yourselves deprived of your boasted trial by jury. The much admired common law process will give way to some quick and summary mode, by which the unhappy defendant will find himself reduced, perhaps to ruin, in less time than a charge could be exhibited against him in the usual course. It has ever been held that standing armies in times of peace are dangerous to a free country; and no observation seems to contain more reason in it. Besides being useless, as having no object of employment, they are inconvenient and expensive. The soldiery, who are generally composed of the dregs of the people, when disbanded, or unfit for military service, being equally unfit for any other employment, become extremely burthensome. As they are a body of men exempt from the common occupations of social life, having an interest different from the rest of the community, they [are] wanton in the lap of ease and indolence, without feeling the duties, which arise from the political connection, though drawing their subsistence from the bosom of the state. The severity of discipline necessary to be observed reduces them to a degree of slavery; the unconditional submission to the commands of their superiors, to which they are bound, renders them the fit instruments of tyranny and oppression.—Hence they have in all ages afforded striking examples of contributing, more or less, to enslave mankind;—and whoever will take the trouble to examine, will find that by far the greater part of the different nations, who have fallen from the glorious state of liberty, owe their ruin to standing armies. It has been urged that they are necessary to provide against sudden attacks. Would not a well regulated militia, duly trained to discipline, afford ample security? Such, I conceive, to be the best, the surest means of protection, which a free people can have when not actually engaged in war. This kind of defence is attended with two advantages superior to any others; first, when it is necessary to embody an army, they at once form a band of soldiers, whose interests are uniformly the same [423]with those of the whole community, and in whose safety they see involved every thing that is dear to themselves: secondly, if one army is cut off, another may be immediately raised already trained for military service. By a policy, somewhat similar to this, the Roman empire rose to the highest pitch of grandeur and magnificence. The supreme court is another branch of federal authority, which wears the aspect of imperial jurisdiction, clad in dread array, and spreading its wide domain into all parts of the continent. This is to be co-extensive with the legislature, and, like that, is to swallow up all other courts of judicature.—For what is that judicial power which “shall extend to all cases in law and equity” in some having “original,” in all others “appellate jurisdiction,” but an establishment universal in its operation? And what is that “appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact,” but an establishment, which may in effect operate as original jurisdiction?—Or what is an appeal to enquire into facts after a solemn adjudication in any court below, but a trial de novo? And do not such trials clearly imply an incompetency in the inferior courts to exercise any kind of judicial authority with rectitude? Hence, will not this eventually annihilate their whole jurisdiction? Here is a system of jurisprudence to be erected, no less surprising than it is new and unusual. Here is an innovation, which bears no kind of analogy to any thing, that Englishmen, or Americans, the descendants of Englishmen, have ever yet experienced. Add to all, that this high prerogative court establishes no fundamental rule of proceeding, except that the trial by jury is allowed in some criminal cases. All other cases are left open—and subject “to such regulations as the Congress shall make.“—Under these circumstances I beseech you all, as citizens of Virginia, to consider seriously whether you will not endanger the solemn trial by jury, which you have long revered, as a sacred barrier against injustice—which has been established by your ancestors many centuries ago, and transmitted to you, as one of the greatest bulwarks of civil liberty—which you have to this day maintained inviolate:—I beseech you, I say, as members of this commonwealth, to consider whether you will not be in danger of losing this inestimable mode of trial in all those cases, wherein the constitution does not provide for its security. Nay, does not that very provision, which is made, by being confined to a few particular cases, almost imply a total exclusion of the rest? Let it, then, be a reflection deeply impressed on your minds—that if this noble privilege, which by long experience has been found the most exquisite method of determining controversies according to the scale of equal liberty, should once be taken away, it is unknown what new species of trial may be substituted in its room. Perhaps you may be surprised [424]with some strange piece of judicial polity,—some arbitrary method, perhaps confining all trials to the entire decision of the magistracy, and totally excluding the great body of the people from any share in the administration of public justice. (To be continued)"
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,3/5/1788,"(Concluded from our last.) After the most deliberate reflections on this important matter, permit me, my dear countrymen, to declare to you in the most unfeigned [460]manner, that not perceiving any thing in the proposed plan of government, which seems calculated to ensure the happiness of America—I could not, as a fellow-citizen, resist the inclination to impart these sentiments to you. Unmoved by party—rage—unassailed by passion—uninfluenced by any other interest, but the genuine effusion of zeal for this, our common country, I confess to you in the language of sincerity and candor, that after the first reading of this new code, I could not behold it, but with an eye of disapprobation. Unwilling, however, to reject at first sight an object of such high moment, I resolved to distrust the propriety of a construction passed at so early a period.—This led me to peruse it with the utmost diligence I was capable of; and believe me, the foregoing observations have arisen from the fullest conviction, that the system involves in it the most dangerous principles; and—so far from exalting the standard of American liberty, I fear indeed that, should it be adopted, this glorious work, which already has cost the lives of many worthy patriots, will ere long be leveled with the dust. Let it not be conjectured from hence that any illiberal conceptions are formed by the writer hereof respecting the intentions of those gentlemen, who have offered this plan of federal government. He knows no circumstance inducing him to suppose they had any other object in view but the good of their country.—When we contemplate the great—the magnanimous HERO, who has conducted our armies through all the trying vicissitudes of danger and difficultly,—there is no man so disingenuous—there is no man so ungrateful, as to impute any transactions of his to sinister motives. Every true American is well assured that steadiness of virtue—that benignity of soul have the chief rule in all his actions.—Yet every American, and every other person, are satisfied also that there is no infallibility in human nature.—To be man is to be subject to error. The best, the greatest, the wisest are liable to commit mistakes.—Let it be remembered, then, that this code of government is solemnly proposed to every freeman in America. For what?—For the purpose of binding them without their approbation? No.—For an implicit acceptance? No.—For their adoption merely in compliment to the general convention? No.—What then?—Every man’s duty to his country points out to him the end of this proposition. Every man knows that it is for a free, a candid, an impartial discussion and determination thereon; whether they will approve and adopt it; or whether they will disapprove and reject it. Can any citizen, therefore, be so weak? can any be so timid? so pusillanimous, as to acknowledge that he has no right to exercise his own judgment with any regard to this matter? If there should be any haughty spirits among us, who think that this subject ought to be [461]handled by none but a few persons of eminent characters, let such recollect that the dignity, the importance of their country should inspire sentiments more exalted than the highest characters—sentiments, that should correspond with the worth of America, not with the consequence of any mere individuals. Will you, then, Virginians, arrogate too much by boldly asserting the privilege to judge for yourselves in what so nearly concerns the cause of liberty? No, no, my countrymen, you will not arrogate too much; you will not; I avow it by the souls of those brave patriots, who fought for the same cause in the late war. You will in this affair act as becomes you. The rank, you hold amongst the nations of the earth, requires this of you. And you will forfeit that rank: you will forfeit the character of freemen; and shew that you deserve to be enslaved, if you decline that privilege. The happiness of a multitude of people is certainly the highest advantage, which can be conferred on any society: and if you will contribute a full share of duty to effect this, so shall you obtain a due share of glory. No pomp of character, no sound of names, no distinction of birth—no preeminence of any kind, should dispose you to hoodwink your own understandings; and in that state suffer yourselves to be led at the will of any order of men whatsoever. The part you have acted heretofore,—the brave, the noble efforts, you have made, are proof enough of your fortitude, and totally exclude every idea of pusillanimity. Herein you have evinced the highest sense of public virtue; herein you have manifested to the whole world that the cause of liberty has hitherto had the prevailing influence over your hearts. And shall men possessed of these sentiments? shall those valiant defenders of their country, who have not feared to encounter toil and danger in a thousand shapes? who have not startled, even at the prospect of death itself? Shall you, O Virginians; shall you, I say, after exhibiting such bright examples of true patriotic heroism, suddenly become inconsistent with yourselves; and were2 to maintain a privilege so incontestibly your due?—No, my countrymen;—by no means can I conceive that the laudable vigor, which flamed so high in every breast, can have so far evaporated in the space of five years. I doubt not, but you will in this trying instance acquit yourselves in a manner worthy of your former conduct. It is not to be feared that you need the force of persuasion, to exercise a proper freedom of enquiry into the merits of this proposed plan of government: or that you will not pay a due attention to the welfare of that country, for which you have already so bravely exerted yourselves. Of this I am well assured; and do not wonder when imagination presents to my view the idea of a numerous and respectable body of men reasoning on the principles of this federal constitution. If herein [462]I conceive that you are alarmed at the exceedingly high and extensive authority, which it is intended to establish, I cannot but see the strongest reasons for such apprehensions. For a system, which is to supersede the present different governments of the states, by ordaining that “laws made in pursuance thereof shall be supreme, and shall bind the judges in every state, any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding,” must be alarming indeed! What cannot this omnipotence of power effect? How will your bill of rights avail you any thing? By this authority the Congress can make laws, which shall bind all, repugnant to your present constitution—repugnant to every article of your rights; for they are a part of your constitution,—they are the basis of it. So that if you pass this new constitution, you will have a naked plan of government unlimited in its jurisdiction, which not only expunges your bill of rights by rendering ineffectual, all the state governments; but is proposed without any kind of stipulation for any of those natural rights, the security whereof ought to be the end of all governments. Such a stipulation is so necessary, that it is an absurdity to suppose any civil liberty can exist without it. Because it cannot be alledged in any case whatsoever, that a breach has been committed—that a right has been violated; as there will be no standard to resort to—no criterion to ascertain the breach, or even to find whether there has been any violation at all. Hence it is evident that the most flagrant acts of oppression may be inflicted; yet, still there will be no apparent object injured: there will be no unconstitutional infringement. For instance, if Congress should pass a law that persons charged with capital crimes shall not have a right to demand the cause or nature of the accusation, shall not be confronted with the accusers or witnesses, or call for evidence in their own favor; and a question should arise respecting their authority therein,—can it be said that they have exceeded the limits of their jurisdiction, when that has no limits; when no provision has been made for such a right?—When no responsibility on the part of Congress has been required by the constitution? The same observation may be made on any arbitrary or capricious imprisonments contrary to the law of the land. The same may be made, if excessive bail should be required; if excessive fines should be imposed; if cruel and unusual punishments should be inflicted; if the liberty of the press should be restrained; in a word—if laws should be made totally derogatory to the whole catalogue of rights, which are now secure under your present form of government. You will, doubtless, consider whether the inconveniencies may not be very disagreeable, and perhaps injurious, to which this country may be subjected by excise laws,—by direct taxation of every kind,—by the [463]establishment of federal courts. You will advert to the dangerous and oppressive consequences, that may ensue from the introduction of standing armies in times of peace; those baneful engines of ambition, against which free nations have always guarded with the greatest degree of caution. You will determine likewise as to the propriety of being excluded from keeping ships of war without the consent of Congress. The situation of these states renders a naval force extremely desirable. Being bounded on one side by the sea, their coasts are accessible to every lawless adventurer: and without ships to guard them, they are subject to continual depredations. The expediency of this species of defence is manifest. The great advantages to be derived from it,—the strength,—the consequence, which it adds to a nation, are such, that every well-wisher to this country would rejoice to see as large a navy established, as the circumstances of the state can at any time admit of. This, therefore, seems to be a very improper restraint upon the states,—a restraint, which may perhaps eventually prove very injurious. Upon the whole, my fellow-citizens, if you judge this proposed constitution to be eligible or ineligible, you will accordingly instruct your delegates when they are about to meet in convention. The wisdom of the legislature has judged it advisable to fix the time for deciding on this momentous business at the distance of several months, that you may become thoroughly acquainted with a subject, which so nearly concerns your greatest interests. I know it is a favorite topic with the advocates for the new government—that it will advance the dignity of Congress; and that the energy, which is now wanting in the federal system, will be hereby rendered efficient. Nobody doubts, but the government of the union is susceptible of amendment. But can any one think that there is no medium between want of power, and the possession of it in an unlimited degree? Between the imbecility of mere recommendatory propositions, and the sweeping jurisdiction of exercising every branch of government over the United States to the greatest extent? Between the present feeble texture of the confederation, and the proposed nervous ligaments? Is it not possible to strengthen the hands of Congress so far as to enable them to comply with all the exigenc[i]es of the union—to regulate the great commercial concerns of the continent,—to superintend all affairs, which relate to the United States in their aggregate capacity, without devolving upon that body the supreme powers of government in all its branches? The original institution of Congressional business,—the nature, the end of that institution evince the practicability of such a reform; and shew that it is more honorable, more glorious—and will be more happy for each American state to retain [464]its independent sovereignty. For what can be more truly great in any country than a number of different states in the full enjoyment of liberty—exercising distinct powers of government; yet associated by one general head, and under the influence of a mild, just and well-organized confederation duly held in equilibrio;—whilst all derive those external advantages, which are the great purposes of the union? This separate independency existing in each—this harmony pervading the whole—this due degree of energy in the federal department, all together, will form a beautiful species of national grandeur. These will add lustre to every member, and spread a glory all around. These will command the admiration of mankind. These will exhibit a bright specimen of real dignity, far superior to that immense devolution of power, under which the sovereignty of each state shall shrink to nothing. It requires no great degree of knowledge in history to learn what dangerous consequences generally result from large and extensive powers. Every man has a natural propensity to power; and when one degree of it is obtained, that seldom fails to excite a thirst for more;—an higher point being gained, still the soul is impelled to a farther pursuit. Thus step by step, in regular progression, she proceeds onward; until the lust of domination becomes the ruling passion, and absorbs all other desires. When any man puts himself under the influence of such a passion, it is natural for him to seek after every opportunity, and to employ every means within reach, for obtaining his purpose. There is something so exceedingly bewitching in the possession of power that hardly a man can enjoy it, and not be affected after an unusual manner. The pomp of superiority carries with it charms, which operate strongly on the imagination. Nay, it is a melancholy reflection that too often the very disposition itself is transformed,—and for the gratification of ambitious views, the mild, the gentle, humane—the virtuous become cruel and violent, losing all sense of honor, probity, humanity and gratitude.—Hence, should it not be a maxim, never to be forgotten—that a free people ought to intrust no set of men with powers, that may be abused without controul, or afford opportunities to designing men to carry dangerous measures into execution, without being responsible for their conduct? And as no human foresight can penetrate so far into future events, as to guard always against the effects of vice,—as the securest governments are seldom secure enough;—is it not the greatest imprudence to adopt a system, which has an apparent tendency to furnish ambitious men with the means of exerting themselves—perhaps to the destruction of American liberty? It is next to impossible to enslave a people immediately after a firm struggle against oppression, while the sense of past injury is recent [465]and strong. But after some time this impression naturally wears off;—the ardent glow of freedom gradually evaporates;—the charms of popular equality, which arose from the republican plan, insensibly decline;—the pleasures, the advantages derived from the new kind of government grow stale through use. Such declension in all these vigorous springs of action necessarily produces a supineness. The altar of liberty is no longer watched with such attentive assiduity;—a new train of passions succeeds to the empire of the mind;—different objects of desire take place;—and, if the nation happens to enjoy a series of prosperity, voluptuousness, excessive fondness for riches, and luxury gain admission and establish themselves—these produce venality and corruption of every kind, which open a fatal avenue to bribery. Hence it follows, that in the midst of this general contageon a few men—or one—more powerful than all others, industriously endeavor to obtain all authority; and by means of great wealth—or embezzling the public money,—perhaps totally subvert the government, and erect a system of aristocratical or monarchic tyranny in its room. What ready means for this work of evil are numerous standing armies, and the disposition of the great revenue of the United States! Money can purchase soldiers;—soldiers can produce money; and both together can do any thing. It is this depravation of manners, this wicked propensity, my dear countrymen, against which you ought to provide with the utmost degree of prudence and circumspection. All nations pass this paroxism of vice at some period or other;—and if at that dangerous juncture your government is not secured upon a solid foundation, and well guarded against the machinations of evil men, the liberties of this country will be lost—perhaps forever! Let us establish a strong federal government, which shall render our Congress a great and eminent body, says one. By all means, replies another; and then they will command the attention of all Europe.—Why, pray, what will it avail you in the hour of distress—in the midst of calamity, though all Europe should pay attention to the Congress? What advantage will it be to the citizens of America, should they elevate Congress to the highest degree of grandeur;—should the sound of that grandeur be wafted across the Atlantic, and echoe through every town in Europe? What will the pomp—the splendor of that dignified body profit you, I say, if you place yourselves in a situation, which may terminate in wretchedness? Of what consequence will that state of congressional preeminence be to you, or to your posterity, if either the one, or the other should thereby be reduced to a mere herd of—? O great GOD, avert that dreadful catastrophe.—Let not the day be permitted to dawn, which shall discover to the world that America [466]remains no longer a free nation!—O let not this last sacred asylum of persecuted liberty cease to afford a resting place for that fair goddess!—Re-animate each spirit, that languishes in this glorious cause! Shine in upon us, and illumine all our counsels!—Suffer thy bright ministers of grace to come down and direct us;—and hovering for awhile on the wings of affection, breathe into our souls true sentiments of wisdom!—that in this awful, this important moment we may be conducted safely through the maze of error!—that a firm basis of national happiness may be established, and flourish in undiminished glory through all succeeding ages! P. P. December 17, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journnal,Landholder No. X,3/7/1788,"Mr. Goddard, Sir, In consequence of the justice I did Mr. Gerry, on a former occasion, I find myself complimented with an Address in your last Paper.—Whether the Landholder of the Connecticut Courant, and of the Maryland Journal, is the same person, or different, is not very material;—I however incline to the former opinion, as I hope, for the honour of human nature, it would be difficult to find more than one individual, who could be capable of so total a disregard to the principles of truth and honour. After having made the most unjust and illiberal attack on Mr. Gerry, and stigmatized him as an enemy to his country, and the basest of mankind, for no other reason than a firm and conscientious discharge [372]of an important trust reposed in that gentleman, had I not come in for a share of his censure, I confess I should have been both disappointed and mortified—It would have had at least the appearance, that the Landholder had discovered something in my principles, which he considered congenial with his own—However great may be my political sins, to be cursed with his approbation and applause, would be a punishment much beyond their demerit. But, Sir, at present, I mean to confine myself to the original subject of controversy, the injustice of the charges made against Mr. Gerry. That my veracity will not be questioned when giving my negative to anonymous slander, I have the fullest confidence—I have equal confidence that it will be as little questioned by any who know me, even should the Landholder vouchsafe to give the Public his name1—a respectable name I am sure it cannot be—His absolute want of truth and candour in assertions meant to injure the reputation of individuals, whose names are given to the Public, and to hold them up to the indignation of their fellow-citizens, will ever justify this assertion, even should the name belong to one decorated with wealth, or dignified by station. But the Landholder wishes it to be supposed, that though my veracity should not be doubted, yet my evidence ought to be rejected, and observes, that to comprehend what credit ought to be given to it, (by which, I suppose, he means its sufficiency if credited) it ought to be known how long I was absent from Convention, as well as the time I attended. I believe, Sir, whoever will read my former publication, will in a moment perceive, that I there “stated” all the “information” on this subject, that was “necessary” or material, and that I left no defect for the Landholder to supply—I there mentioned, that “I took my seat early in June, that I left Philadelphia on the fourth of September, and during that period, was not absent from the Convention while sitting, except only five days in the beginning of August, immediately after the Committee of Detail had reported.” I did not state the precise day of June when I took my seat—it was the ninth, not the tenth—a very inconsiderable mistake of the Landholder—But between that day and the fourth of September, he says, that I was absent ten days at Baltimore, and as many at New-York; and thereby insinuates, that an absence of twenty days from the Convention intervened during that period, in which time Mr. Gerry might have made, and failed in, his motion concerning continental money. A short state of facts is all that is necessary to shew the disingenuity of the Landholder, and that it is very possible to convey a falsehood, [373]or something very much like it, almost in the words of truth—On the twenty-fifth [i.e., sixth] of July the Convention adjourned, to meet again on the sixth of August—I embraced that opportunity to come to Baltimore, and left Philadelphia on the twenty seventh; I returned on the fourth of August, and on the sixth attended the Convention, with such members as were in town, at which time the Committee of Detail made their report, and many of the members being yet absent, we adjourned to the next day—Mr. Gerry left Philadelphia to go to NewYork, the day before I left there to come to Baltimore; he had not returned on Tuesday the seventh of August,2 when I set out for New-York, from whence I returned and took my seat in Convention on Monday the thirteenth. It is true that from the twenty-fifth of July to the thirteenth of August, eighteen (not twenty) days had elapsed; but on one of those days I attended, and on twelve of them the Convention did not meet; I was therefore perfectly correct in my original statement, that from early in June till the fourth of September, I was absent but five days from the Convention while sitting, and in that statement omitted no “necessary information”—It is also true, that of those eighteen days Mr. Gerry was absent twelve or thirteen, and that one of those days when he was not absent was Sunday, on which day the Convention did not meet. Thus, Sir, by relating facts as they really occurred, we find the only time between early in June and the fourth of September, when such a motion could have been made by Mr. Gerry, without my being present, is narrowed down to four, or at most five days, as I originally stated it, although the Landholder wishes it should be supposed there were twenty days during that period, when it might have taken place without my knowledge, to wit, ten while I was at Baltimore, and as many more while at New-York. The Landholder also states, that the Convention commenced the fourteenth day of May, and that I did not take my seat till the tenth day of June, by which, if he means any thing, I presume he means to insinuate, that within that portion of time, Mr. Gerry’s motion might have been made and rejected. He is here, Sir, equally unfortunate and disingenuous—Though the Convention was to have met by appointment on the fourteenth of May, yet no material business was entered upon till on or about the thirtieth of that month: It was on that day that the Convention, having had certain propositions laid before them by the Honourable Governor of Virginia, resolved to go into a consideration of those propositions3—In this fact I am confident I am not mistaken, as I state the day not merely from my own recollection, from minutes, which I believe to be very correct, in my possession, of the information given by the Honourable Mr. McHenry, to the assembly.4 [374]The truth is, Sir, that very little progress had been made by the Convention before I arrived, and that they had not been more than ten days, or about that time, seriously engaged in business.—The first thing I did after I took my seat was carefully to examine the journals for information of what had already been done or proposed—I was also furnished with notes of the debates which had taken place, and can with truth say, that I made myself “minutely informed” of what had happened before that period—In the same manner, after my return from New-York, I consulted the journals, (for we were permitted to read them, although we were not always permitted to take copies)—If the motion attributed to Mr. Gerry, had been made and rejected either before I first took my seat, or while at New-York, it would have there appeared; and that no such motion was made and rejected during either of those periods, I appeal to the highest possible authority—I appeal to those very journals, which ought to have been published, and which we are informed are placed in the possession of our late Honourable President5—But why, Sir, should I appeal to those journals, or to any other authority? Let the Landholder turn to his eighth number, addressed to the Honourable Mr. Gerry—let him blush, unless incapable of that sensation, while he reads the following passage! “Almost the whole time during the sitting of the Convention, and until the constitution had received its present form, no man was more plausible and conciliating on every subject than Mr. Gerry,” &c. “Thus stood Mr. Gerry till towards the close of the business, he introduced a motion respecting the redemption of paper-money”6—The whole time of the sitting of the Convention was not almost past—The Constitution had not received its present form—nor was the business drawing towards a close until long after I took my seat in Convention. It is therefore proved by the Landholder himself, that Mr. Gerry did not make this motion at any time before the ninth day of June—Nay more, in the paper now before me he acknowledges, that in his eighth number he meant (and surely no one ought to know his meaning better than himself) “to fix Mr. Gerry’s apostacy to a period within the last thirteen days.[”]7 Why then all this misrepresentation of my absence at Baltimore and New-York? Why the attempt to induce a belief that the Convention had been engaged in business from the fourteenth of May, and the insinuation that it might have happened in those periods? And why the charge that in not stating those facts I had withheld from the public information necessary to its forming a right judgment of the credit which ought to be given to my evidence? But, Sir, I am really at a loss which most to admire, the depravity of this writer’s heart, or the weakness of his head!—Is it possible he [375]should not perceive that the moment he fixes the time of Mr. Gerry’s motion to the last thirteen days of the Convention, he proves incontestibly the falshood and malice of his charges against that gentleman? for he has expressly stated that this motion and the rejection it received was the cause, and the sole cause, of his apostacy; that “before, there was nothing in the system, as it now stands, to which he had any objection, but that afterwards he was inspired with the utmost rage and intemperate opposition to the whole system he had formerly praised;”8—whereas I have shewn to the clearest demonstration, that a considerable time before the last thirteen days, Mr. Gerry had given the most decided opposition to the system; I have shewn this by recital of facts, which if credited, incontestibly prove it—facts which I again repeat, will never be contradicted by any member of the Convention—I ground this assertion upon the fullest conviction, that it is impossible to find a single person in that number so wicked, as publicly and deliberately to prostitute his name in support of falsehood, and at the same time so weak as to do this when he must be sure of detection. But the Landholder is willing to have it supposed, that Mr. Gerry might have made the motion in a “Committee,” and that there it might have happened without my knowledge; to such wretched subterfuges is he driven. This evasion, however, will be equally unavailing. The business of the committees were not of a secret nature, nor were they conducted in a secret manner; I mean as to the members of the Convention. I am satisfied that there was no committee while I was there, of whose proceedings I was not at least “so minutely informed,”9 that an attempt of so extraordinary a nature as that attributed to Mr. Gerry, and attended with such an immediate and remarkable revolution in his conduct, could not have taken place without my having heard something concerning it.—The non-adoption of a measure by a committee did not preclude its being proposed to the Convention, and being there adopted. Can it be presumed that a question in which Mr. Gerry is represented to have been so deeply interested, and by the fate of which his conduct was entirely influenced, would, for want of success in a committee, have been totally relinquished by him, without a single effort to carry it in Convention?—If any other proof is wanting, I appeal again to the Landholder himself:—In his eighth number he states that the motion was rejected “by the Convention”—Let it be remembered also, as I have before observed, in the paper now before me, he declares it was his intention in that number to fix Mr. Gerry’s apostacy to a period within the last thirteen days; and in the same number he observes, that Mr. Gerry’s resentment could only embarrass and delay the completion of the business for a few days; all which equally militates [376]against every idea of the motion being made before I left Philadelphia, whether in Committee, or in Convention. The Landholder hath also asserted, that I have “put into Mr. Gerry’s mouth, objections different from any thing his letter to the legislature of his state contains, so that if my representation is true, his must be false.”10 In this charge he is just as well founded as in those I have already noticed.—Mr. Gerry has more than once published to the world, under the sanction of his name, that he opposed the system from a firm persuasion that it would endanger the liberties of America, and destroy the freedom of the states and their citizens.11 Every word which I have stated as coming from his mouth, so far from being inconsistent with those declarations, are perfectly correspondent thereto, and direct proofs of their truth. When the Landholder informed us that Mr. Gerry was “face to face with his colleagues in the Convention of Massachusetts,”12 why did he not, unless he wished to mislead the public, also inform us for what purpose he was there? That it was only to answer questions that might be proposed to him, not himself to ask questions—that he could not consistently interfere in any manner in the debates—and that he was even prohibited an opportunity of explaining such parts of his conduct as were censured in his presence.13 By the anonymous publication alluded to by the Landholder,14 and inserted in the note, Mr. Gerry’s colleagues are not called upon to acquit him; it only declares “that he believes them to be men of too much honour to assert that his reasons in Convention were totally different from those he published;”—and in this, I presume, he was not disappointed—the Landholder otherwise would have published it with triumph;—but if Mr. Gerry, as it is insinuated, was only prevented by pride from, in person, requesting them to acquit him, it amounts to a proof of his consciousness that, as men of honour, they could not have refused it, had he made the request. No person, who views the absurdities and inconsistencies of the Landholder, can, I think, have a very respectable opinion of his understanding; but I, who am not much prejudiced in his favour, could scarcely have conceived him so superlatively weak as to expect to deceive the public and obtain credit to himself, by asking “if the charges against Mr. Gerry are not true, why do not his colleagues contradict them?”15 and “why is it that we do not see Mr. McHenry’s verification of your assertions?”16—If these gentlemen were to do Mr. Gerry that justice, he might as well inquire “why is it we do not also see the verification” of A, B, C and D, and so on to the last letter of the conventional alphabet. When the Landholder, in his eighth number, addressed himself to Mr. Gerry, he introduced his charges by saying, “you doubtless will recollect the following state of facts;—if you do not, every member of the Convention will attest them.”17 One member of the Convention has had firmness sufficient to contradict them with his name, although he was well apprised that he thereby exposed himself as a mark for the arrows of his political adversaries, and as to some of them, he was not unacquainted with what kind of men he had to deal: But of all the members who composed that body, not one has yet stepped forward to make good the Landholder’s prediction; nor has one been found to “attest” his statement of facts. Many reasons may be assigned why the members of the Convention should not think themselves under a moral obligation of involving themselves in controversy, by giving their names in vindication of Mr. Gerry; and I do not believe any of those who signed the proposed Constitution would consider themselves bound to do this by any political obligation:—But, Sir, I can hardly suppose that Mr. Gerry is so perfectly esteemed and respected by every person who had a seat in that body, that not a single individual could possibly be procured to give his sanction to the Landholder’s charges, if it could be done with justice; and as to myself, I much question whether it would be easy to convince any person, who was present at our information to the assembly, that every one of my honourable colleagues (to each of whose merit I cordially subscribe, though compelled to differ from them in political sentiments) would be prevented by motives of personal delicacy to myself, from contradicting the facts I have stated relative to Mr. Gerry, if it could be done consistent with truth. If the Landholder was a member of the Convention, to facilitate the adoption of a favourite system, or to gratify his resentment against its opposers, he has originally invented, and is now labouring to support, charges the most unjust and ungenerous, contrary to his own knowledge of facts.—If he was not a member, he is acting the same part, without any knowledge of the subject, and in this has the merit of either following his own invention, or of dealing out the information he receives from some person of whom he is the wretched tool and dupe, at the same time expressing himself with a decision, and making such professions of being perfectly in every secret, as naturally tends, unless contradicted, to deceive and delude the unsuspecting multitude. In one of these predicaments the Landholder must stand—he is welcome to take his choice—in either case he only wants to be known to be despised. Now, Sir, let the Landholder come forward and give his name to the public—It is the only thing necessary to finish his character—and to convince the world that he is as dead to shame, as he is lost to truth and destitute of honour. If I, Sir, can be instrumental in procuring him to disclose himself; even in this I shall consider myself as rendering a service to my country.—I flatter myself, for the dignity of human kind, there are few such characters; but there is no situation in life, in which they may not prove the bane and curse of society;—they, therefore, ought to be known, that they may be guarded against. I am, Sir, your very humble servant, Baltimore, March 3, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/18/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. To you, my fellow-citizens, I hold myself in a particular manner accountable for every part of my conduct in the exercise of a trust reposed in me by you, and should consider myself highly culpable if I was to withhold from you any information in my possession, the knowledge of which may be material to enable you to form a right judgment on questions wherein the happiness of yourselves and your posterity are involved—Nor shall I ever consider it an act of condescension when impeached in my public conduct, or character, to vindicate myself at your bar, and to submit myself to your decision. In conformity to these sentiments, which have regulated my conduct since my return from the Convention, and which will be the rule of my actions in the sequel, I shall, at this time, beg your indulgence, while I make some observations on a Publication which the Landholder has done me the honour to address to me, in the Maryland Journal, of the 29th of February last. In my controversy with that writer, on the subject of Mr. Gerry, I have already enabled you to decide, without difficulty, on the credit which ought to be given to his most positive assertions, and should scarce think it worth my time to notice his charges against myself, was it not for the opportunity it affords me of stating certain facts and transactions, of which you ought to be informed, some of which were undesignedly omitted by me when I had the honour of being called before the House of Delegates.1 No “extreme modesty” on my part was requisite to induce me to conceal the “sacrifice of resentments” against Mr. Gerry—since no [398]such sacrifice had ever been made—nor had any such resentments ever existed—The principal opposition in sentiment between Mr. Gerry and myself, was on the subject of representation; but even on that subject, he was much more conceding than his colleagues, two of whom obstinately persisted in voting against the equality of representation in the Senate, when the question was taken in Convention upon the adoption of the conciliatory propositions, on the fate of which depended, I believe, the continuance of the Convention.2 In many important questions we perfectly harmonized in opinion, and where we differed, it never was attended with warmth or animosity, nor did it in any respect interfere with a friendly intercourse, and interchange of attention and civilities.—We both opposed the extraordinary powers over the militia, given to the general government3—we were both against the re-eligibility of the president4—we both concurred in the attempt to prevent members of each branch of the legislature from being appointable to offices,5 and in many other instances, although the Landholder, with his usual regard to truth, and his usual imposing effrontery, tells me, that I “doubtless must remember Mr. Gerry and myself never voted alike, except in the instances” he has mentioned. As little foundation is there in his assertion, that I “cautioned certain members to be on their guard against his wiles, for that he and Mr. Mason held private meetings, where the plans were concerted to aggrandize, at the expence of the small States, old Massachusetts and the ancient dominion.” I need only state facts to refute the assertion. Some time in the month of August, a number of members who considered the system, as then under consideration, and likely to be adopted, extremely exceptionable, and of a tendency to destroy the rights and liberties of the United States, thought it advisable to meet together in the evenings, in order to have a communication of sentiments, and to concert a plan of conventional opposition to, and amendment of that system, so as, if possible, to render it less dangerous. Mr. Gerry was the first who proposed this measure to me, and that before any meeting had taken place, and wished we might assemble at my lodgings; but not having a room convenient, we fixed upon another place—There Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason did hold meetings; but with them also met the Delegates from New-Jersey and Connecticut, a part of the delegation from Delaware, an honourable member from South-Carolina, one other from Georgia, and myself—These were the only “private meetings” that ever I knew or heard to be held by Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason—meetings at which I myself attended until I left the Convention—and of which the sole object was not to aggrandize the great at the expence of the small, but to protect and preserve, if possible, the existence and essential rights of all the States, and the liberty and freedom [399]of their citizens.6 Thus, my fellow-citizens, I am obliged, unless I could accept the compliment at an expence of truth equal to the Landholder’s, to give up all claim to being “placed beyond the reach of ordinary panegyrick,” and to that “magnanimity” which he was so solicitous to bestow upon me, that he has wandered the regions of falsehood to seek the occasion. When we find such disregard of truth even in the introduction, while only on the threshold, we may form some judgment what respect is to be paid to the information he shall give us of what passed in the Convention, when he “draws aside the veil”—a veil which was interposed between our proceedings and the Public, in my opinion, for the most dangerous of purposes, and which was never designed by the advocates of the system to be drawn aside, or if ever, not till it should be too late for any beneficial purpose7—which as far as it is done or pretended to be done, on the present occasion, is only for the purpose of deception and misrepresentation. It was on Saturday8 that I first took my seat—I obtained that day a copy of the propositions that had been laid before the Convention, and which were then the subject of discussion in a committee of the whole.9 The secretary was so polite as, at my request, to wait upon me at the State-House the next day (being Sunday) and there gave me an opportunity of examining the journals, and making myself acquainted with the little that had been done before my arrival—I was not a little surprised at the system brought forward, and was solicitous to learn the reasons which had been assigned in its support; for this purpose the journals could be of no service, I therefore conversed on the subject with different members of the Convention, and was favoured with minutes of the debates, which had taken place before my arrival—I applied to history for what lights it could afford me—and I procured every thing the most valuable I could find in Philadelphia, on the subject of governments in general, and on the American revolution and governments in particular10—I devoted my whole time and attention to the business in which we were engaged, and made use of all the opportunities I had, and abilities I possessed, conscientiously to decide what part I ought to adopt in the discharge of that sacred duty I owed to my country, in the exercise of the trust you had reposed in me—I attended the Convention many days without taking any share in the debates, listening in silence to the eloquence of others, and offering no other proof that I possessed the powers of speech, than giving my yea or nay when a question was taken, and notwithstanding my propensity to “endless garrulity,” should have been extremely happy if I could have continued that line of conduct, without making a sacrifice of your rights and political happiness. The committee of the whole house had made but small progress, at the time I arrived, in the discussion of the propositions which had been referred to them; they completed that discussion, and made their report—The propositions of the minority were then brought forward and rejected11—The Convention had resumed the report of the committee, and had employed some days in its consideration—Thirty days,12 I believe, or more, had elapsed from my taking my seat before, in the language of the Landholder, I “opened in a speech which held during two days”.13—Such, my fellow-citizens, is the true state of the conduct I pursued when I took my seat in Convention, and which the Landholder, to whom falshood appears more familiar than truth, with his usual effrontery, has misrepresented by a positive declaration, that without obtaining, or endeavouring to obtain, any information on the subject, I hastily and insolently obtruded my sentiments on the Convention, and, to the astonishment of every member present, on the very day I took my seat, began a speech, which continued two days, in opposition to those measures, which, on mature deliberation, had been adopted by the Convention. But I “alone advocated the political heresy, that the people ought not to be trusted with the election of representatives.” On this subject, as I would wish to be on every other, my fellow-citizens, I have been perfectly explicit in the information I gave to the House of Delegates, and which has since been published.14—In a state government, I consider all power flowing immediately from the people in their individual capacity, and that the people, in their individual capacity, have, and ever ought to have, the right of choosing delegates in a state legislature; the business of which is to make laws, regulating their concerns, as individuals, and operating upon them as such; but, in a federal government, formed over free states, the power flows from the people, and the right of choosing delegates belongs to them only mediately through their respective state governments, which are the members composing the federal government, and from whom all its power immediately proceeds; to which state governments, the choice of the federal delegates immediately belongs.—I should blush, indeed, for my ignorance of the first elements of government, was I to entertain different sentiments on this subject; and if this is “political heresy,” I have no ambition to be ranked with those who are orthodox.—Let me here, my fellow-citizens, by way of caution, add an observation, which will prove to be founded in truth—those who are the most liberal in complimenting you with powers which do not belong to you, act commonly from improper and interested motives, and most generally have in view thereby to prepare the way for depriving you of those rights to which you are [401]justly entitled.—Every thing that weakens and impairs the bands of legitimate authority, smooths the road of ambition; nor can there be a surer method of supporting and preserving the just rights of the people, than by supporting and protecting the just rights of Government. As to the “jargon” attributed to me of maintaining [“]that notwithstanding each state had an equal number of votes in the Senate, yet the states were unequally represented in the Senate,” the Landholder has all the merit of its absurdity; nor can I conceive what sentiment it is that I ever have expressed, to which he, with his usual perversion and misrepresentation, could give such a colouring. That I ever suggested the idea of letting loose an army indiscriminately on the innocent and guilty, in a state refusing to comply with the requisitions of Congress, or that such an idea ever had place in my mind, is a falsehood so groundless, so base and malignant, that it could only have originated or been devised by a heart which would dishonour the midnight assassin. My sentiments on this subject are well known; it was only in the case where a state refused to comply with the requisitions of Congress, that I was willing to grant the general government those powers which the proposed constitution gives it in every case.(a)15—Had I been a greater friend to a standing army, and not quite so averse to exposing your liberties to a soldiery, I do not believe the Landholder would have chose me for the object on whom to expend his artillery of falsehood. That a system may enable government wantonly to exercise power over the militia, to call out an unreasonable number from any particular state without its permission, and to march them upon, and continue them in, remote and improper services—that the same system should enable the government totally to discard, render useless, and even disarm the militia, when it would remove them out of the way of opposing its ambitious views, is by no means inconsistent, and is really the case in the proposed constitution:—In both these respects it is, in my opinion, highly faulty, and ought to be amended. In the proposed system, the general government has a power not only without the consent, but contrary to the will of the state government, to call out the whole of its militia, without regard to religious scruples, or any other consideration, and to continue them in service as long as it pleases, thereby subjecting the freemen of a whole state to martial law, and reducing them to the situation of slaves.—It has also, by another clause, the powers, by which only the militia can be organized and armed, and by the neglect of which they may be rendered utterly useless and insignificant, when it suits the ambitious purposes of government:—Nor is the suggestion unreasonable, even if it had been made, that the government [402]might improperly oppress and harrass the militia, the better to reconcile them to the idea of regular troops, who might relieve them from the burthen, and to render them less opposed to the measures it might be disposed to adopt for the purpose of reducing them to that state of insignificancy and uselessness. When the Landholder declared that “I contended the powers and authorities of the new constitution must destroy the liberties of the people,” he, for once, stumbled on the truth; but even this he could not avoid coupling with an assertion utterly false. I never suggested that “the same powers could be safely entrusted to the old Congress;”—on the contrary, I opposed many of the powers as being of that nature that, in my opinion, they could not be entrusted to any government whatever, consistent with the freedom of the states and their citizens; and earnestly recommended, what I wish, my fellow-citizens, deeply to impress on your minds, that in altering or amending our federal government, no greater powers ought to be given than experience has shewn to be necessary, since it will be easy to delegate further power when time shall dictate the expediency or necessity; but powers once bestowed upon a government, should they be found ever so dangerous or destructive to freedom, cannot be resumed or wrested from government, but by another revolution. Baltimore, March 14, 1788. (a) According to this idea, I endeavoured to obtain as an amendment to the system, the following clause: “And whenever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue shall be raised by direct taxation, having apportioned the same by the above rule, requisitions shall be made of the respective states to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas, within a time in the said requisition to be specified; and in case of any of the states failing to comply with such requisition, then, and then only, to have power to devise and pass acts directing the mode, and authorizing the same in the state failing therein.”—This was rejected, and that power, which I wished to have given the government only in this particular instance, is given to it, without any restraint or limitation, in every case."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/21/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. In the recognition which the Landholder professes to make “of what occurred to my advantage,” he equally deals in the arts of misrepresentation, as while he was “only the record of the bad,” and I am equally obliged, from a regard to truth, to disclaim his pretended approbation as his avowed censure. He declares, that I originated the clause which enacts, that “this Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or the laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” To place this matter in a proper point of view, it will be necessary to state, that as the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, a power was given to the general government to negative the laws passed by the state legislatures—a power [414]which I considered as totally inadmissible;—in substitution of this, I proposed the following clause, which you will find very materially different from the clause adopted by the Constitution, “that the legislative acts of the United States, made by virtue and in pursuance of the articles of the union, and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the respective states, so far as those acts or treaties shall relate to the said states, or their citizens; and that the judiciaries of the several states shall be bound thereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws of the individual states to the contrary notwithstanding.”1 When this clause was introduced, it was not established that inferior continental courts should be appointed for trial of all questions arising on treaties and on the laws of the general government,2 and it was my wish and hope that every question of that kind would have been determined, in the first instance, in the courts of the respective states; had this been the case, the propriety and the necessity that treaties duly made and ratified, and the laws of the general government should be binding on the state judiciaries, which were to decide upon them, must be evident to every capacity, while, at the same time, if such treaties or laws were inconsistent with our constitution and bill of rights, the judiciaries of this state would be bound to reject the first and abide by the last; since in the form I introduced the clause, notwithstanding treaties and the laws of the general government were intended to be superior to the laws of our state government, where they should be opposed to each other, yet that they were not proposed, nor meant to be superior to our constitution and bill of rights. It was afterwards altered and amended (if it can be called an amendment) to the form in which it stands in the system now published,3 and, as inferior continental, and not state, courts are originally to decide on those questions, it is now worse than useless; for being so altered as to render the treaties and laws made under the general government superior to our constitution, if the system is adopted, it will amount to a total and unconditional surrender to that government, by the citizens of this state, of every right and privilege secured to them by our constitution, and an express compact and stipulation with the general government, that it may, at its discretion, make laws in direct violation of those rights: But on this subject I shall enlarge in a future number.4 That I “voted an appeal should lay to the supreme judiciary of the United States, for the correction of all errors both in law and fact,” in rendering judgment, is most true; and it is equally true that if it had been so ordained by the Constitution, the supreme judiciary would only have had an appellate jurisdiction, of the same nature with that possessed by our high court of appeals,5 and could not in any respect intermeddle [415]with any fact decided by a jury; but as the clause now stands, an appeal being given in general terms from the inferior courts, both as to law and fact, it not only doth, but was avowedly intended to give a power very different from what our court of appeals, or any court of appeals in the United States or in England enjoys—a power of the most dangerous and alarming nature, that of setting at nought the verdict of a jury, and having the same facts which they had determined, without any regard or respect to their determination, examined and ultimately decided by the judges themselves; and that by judges immediately appointed by the government. But the Landholder also says, that “I agreed to the clause that declares nine states to be sufficient to put the government in motion.”— I cannot take to myself the merit even of this, without too great a sacrifice of truth.— It was proposed that if seven states agreed, that should be sufficient;—by a rule of convention in filling up blanks, if different numbers were mentioned, the question was always to be taken on the highest: It was my opinion, that to agree upon a ratification of the constitution by any less number than the whole thirteen states, is so directly repugnant to our present articles of confederation, and the mode therein prescribed for their alteration, and such a violation of the compact which the states, in the most solemn manner, have entered into with each other, that those who could advocate a contrary proposition, ought never to be confided in and entrusted in public life6—I availed myself of this rule, and had the question taken on thirteen, which was rejected—Twelve, eleven, ten and nine were proposed in succession; the last was adopted by a majority of the members—I voted successively for each of these numbers, to prevent a less number being agreed on—Had nine not been adopted, I should on the same principle have voted for eight: But so far was I from giving my approbation that the assent of a less number of states than thirteen should be sufficient to put the government in motion, that I most explicitly expressed my sentiments to the contrary, and always intended, had I been present when the ultimate vote was taken on the constitution, to have given it my decided negative, accompanied with a solem[n] protest against it, assigning this reason among others for my dissent. Thus, my fellow-citizens, that candour with which I have conducted myself through the whole of this business, obliges me, however reluctantly, and however “mortifying it may be to my vanity” to disavow all “those greater positive virtues” which the Landholder has so obligingly attributed to me in Convention, and which he was so desirous of conferring upon me as to consider the guilt of misrepresentation and falsehood but a trifling sacrifice for that purpose, and to increase my mortification, you will find I am equally compelled [416]to yield up every pretence, even to those of a negative nature, which a regard to justice has, as he says, obliged him not to omit.—These consist, as he tells us, in giving my entire approbation to the system, as to those parts which are said to endanger a trial by jury, and as to its want of a bill of rights, and in having too much candour there to signify that I thought it deficient in either of these respects:—But how, I pray can the Landholder be certain that I deserve this encomium? Is it not possible, as I so frequently exhausted the politeness of the Convention, that some of those marks of fatigue and disgust, with which he intimates I was mortified as oft as I attempted to speak, might, at that time, have taken place, and have been of such a nature as to attract his attention;—or, perhaps, as the Convention was prepared to slumber whenever I rose, the Landholder, among others, might have sunk into sleep, and at that very moment might have been feasting his imagination with the completion of his ambitious views, and dreams of future greatness:—But supposing I never did declare in Convention, that I thought the system defective in those essential points, will it amount to a positive proof that I approved the system in those respects, or that I culpably neglected an indispensable duty? Is it not possible, whatever might have been my insolence and assurance when I first took my seat, and however fond I might be at that time of obtruding my sentiments, that the many rebuffs with which I met—the repeated mortifications I experienced—the marks of fatigue and disgust with which my eyes were sure to be assailed wherever I turned them—one gaping here—another yawning there—a third slumbering in this place—and a fourth snoring in that—might so effectually have put to flight all my original arrogance, that, as we are apt to run into extremes, having at length become convinced of my comparative nothingness, in so august an assembly, and one in which the science of government was so perfectly understood, I might sink into such a state of modesty and diffidence, as not to be able to muster up resolution enough to break the seal of silence and open my lips, even after the rays of light had begun to penetrate my understanding, and in some measure to chase away those clouds of error and ignorance, in which it was enveloped on my first arrival.—Perhaps, had I been treated with a more forbearing indulgence while committing those memorable blunders, for want of a sufficient knowledge in the science of Government, I might, after the rays of light had illuminated my mind, have rendered my country much more important services, and not only assisted in raising some of the pillars, but have furnished the edifice with a new roof of my own construction, rather better calculated for the convenience and security of those who might wish to take shelter beneath it, than that which it at [417]present enjoys.—Or even admitting I was not mortified, as I certainly ought to have been, from the Landholder’s account of the matter, into a total loss of speech, was it in me, who considered the system, for a variety of reasons, absolutely inconsistent with your political welfare and happiness, a culpable neglect of duty in not endeavouring, and that against every chance of success, to remove one or two defects, when I had before ineffectually endeavoured to clear it of the others, which, therefore, I knew must remain. But to be serious; as to what relates to the appellate jurisdiction in the extent given by the system proposed, I am positive there were objections made to it, and as far as my memory will serve me, I think I was in the number of those who actually objected; but I am sure that the objections met with my approbation.7 With respect to a bill of rights—Had the government been formed upon principles truly federal, as I wished it, legislating over and acting upon the states only in their collective or political capacity, and not on individuals, there would have been no need of a bill of rights, as far as related to the rights of individuals, but only as to the rights of states:—But the proposed constitution being intended and empowered to act not only on states, but also immediately on individuals, it renders a recognition and a stipulation in favour of the rights both of states and of men, not only proper, but in my opinion, absolutely necessary.—I endeavoured to obtain a restraint on the powers of the general government, as to standing armies, but it was rejected.8 It was my wish that the general government should not have the power of suspending the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus, as it appears to me altogether unnecessary, and that the power given to it, may and will be used as a dangerous engine of oppression; but I could not succeed.9 An honourable member from South-Carolina, most anxiously sought to have a clause inserted, securing the Liberty of the Press, and repeatedly brought this subject before the Convention, but could not obtain it.10—I am almost positive he made the same attempt to have a stipulation in favour of Liberty of Conscience, but in vain.11—The more the system advanced, the more was I impressed with the necessity of not merely attempting to secure a few rights, but of digesting and forming a complete bill of rights, including those of states and of individuals, which should be assented to, and prefixed to the constitution, to serve as a barrier between the general government and the respective states and their citizens; because the more the system advanced, the more clearly it appeared to me that the framers of it did not consider that either states or men had any rights at all, or that they meant to secure the enjoyment of any to either the one or the other; accordingly, I [418]devoted a part of my time to the actually preparing and draughting such a bill of rights, and had it in readiness before I left the Convention, to have laid it before a committee.—I conversed with several members on the subject; they agreed with me on the propriety of the measure, but, at the same time, expressed their sentiments that it would be impossible to procure its adoption if attempted.—A very few days before I left the Convention, I shewed to an honourable member sitting by me, a proposition, which I then had in my hand, couched in the following words, “Resolved, that a committee be appointed to prepare and report a bill of rights, to be prefixed to the proposed constitution,” and I then would instantly have moved for the appointment of a committee for that purpose, if he would have agreed to second the motion, to do which he hesitated, not as I understood from any objection to the measure, but from a conviction in his own mind, that the motion would be in vain.12 Thus, my fellow-citizens, you see that so far from having no objections to the system on this account, while I was at Convention, I not only then thought a bill of rights necessary, but I took some pains to have the subject brought forward, which would have been done, had it not been for the difficulties I have stated:—At the same time I declare, that when I drew up the motion, and was about to have proposed it to the Convention, I had not the most distant hope it would meet with success.—The rejection of the clauses attempted in favour of particular rights, and to check and restrain the dangerous and exorbitant powers of the general government from being abused, had sufficiently taught me what to expect:—And from the best judgment I could form while in Convention, I then was, and yet remain, decidedly of the opinion, that ambition and interest had so far blinded the understanding of some of the principal framers of the constitution, that while they were labouring to erect a fabrick by which they themselves might be exalted and benefited, they were rendered insensible to the sacrifice of the freedom and happiness of the states and their citizens, which must, inevitably, be the consequence.—I most sacredly believe their object is the total abolition and destruction of all state governments, and the erection, on their ruins, of one great and extensive empire, calculated to aggrandize and elevate its rulers and chief officers, far above the common herd of mankind—to enrich them with wealth, and to encircle them with honours and glory—and which, according to my judgment, on the maturest reflection, must, inevitably, be attended with the most humiliating and abject slavery of their fellow-citizens, by the sweat of whose brows, and by the toil of whose bodies, it can only be effected:—And so anxious were its zealous promoters to hasten to a birth [419]this misshapen, heterogeneous monster of ambition and interest, that, for some time before the Convention rose, upon the least attempt to alter its form, or modify its powers, the most fretful impatience was shewn, such as would not have done much honour to a state assembly, had they been sitting as long a time, and their treasury empty; while it was repeatedly urged on the contrary, but urged in vain, that in so momentous an undertaking, in forming a system for such an extensive continent, on which the political happiness of so many millions, even to the latest ages, may depend, no time could be too long—no thought and reflection too great—and that if by continuing six months, or even as many years, we could free the system from all its errors and defects, it would be the best use to which we could possibly devote our time. Thus, my fellow-citizens, am I under the necessity of resigning again into the hands of the Landholder, all those virtues both of a positive and negative kind, which, from an excess of goodness, he bestowed upon me, and give him my full permission to dispose of them hereafter in favour of some other person, who may be more deserving, and to whom they will be more acceptable; at the same time, I must frankly acknowledge, however it may operate as a proof of my dullness and stupidity, that the “ignorance in the science of government” under which I laboured at first, was not removed by more than two months close application, under those august and enlightened masters of the science, with which the Convention abounded, nor was I able to discover during that time, either by my own researches, or by any light borrowed from those luminaries, any thing in the history of mankind, or in the sentiments of those who have favoured the world with their ideas on government, to warrant or countenance the motley mixture of a system proposed; a system which is an innovation in government of the most extraordinary kind;—a system neither wholly federal, nor wholly national—but a strange hotch-potch of both—just so much federal in appearance as to give its advocates, in some measure, an opportunity of passing it as such upon the unsuspecting multitude, before they had time and opportunity to examine it, and yet so predominantly national, as to put it in the power of its movers, whenever the machine shall be set agoing, to strike out every part that has the appearance of being federal, and to render it wholly and entirely a national government:—And if the framing and approving the constitution now offered to our acceptance, is a proof of knowledge in the science of government, I not only admit, but I glory in my ignorance; and if my rising to speak had such a somnific influence on the Convention as the Landholder represents, I have no doubt the time will come, should this system be adopted, when my countrymen will ardently wish I had never [420]left the Convention, but remained there to the last, daily administering to my associates, the salutary opiate. Happy, thrice happy, would it have been for my country, if the whole of that time had been devoted to sleep, or been a blank in our lives, rather than employed in forging its chains! As I fully intended to have returned to the Convention before the completion of its business, my colleagues very probably might, and were certainly well warranted to, give that information the Landholder mentions; but whether the Convention was led to conclude that I “would have honoured the constitution with my signature, had not indispensable business called me away,” may be easily determined after stating a few facts.—The Landholder admits I was at first against the system.—When the compromise took place on the subject of representation, I in the most explicit manner declared in Convention, that though I had concurred in the report, so far as to consent to proceed upon it, that we might see what kind of a system might be formed, yet I disclaimed every idea of being bound to give it my assent, but reserved to myself the full liberty of finally giving it my negative, if it appeared to me inconsistent with the happiness of my country.—In a desultory conversation, which long after took place in Convention, one morning before our honourable president13 took the chair, he was observing how unhappy it would be should there be such a diversity of sentiment as to cause any of the members to oppose the system when they returned to their states;—on that occasion I replied, that I was confident no state in the union would more readily accede to a proper system of government than Maryland, but that the system under consideration was of such a nature, that I never could recommend it for acceptance;—that I thought the state never ought to adopt it, and expressed my firm belief that it never would. An honourable member from Pennsylvania, objected against that part of the sixth article which requires an oath to be taken by the persons there mentioned, in support of the constitution, observing (as he justly might from the conduct the convention was then pursuing) how little such oaths were regarded:14 I immediately joined in the objection, but declared my reason to be, that I thought it such a constitution as no friend of his country ought to bind himself to support.—And not more than two days before I left Philadelphia, another honourable member from the same state, urged most strenuously that the convention ought to hasten their deliberations to a conclusion, assigning as a reason, that the assembly of Pennsylvania was just then about to meet, and that it would be of the greatest importance to bring the system before that session of the legislature, in order that a convention of the state might be [421]immediately called to ratify it, before the enemies of the system should have an opportunity of making the people acquainted with their objections, at the same time declaring that if the matter should be delayed, and the people have time to hear the variety of objections which would be made to it by its opposers, he thought it doubtful whether that state, or any state in the union, would adopt it.(a) As soon as the honourable member took his seat, I rose and observed, that I was precisely of the same opinion, that the people of America never would, nor did I think they ought to, adopt the system, if they had time to consider and understand it, whereas a proneness for novelty and change—a conviction that some alteration was necessary, and a confidence in the members who composed the Convention might possibly procure its adoption, if brought hastily before them—but that these sentiments induced me to wish that a very different line of conduct should be pursued from that recommended by the honourable member—I wished the people to have every opportunity of information, as I thought it much preferable that a bad system should be rejected at first, than hastily adopted, and afterwards be unavailingly repented of. If these were instances of my “high approbation,” I gave them in abundance, as all the Convention can testify, and continued so to do till I left them.15— That I expressed great regret at being obliged to leave Philadelphia, and a fixed determination to return, if possible, before the Convention rose, is certain—That I might declare that I had rather lose an hundred guineas than not to be there at the close of the business is very probable—and it is possible that some who heard me say this, not knowing my reasons, which could not be expressed without a breach of that secrecy to which we were enjoined, might erroneously have concluded that my motive was the gratification of vanity, in having my name enrolled with those of a Franklin and a Washington. As to the first, I cordially join in the tribute of praise so justly paid to the enlightened philosopher and statesman, while the polite friendly and affectionate treatment myself and my family received from that venerable sage, and the worthy family in which he is embosomed, will ever endear him to my heart—The name of Washington is far above my praise!—Would to Heaven that, on this occasion, one more wreath had been added to the number of those which are twined around his amiable brow!—that those with which it is already surrounded, may flourish with immortal verdure, nor wither or fade till time shall be no more, is my fervent prayer! and may that glory which encircles his head, ever shine with undiminished rays! To find myself under the necessity of opposing such illustrious characters, whom I venerated and loved, filled me with regret, but viewing [422]the system in the light I then did, and yet do view it, to have hesitated would have been criminal; complaisance would have been guilt. If it was the idea of my State, that whatever a Washington or Franklin approved, was to be blindly adopted, she ought to have spared herself the expence of sending any members to the Convention, or to have instructed them implicitly to follow where they led the way. It was not to have my “name enrolled with the other labourers,” that I wished to return to Philadelphia—that sacrifice which I must have made of my principles by putting my name to the constitution, could not have been effaced by any derivative lustre it could possibly receive from the bright constellation with which it would have been surrounded.—My object was, in truth, the very reverse, as I had uniformly opposed the system in its progress, I wished to have been present at the conclusion, to have then given it my solemn negative, which I certainly should have done, even had I stood single and alone, being perfectly willing to leave it to the cool and impartial investigation both of the present and of future ages to decide who best understood the science of government—who best knew the rights of men and of states—who best consulted the true interest of America, and who most faithfully discharged the trust reposed in them, those who agreed to, or those who opposed, the new Constitution—and so fully have I made up my own mind on this subject, that as long as the history of mankind shall record the appointment of the late Convention, and the system which has been proposed by them, it is my highest ambition that my name may be also recorded as one who considered the system injurious to my country, and as such opposed it. Having shewn that I did not “alter my opinion after I left Philadelphia,” and that I acted no “contradictory parts on the great political stage,” and, therefore, that there are none such to reconcile, the reason assigned by the Landholder for that purpose, doth not deserve my notice, except only to observe, that he shrewdly intimates there is already a junto established, who are to share in, and deal out the offices of this new government at their will and pleasure, and that they have already fixed upon the character who is to be “Deputy Attorney-General of the United States for the State of Maryland.” If this is true, it is worth while to inquire of whom this junto consists, as it might lead to a discovery of the persons, for the gratification of whose ambition and interest this system is prepared, and is, if possible, to be enforced; and from the disposition of offices already allotted in the various and numerous departments, we possibly might discover whence proceeds the conviction and zeal of some of its advocates. Baltimore, March 19, 1788. (a) How exactly agreeable to the sentiments of that honourable member has been the conduct of the friends of the constitution in Pennsylvania and some other states, I need not mention.16"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/28/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. There is, my fellow-citizens, scarcely an individual of common understanding, I believe, in this State, who is any ways acquainted with the proposed constitution, who doth not allow it to be, in many instances, extremely censurable, and that a variety of alterations and amendments are essentially requisite, to render it consistent with a reasonable security for the liberty of the respective states, and their citizens. Aristides, it is true, is an exception from this observation; he declares, that “if the whole matter was left to his discretion, he would not change [457]any part of the proposed constitution;”2—whether he meant this declaration as a proof of his discretion, I will not say; it will, however, readily be admitted, by most, as a proof of his enthusiastic zeal in favour of the system:—But it would be injustice to that writer not to observe, that if he is as much mistaken in the other parts of the constitution, as in that which relates to the judicial department,3 the constitution which he is so earnestly recommending to his countrymen, and on which he is lavishing so liberally his commendation, is a thing of his own creation, and totally different from that which is offered for your acceptance.—He has given us an explanation of the original and appellate jurisdiction of the judiciary of the general government, and of the manner in which he supposes it is to operate, an explanation so inconsistent with the intention of its framers, and so different from its true construction, and from the effect which it will have, should the system be adopted, that I could scarce restrain my astonishment at the error, although I was, in some measure, prepared for it, by his previous acknowledgment, that he did not very well understand that part of the system;4 a circumstance I apprehended he did not recollect at the time when he was bestowing upon it his dying benediction:—And if one of our judges, possessed of no common share of understanding, and of extensive acquired knowledge, who, as he informs us, has long made the science of government his peculiar study, so little understands the true import and construction of this constitution, and that too in a part more particularly within his own province, can it be wondered at that the people in general, whose knowledge in subjects of this nature is much more limited and circumscribed, should but imperfectly comprehend the extent, operation and consequences of so complex and intricate a system?—and is not this, of itself, a strong proof of the necessity that it should be corrected and amended, at least so as to render it more clear and comprehensible to those who are to decide upon it, or to be affected by it? But although almost every one agrees the constitution, as it is, to be both defective and dangerous, we are not wanting in characters who earnestly advise us to adopt it, in its present form, with all its faults, and assure us we may safely rely on obtaining, hereafter, the amendments that are necessary:—But why, I pray you, my fellow-citizens, should we not insist upon the necessary amendments being made now, while we have the liberty of acting for ourselves, before the constitution becomes binding upon us by our assent, as every principle of reason, common sense and safety would dictate?—Because, say they, the sentiments of men are so different, and the interests of the different states [458]are so jarring and dissonant, that there is no probability they would agree if alterations and amendments were attempted.—Thus, with one breath, they tell us that the obstacles to any alterations and amendments being agreed to by the states, are so insuperable, that it is vain to make the experiment, while in the next, they would persuade us it is so certain the states will accede to those which shall be necessary, and that they may be procured even after the system shall be ratified, that we need not hesitate swallowing the poison, from the ease and security of instantly obtaining the antidote; and they seem to think it astonishing that any person should find a difficulty in reconciling the absurdity and contradiction! If it is easy to obtain proper amendments, do not let us sacrifice every thing that ought to be dear to freemen, for want of insisting upon its being done, while we have the power. If the obtaining them will be difficult and improbable, for God’s sake do not accept of such a form of government, as without amendments cannot fail of rendering you mere beasts of burthen, and reducing you to a level with your own slaves, with this aggravating distinction, that you once tasted the blessings of freedom. Those who would wish you to believe that the faults in the system proposed are wholly or principally owing to the difference of state interests, and proceed from that cause, are either imposed upon themselves, or mean to impose upon you.—The principal question in which the state interests had any material effect, were those which related to representation, and the number in each branch of the legislature, whose concurrence should be necessary for passing navigation acts, or making commercial regulations.—But what state is there in the union whose interest would prompt it to give the general government the extensive and unlimited powers it possesses in the executive legislature and judicial departments, together with the powers over the militia, and the liberty of establishing a standing army without any restriction?—What state in the union considers it advantageous to its interest, that the President should be re-eligible—the members of both houses appointable to offices—the judges capable of holding other offices at the will and pleasure of the government, and that there should be no real responsibility either in the President, or in the members of either branch of the legislature?—or what state is there that would have been averse to a bill of rights, or that would have wished for the destruction of jury trial in a great variety of cases, and in a particular manner in every case, without exception, where the government itself is interested?—These parts of the system, so far from promoting the interest of any state, or states, have an immediate tendency to annihilate all the state governments [459]indiscriminately, and to subvert their rights, and the rights of their citizens.—To oppose these, and to procure their alteration, is equally the interest of every state in the union.—The introduction of these parts of the system must not be attributed to the jarring interests of states, but to a very different source—the pride, the ambition and the interest of individuals:—This being the case, we may be enabled to form some judgment of the probability of obtaining a safe and proper system, should we have firmness and wisdom to reject that which is now offered; and also of the great improbability of procuring any amendments to the present system, if we should weakly and inconsiderately adopt it. The bold and daring attempt that has been made to use, for the total annihilation of the states, that power that was delegated for their preservation, will put the different states on their guard. The votaries of ambition and interest being totally defeated in their attempt to establish themselves on the ruins of the states, which they will be, if this constitution is rejected, an attempt in which they had more probability of success from the total want of suspicion in their countrymen, than they can have hereafter; they will not hazard a second attempt of the same nature, in which they will have much less chance of success; besides, being once discovered, they will not be confided in. The true interest and happiness of the states and their citizens will, therefore, most probably, be the object, which will be principally sought for by a second convention, should a second be appointed, which, if really aimed at, I cannot think very difficult to accomplish, by giving to the federal government sufficient power for every salutary purpose, while the rights of the states and their citizens should be secure from any imminent danger.—But if the arts and influence of ambitious and interested men, even in their present situation, while more on a level with yourselves, and unarmed with any extraordinary powers, should procure you to adopt this system, dangerous as it is admitted to be to your rights, I will appeal to the understanding of every one of you, who will, on this occasion, give his reason fair-play, whether there is not every cause to believe they will, should this government be adopted, with that additional power, consequence and influence it will give them, most easily prevent the necessary alterations which might be wished for, the purpose of which would be directly opposite to their views, and defeat every attempt to procure them.—Be assured, whatever obstacles or difficulties may be at this time in the way of obtaining a proper system of government, they will be increased an hundred fold after this system is adopted. Reflect also, I entreat you, my fellow-citizens, that the alterations and amendments which are wanted in the present system, are of such a [460]nature as to diminish and lessen, to check and restrain the powers of the general government, not to increase and enlarge those powers:—If they were of the last kind, we might safely adopt it, and trust to giving greater powers hereafter, like a Physician who administers an emetick, ex re nata, giving a moderate dose at first, and increasing it afterwards as the constitution of the patient may require.—But I appeal to the history of mankind for this truth, that when once power and authority are delegated to a government, it knows how to keep it, and is sufficiently and successfully fertile in expedients for that purpose:—Nay more, the whole history of mankind proves, that so far from parting with the powers actually delegated to it, government is constantly encroaching on the small pittance of rights reserved by the people to themselves, and gradually wresting them out of their hands, until it either terminates in their slavery, or forces them to arms, and brings about a revolution. From these observations it appears to me, my fellow-citizens, that nothing can be more weak and absurd, than to accept of a system that is admitted to stand in need of immediate amendments to render your rights secure; for remember, if you fail in obtaining them, you cannot free yourselves from the yoke you will have placed on your necks, and servitude must, therefore, be your portion! Let me ask you, my fellow-citizens, what you would think of a Physician, who, because you were slightly indisposed, should bring you a dose, which properly corrected with other ingredients might be a salutary remedy, but, of itself was a deadly poison, and with great appearance of friendship and zeal, should advise you to swallow it immediately, and trust to accident for those requisites necessary to qualify its malignity, and prevent its destructive effects?—Would not you reject the advice, in however friendly a manner it might appear to be given, with indignation, and insist that he should first procure, and properly attemper, the necessary ingredients, since after the fatal draught was once received into your bowels, it would be too late, should the antidote prove unattainable, and death must ensue?—With the same indignation ought you, my fellow-citizens, to reject the advice of those political quacks, who, under pretence of healing the disorders of our present government, would urge you rashly to gulp down a constitution, which, in its present form, unaltered and unamended, would be as certain death to your liberty, as arsenick could be to your bodies. Baltimore, March 25, 1788."
Broadside,No,Luther Martin,,,,3/30/1788,"The following sheets contain the information given by me to the legislature of Maryland, when officially called before them for that purpose:—No friend to his country will think that they require an apology; I should have been unworthy the trust reposed in me, and guilty of the blackest ingratitude to a State, which has given me the most distinguishing marks of its confidence, had I not been explicit.—No fact has been intentionally mis[s]tated by me, I aimed to be perfectly correct; and, though in some measure obliged to depend on my memory, I believe I have in no instance, given malice an opportunity to charge me with misrepresentation. No writer, with his name, has denied the information to be just—I think they never will—though we differ in politics, should it be necessary, there are men of honor who were in the convention, who are ready to decide in my favour; and I can, with confidence, appeal to a Washington, a Franklin, and other respectable members of the convention, for the veracity of my information. Few, very few, even of the anonymous publications have insinuated the information to be in any respect uncandid; and those few have confined themselves to generals, without daring to descend to particulars.—The lowest scurrility in the form of Extracts of letters, coined at the mint of meanness and falsehood, I have experienced; it is what I expected; I know myself, and I am known by others, to be infinitely above them, and have read them with a smile of contempt.—Me they cannot injure;—but they disgrace their authors, and the cause in which they are engaged.—This is a trifling sacrifice—In the cause of freedom, were it necessary, I am ready to make a much greater. As far as I have expressed my opinions of the views of the framers of the constitution, I have followed the fullest conviction of my mind, founded on my own observations made on their conduct while in convention, and confirmed by the conduct of the friends of the system since that time.—They were my sentiments while there; I at that time expressed them freely, and then found many who perfectly corresponded with me in sentiment, although some of them may not now choose to avow it, or, no doubt from a conviction of their error, may now advocate the system they there condemned and opposed. But as to myself, so far from having any reason to change the opinion I there formed, every circumstance which has since taken place has confirmed it. The conduct adopted by the convention, rendered the dissemination of these sheets the more necessary: Could there possibly be a greater indignity and insult offered to the majesty of the free States, and the free citizens of America, than for the very men who were entrusted with powers for the preservation and security of their rights, and for the establishment of a permanent system to promote their happiness, to make use of that power to destroy both the one and the other?—For this purpose, in time of profound peace, to shut themselves up in mystery and darkness; to keep all their deliberations an absolute secret from their constituents, who were to be affected thereby; to prevent the publication of their journals; to deprive the free citizens of America of every means of information: to attempt to pass upon them, as meeting with their unanimous approbation, that which did not in reality meet with the perfect approbation of perhaps one individual in the convention; to give you no other alternative but to accept of it as proposed, without alteration, or to reject it entirely, while at the same time some of them were resounding, from one end of the continent to the other, the necessity of its acceptance, and that none but the enemies of their country would reject it—And to abuse your confidence in them, by endeavouring to hurry you into a hasty adoption, under that delusion, before you could obtain information, and be able to form a proper judgement for yourselves. Such a conduct in any other country, or even in this, at any other time, would have drawn down upon them the indignation and resentment of those who were thus attempted to be abused and enslaved. To counteract the views of ambition and interest has been my aim—To this I devoted every effort while in convention—The same motives have directed my conduct since—Should my exertions in the smallest degree assist in effecting the rejection of this detestable system of slavery, I shall enjoy the highest possible gratification, that of rendering my country an essential benefit. But should the system be adopted, I shall even then enjoy the highest possible consolation which a good citizen can enjoy in the public calamity, that of having conscientiously discharged my duty to my country, by endeavouring to avert it. Baltimore, March 30, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,4/4/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. If those, my fellow-citizens, to whom the administration of our government was about to be committed, had sufficient wisdom never to err, and sufficient goodness always to consult the true interest of the governed,—and if we could have a proper security that their successors should to the end of time be possessed of the same qualifications, it would be impossible that power could be lavished upon them with too liberal a hand. Power absolute and unlimited, united with unerring wisdom and unbounded goodness, is the government of the Deity over the universe!—But remember, my fellow-citizens, that the persons to whom you are about to delegate authority, are and will be weak, erring mortals, subject to the same passions, prejudices and infirmities with yourselves; and let it be deeply engraven on your hearts, that from the first history [481]of government to the present time, if we begin with Nimrod, and trace down the rulers of nations to those who are now invested with supreme power, we shall find few, very few, who have made the beneficent Governor of the Universe the model of their conduct, while many are they who, on the contrary, have imitated the demons of darkness. We have no right to expect that our rulers will be more wise, more virtuous, or more perfect than those of other nations have been, or that they will not be equally under the influence of ambition, avarice, and all that train of baleful passions, which have so generally proved the curse of our unhappy race. We must consider mankind such as they really are,—such as experience has shewn them to be heretofore, and bids us expect to find them hereafter, and not suffer ourselves to be misled by interested deceivers or enthusiastick visionaries; and therefore in forming a system of government, to delegate no greater power than is clearly and certainly necessary, ought to be the first principle with every people, who are influenced by reason and a regard for their safety, and in doing this, they ought most solicitously to endeavour so to qualify even that power, by such checks and restraints, as to produce a perfect responsibility in those who are to exercise it, and prevent them from its abuse with a chance of impunity;—since such is the nature of man, that he has a propensity to abuse authority and to tyrannize over the rights of his fellow-men;—and to whomsoever power is given, not content with the actual deposite, they will ever strive to obtain an increase. Those who would wish to excite and keep awake your jealousy and distrust, are your truest friends;—while they, who speak peace to you when there is no peace—who would lull you into security, and wish you to repose blind confidence in your future governors, are your most dangerous enemies.—Jealousy and distrust are the guardian angels who watch over liberty:—security and confidence are the forerunners of slavery. But the advocates for the system tell you that we who oppose it, endeavour to terrify you with mere possibilities, which may never be realized, that all our objections consist in saying government may do this,—and government may do that.— I will, for argument sake, admit the justice of this remark, and yet maintain that the objections are insurmountable.—I consider it an incontrovertible truth, that whatever by the constitution government even may do, if it relates to the abuse of power, by acts tyrannical and oppressive, it some time or other will do.—Such is the ambition of man, and his lust for domination, that no power less than that which fixed [482]its bounds to the ocean, can say, to them, “thus far shall ye go and no farther.”2—Ascertain the limits of the may, with ever so much precision, and let them be as extensive as you please, government will speedily reach their utmost verge; nor will it stop there, but soon will overleap those boundaries, and roam at large into the regions of the may not.—Those who tell you the government by this constitution may keep up a standing army,—abolish the trial by jury,—oppress the citizens of the states by its powers over the militia,—destroy the freedom of the press,—infringe the liberty of conscience, and do a number of other acts injurious to and destructive of your rights, yet that it never will do so; and that you safely may accept such a constitution, and be perfectly at ease and secure that your rulers will always be so good, so wise, and so virtuous—such emanations of the Deity, that they will never use their power but for your interest and your happiness—contradict the uniform experience of ages, and betray a total ignorance of human nature, or a total want of ingenuity. Look back, my fellow-citizens, to your conduct but a few years past, and let that instruct you what ought to be your conduct at this time. Great-Britain then claimed the right to pass laws to bind you in all cases whatever.3—You were then told in all the soft insinuating language of the present day, and with all the appearance of disinterested friendship now used, that those who insisted this claim of power might be abused, only wandered in the regions of fancy—that you need not be uneasy, but might safely acquiesce in the claim—that you might have the utmost possible confidence in your rulers, that they never would use that power to your injury;—but distrustful of government, and jealous of your liberty, you rejected such counsel with disdain;—the bare possibility that Britain might abuse it, if once conceded, kindled a flame from one end of this continent to the other, and roused you to arms—Weak and defenceless as you were, unused to military exertions, and unsupplied with warlike stores, you braved the strength of a nation the most powerful and best provided—you chose to risk your lives and property rather than to risque the possibility that the power claimed by the British government should be exercised to your injury—a possibility, which the minions of power at that time, with as much confidence as those of the present day, declared to be absolutely visionary. Heaven wrought a miracle in your favour, and your efforts were crowned with success. You are not now called upon to make an equal sacrifice—you are not now requested to beat your ploughshares into swords, or your pruning hooks into spears4—to leave your peaceful habitations, and exchange domestic tranquility for the horrors of war;—peaceably, quietly [483]and orderly to give this system of slavery your negative, is all that is asked by the advocates of freedom—to pronounce the single monosyllable no, is all they entreat;—shall they entreat you in vain?—when by this it is to be determined, whether our independence, for obtaining which we have been accustomed to bow the knee with reverential gratitude to Heaven, shall be our greatest curse;—and when on this it depends whether we shall be subjected to a government, of which the little finger will be thicker than the loins of that of Great-Britain.5 But there are also persons who pretend that your situation is at present so bad, that it cannot be worse, and urge that as an argument why we should embrace any remedy proposed, however desperate it may appear. Thus do the poor erring children of mortality, suffering under the presence of real or imaginary evils, have recourse to a pistol or halter for relief, and rashly launch into the untried regions of eternity—nor wake from their delusion, until they wake in endless wo[e].—Should the citizens of America, in a fit of desperation, be induced to commit this fatal act of political suicide, to which by such arguments they are stimulated, the day will come when labouring under more than Egyptian bondage, compelled to furnish their quota of brick, though destitute of straw and of mortar;6 galled with your chains, and worn down by oppression, you will, by sad experience, be convinced (when that conviction shall be too late) that there is a difference in evils, and that the buzzing of gnats is more supportable than the sting of a serpent. From the wisdom of antiquity we might obtain excellent instruction, if we were not too proud to profit by it—Aesop has furnished us with the history of a nation of Frogs7—between which and our own there is a most striking resemblance.—Whether the catastrophe shall be the same, rests with ourselves. Jupiter, out of pure good nature, wishing to do them as little injury as possible, on being asked for a King, had thrown down into their pond a Log to rule over them;—under whose government, had they been wise enough to know their own interest and to pursue it, they might, to this day, have remained happy and prosperous.—Terrified with the noise, and affrighted by the violent undulations of the water, they for some time kept an awful distance, and regarded their monarch with reverence; but the first impression being in some measure worn off, and perceiving him to be of a tame and peaceable disposition, they approached him with familiarity, and soon entertained for him the utmost contempt:—In a little time were seen the leaders of the Frogs croaking, to their respective circles, on the weakness and feebleness of the government at home, and of its want of dignity and respect abroad, [484]till the sentiment being caught by their auditors, the whole pond resounded with “Oh Jupiter, good Jupiter, hear our prayers—take away from us this vile Log, and give us a ruler who shall know how to support the dignity and splendor of government!—give us any government you please, only let it be energetic and efficient.”—The Thunderer, in his wrath, sent them a Crane. With what delight did they gaze on their Monarch, as he came majestically floating on the wings of the wind!—They admired his uncommon shape—it was such as they had never before seen—his deformities were, in their eyes, the greatest of beauties—and they were heard, like Aristides, to declare, that, were they on the verge of eternity, they would not wish a single alteration in his form8—His monstrous beak, his long neck, and his enormous poke—even these, the future means of their destruction, were subjects of their warm approbation.—He took possession of his new dominions, and instantly began to swallow down his subjects; and it is said, that those who had been the warmest zealots for Crane-administration, fared no better than the rest.—The poor wretches were now much more dissatisfied than before, and, with all possible humility, applied to Jupiter again for his aid, but in vain—he dismissed them with this reproof, “that the evil of which they complained, they had foolishly brought upon themselves, and that they had no other remedy now, but to submit with patience.”—Thus forsaken by the God, and left to the mercy of the Crane, they sought to escape his cruelty by flight; but pursuing them to every place of retreat, and thrusting his long neck through the water to the bottom, he drew them out with his beak from their most secret hiding-places, and served them up as a regale for his ravenous appetite. The present federal government is, my fellow-citizens, the Log of the fable—the Crane is the system now offered to your acceptance.—I wish you not to remain under the government of the one, nor to become subjected to the tyranny of the other.—If either of these events take place, it must arise from your being greatly deficient to yourselves, from your being, like the nation of Frogs, “a discontented, variable race, weary of liberty, and fond of change.”—At the same time I have no hesitation in declaring, that if the one or the other must be our fate, I think the harmless, inoffensive, though contemptible Log, infinitely to be preferred to the powerful, the efficient, but all-devouring Crane. Baltimore, March 29, 1788."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Samuel Adams,,,4/28/1788,"Your favour of December 3d, in the last year,2 reached me the last of January following, and it should have been answered with my thanks long since, if the uncommon badness of the winter, stopping all communication, had not prevented. Your sentiments on the new political structure, are, in my mind, strong and just. Both reason and experience prove, that so extensive a territory as that of the United States, including such a variety of climates, productions, interests; and so great difference of manners, habits, and customs; cannot be governed in freedom—until formed into states, sovereign, sub modo, and confederated for the common good. In the latter case, opinion founded on the knowledge of those who govern, procures obedience without force. But remove the opinion, which must fall with a knowledge of characters in so widely extended a country, and force then becomes necessary to secure the purposes of civil government; hence the military array at Kamtschatka, at Petersburg, and through every part of the widely extended Russian empire.3 Thus force, the parent and the support of tyranny, is demanded for good purposes, although for ever abused to bad ones—that a consolidated, and not a federal government, was the design of some, who formed this new project, I have no doubt about. The dazzling ideas of glory, wealth, and power uncontrolled, unfettered by popular opinions, are powerful to captivate the ambitious and the avaricious. With such people, obedience resulting from fear, the offspring of force, is preferable to obedience flowing from esteem and confidence, the legitimate offspring of the knowledge that men have of wisdom and virtue in their governors; and, above all, from the conviction that abuses may be rectified by the substantial checks that political freedom furnish. Massachusetts, I see, has adopted the plan; but proposes to insist perseveringly on amendments.4 If it were permitted an individual to question so enlightened an assembly, I would ask, why submit to a system requiring such amendments, and trust to creatures of our own creation, for the correcting of evils in it that threaten the destruction of those ends for which the system was formed? The fear of greater evils has been stated: but I cannot help considering such fears as being generated by design upon weakness. [766]The objections to the present system, if accurately considered, will, I believe, be found to grow out of those temporary pressures, created by a long and expensive war, which time and prudence may remove. But, though it were admitted that some amendments to the present confederation would better promote the ends designed by it, why, for that reason, exterminate the present plan, and establish on its ruins another, so replete with power, danger, and hydra-headed mischief? The Massachusetts amendments are good, so far as they go. The first, third, and fourth amendments are well contrived to keep in existence the state sovereignties; and the first particularly proper for securing liberty from the abuse of construction, which the new plan most amply admits of. But why, my dear friend, was the provision in your seventh proposition of amendment, confined to causes between citizens of different states, since the reason applies to suitors of every country, and foreigners will be more apt than our own citizens to abuse, in the way, which, that part of the proffered plan permits, and which this amendment of Massachusetts is designed to prevent? England and Scotland are united for every good purpose of defence and offence, yet a foreigner cannot sue a resident Scotsman in England for debt contracted in Scotland: nor will any foreign nation upon earth grant a similar privilege to our citizens over theirs, of calling their people from their own countries to answer demands against them—the fixt idea of all the European nations being, that strangers are not to have privileges in their own country superior to what their own subjects enjoy."
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,George Mason,,,5/7/1788,"Your son delivered me the letter that you were pleased to write me on the 30th instant,2 and I have promoted his views, as far as it is in my power at present, by directing the tobacco I had intended to sell in the country, to be put on board his vessel. I am inclined to think, for the reasons assigned by him, that the French market will be as good a one, at least, as any that we can send to. Give me leave now, dear sir, to make a few observations on the important business that will call you to Richmond next month. It seems pretty clear at present, that four other States, viz. North Carolina, New York, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, will depend much upon Virginia for their determination on the Convention project of a new constitution; therefore it becomes us to be very circumspect and careful [785]about the conduct we pursue, as, on the one hand, every possible exertion of wisdom and firmness should be employed to prevent danger to civil liberty, so, on the other hand, the most watchful precaution should take place to prevent the foes of union, order, and good government, from succeeding so far as to prevent our acceptance of the good part of the plan proposed. I submit to you, sir, whether, to form a consistent union of conduct, it would not be well for six or eight leading friends to amendments to meet privately,3 and, having formed the best possible judgment of the members’ sentiments from knowledge of the men, to see how far it may be safe to press either for modes of amendment or the extent of amendments, and to govern accordingly. But, certainly, the firmest stand should be made against the very arbitrary mode that has been pursued in some states, that is, to propose a question of absolute rejection or implicit admission. For though it is true that the convention plan looks something like this, yet I think every temperate man must agree that neither the convention, nor any set of men upon earth, have or had a right to insist upon such a question of extremity. To receive the good and reject the bad is too necessary and inherent a right to be parted with. As some subtle managers will be upon the convention, I believe you will find entrapping questions proposed at first as a ground-work of proceeding, which will hamper, confine, and narrow all attempts to proper investigation or necessary amendment, and this will be done under the plausible pretext of losing all by attempting any change. I judge that it will be so here, because I observe a similar conduct has been pursued in other places, as in Maryland and Pennsylvania. I trust that such uncandid and dangerous stratagems will be opposed and prevented in the convention of Virginia, and a thorough, particular, and careful examination be first made into all its parts as a previous requisite to the formation of any question upon it. During this process a tolerable judgment may be formed of the sentiments of the generality, and a clue furnished for forming successful propositions for amendment, as the candid friends to this system admit that amendments may be made to improve the plan, but say that these amendments ought to be made, and may be obtained from the new Congress without endangering a total loss of the proposed constitution. I say that those who talk thus, if they are sincere, will not object to this plan, which, as I propose it, [is] something like the proceeding of the convention parliament in 1688, in the form of ratification, insert plainly and strongly such amendments as can be agreed upon, and say, that the people of Virginia do claim, demand, and insist upon these as their undoubted rights and liberties which they mean not to part with; and if these are not [786]obtained and secured by the mode pointed out in the fifth article of the convention plan, in two years after the meeting of the new Congress, that Virginia shall, in that case, be considered as disengaged from this ratification. Under this proposition a development will be made of the sincerity of those who advocate the new plan, the beneficial parts of it retained, and a just security given to civil liberty. In the fifth article it is stated that two-thirds of Congress may propose amendments, which, being approved by three-fourths of the legislatures, become parts of the constitution. By this mode, the new Congress may obtain our amendments without risking the convulsion of conventions, and the friends of the plan will be gratified in what they say is necessary; the putting the government in motion, when, as they again say, amendments may and ought to be obtained. By this mode, too, in all probability, the undetermined States may be brought to harmonize, and the formidable minorities, in the assenting states, may be quieted. By this friendly and reasonable accommodation, the perpetual distrust and opposition, that will inevitably follow the total adoption of the plan, from the state legislatures, may be happily prevented, and friendly united exertions take place. Much reflection has convinced me that this mode is the best that I have had an opportunity of contemplating. I have, therefore, taken the liberty of recommending it to your serious and patriotic attention; in the formation of these amendments, localities ought to be avoided as much as possible. The danger of monopolized trade may be prevented by calling for the consent of three-fourths of the United States on regulations of trade. The trial by jury, in this state, to be insisted on, as it [is] used under our present government, and confining the supreme federal court to the jurisdiction of law excluding fact. The Massachusetts amendments, except the second, and extending the seventh to foreigners as well as citizens of other States, appear to me to be very good, and for their adoption the aid of that powerful state may be secured.4 The freedom of the press is, by no means, sufficiently attended to by Massachusetts, nor have they remedied the want of responsibility by the impolitic combination of president and senate. It does appear to me, that, in the present temper of America, if the Massachusetts amendments, with those suggested by me,5 being added, and inserted in our ratification as before stated, we may easily agree, and I verily believe that the most essential good consequences would be the result. Affectionately yours,"
Letter,Yes,George Mason,Thomas Jefferson,,,5/26/1788,"… I make no Doubt that You have long ago received Copys of the new Constitution of Government, framed last Summer, by the Delegates of the several States, in general Convention at Philadelphia.—Upon the most mature Consideration I was capable of, and from Motives of sincere Patriotism, I was under the Necessity of refusing my Signature, as one of the Virginia Delegates; and drew up some general Objections; which I intended to offer, by Way of Protest; but was discouraged from doing so, by the precipitate, & intemperate, not to say indecent Manner, in which the Business was conducted, during the last week of the Convention, after the Patrons of this new plan found they had a decided Majority in their Favour;2 which was obtained by [883]a Compromise between the Eastern, & the two Southern States, to permit the latter to continue the Importation of Slaves for twenty odd Years; a more favourite Object with them, than the Liberty and Happiness of the People.3— These Objections of mine were first printed very incorrectly, without my Approbation, or Privity; which laid me under some kind of Necessity of publishing them afterwards, myself.—I take the Liberty of enclosing You a Copy of them.4 You will find them conceived in general Terms; as I wished to confine them to a narrow compass.—There are many other things very objectionable in the proposed new Constitution; particularly the almost unlimited Authority over the Militia of the several States; whereby, under Colour of regulating, they may disarm, or render useless the Militia, the more easily to govern by a standing Army; or they may harrass the Militia, by such rigid Regulations, and intolerable Burdens, as to make the People themselves desire it’s Abolition.—By their Power over the Elections, they may so order them, as to deprive the People at large of any Share in the Choice of their Representatives.—By the Consent of Congress, Men in the highest Offices of Trust in the United States may receive any Emolument, Place, or Pension from a forreign Prince, or Potentate; which is setting themselves up to the highest Bidder.—But it would be tedious to enumerate all the Objections; and I am sure they cannot escape Mr. Jefferson’s Observation.—Delaware—Pensylvania—Jersey—Connecticut—Georgia, and Maryland have ratifyed the new Government (for surely it is not a Confederation) without Amendments—Massachusets has accompanyed the Ratification with proposed Amendments—Rhode Island has rejected it—New Hampshire, after some Deliberation, adjourned their Convention to June—The Convention of South Carolina is now sitting—The Convention of new York meets in June—that of North Carolina in July—and the Convention of Virginia meets on the first Monday in June. I shall set out for Richmond this week, in order to attend it.—From the best Information I have had, the Members of the Virginia Convention are so equally divided upon the Subject, that no Man can, at present, form any certain Judgement of the Issue. There seems to be a great Majority for Amendments; but many are for ratifying first, and amending afterwards. This Idea appears to me so utterly absurd, that I can not think any Man of Sense candid, in Proposing it.…"
Letter,No,Richard Henry Lee,Edmund Pendleton,,,5/26/1788,"The manner in which we have together struggled for the just rights of human nature, with the friendly correspondence that we have maintained, entitles us, I hope, to the most unreserved confidence in each other upon the subject of human rights and the liberty of our country. ⟨It is probable that yourself, no more than I do, propose to be hereafter politically engaged; neither therefore expecting to gain or fearing to loose, the candid part of mankind will admit us to be impartial Judges, at least of the arduous business that calls you to Richmond on the 2d. of next month.⟩2 I do not recollect to have met with a sensible and candid Man who has not admitted that it would be both safer and better if amendments were made to the Constitution proposed for the government of the U. States; but the friends to the idea of amendments divide about the mode of obtaining them—Some thinking that a second Convention might do the business, whilst others fear that the attempt to remedy by another Convention would risk the whole. I have been informed that you wished Amendments, but disliked the plan of another Convention. The just weight that you have Sir in the Councils of your Country may put it in your power to save from Arbitrary Rule a great and free people. I have used the words Arbitrary Rule because great numbers fear that this will be the case, when they consider that it may be so under the new proposed System, and reflect on the unvarying progress of power in the hands of frail Man. To accomplish the ends of Society by being equal to Contingencies infinite, demands the deposit of power great and extensive indeed in the hands of Rulers. So great, as to render abuse probable, unless prevented by the most careful precautions: among which, the freedom & frequency of elections, the liberty of the Press, the Trial by Jury, and the Independency of the Judges, seem to be so capital & essential; that they ought to be [879]secured by a Bill of Rights to regulate the discretion of Rulers in a legal way, restraining the progress of Ambition & Avarice within just bounds. Rulers must act by subordinate Agents generally, and however the former may be secure from the pursuits of Justice, the latter are forever kept in Check by the trial by Jury where that exists “in all its Rights”. This most excellent security against oppression, is an universal, powerful and equal protector of all. But the benefit to be derived from this System is most effectually to be obtained from a well informed and enlightened people. Here arrises the necessity for the freedom of the Press, which is the happiest Organ of communication ever yet devised, the quickest & surest means of conveying intelligence to the human Mind. I am grieved to be forced to think, after the most mature consideration of the subject, that the proposed Constitution leaves the three essential Securities before stated, under the mere pleasure of the new Rulers! And why should it be so Sir, since the violation of these cannot be necessary to good government, but will be always extremely convenient for bad. It is a question deserving intense consideration, whether the State Sovereignties ought not to be supported, perhaps in the way proposed by Massachusetts in their 1st. 3d. & 4th Amendments.3 Force & Opinion seem to be the two ways alone by which Men can be governed—the latter appears the most proper for a free people—but remove that and obedience, I apprehend, can only be found to result from fear the Offspring of force. If this be so, can Opinion exist ⟨among the great Mass of Mankind⟩ without compitent knowledge of those who govern, and can that knowledge take place in a Country so extensive as the territory of the U. States which is stated by Capt. Hutchins4 at a Million of square miles, whilst the empire of Germany contains but 192,000, and the kingdom of France but 163,000 square miles. The almost infinite variety of climates, Soils, productions, manners, customs & interests renders this still more difficult for the general government of one Legislature; but very practicable to Confederated States united for mutual safety & happiness, each contributing to the federal head such a portion of its sovereignty as would render the government fully adequate to these purposes and No more. The people would govern themselves more easily, the laws of each State being well adapted to its own genius and circumstances; the liberties of the U. States would probably be more secure than under the proposed plan, which, carefully attended to will be found capable of annihilating the State Sovereignties by finishing the operations of their State governments under the general Legislative right of commanding Taxes without restraint. So that the productive Revenues that the States may [880]happily fall upon for their own support can be seized by superior power supported by the Congressional Courts of Justice, and by the sacred obligation of Oath imposed on all the State Judges to regard the laws of Congress as sup[reme?] over the laws and Constitutions of the States! Thus circumst[anced we?] shall probably find resistance vain, and the State governments as feeble and contemptible as was the Senatorial power under the Roman Emperors—The name existed but the thing was gone. I have observed Sir that the sensible and candid friends of the proposed plan agree that amendments would be proper, but fear the consequences of another Convention. I submit the following as an effectual compromise between the Majorities, and the formidable Minorities that generally prevail. It seems probable that the determinations of four States5 will be materially influenced by what Virginia shall do—This places a strong obligation on our country to be unusually cautious and circumspect in our Conventional conduct. The Mode that I would propose is something like that pursued by the Convention Parliament of England in 1688.6 In our Ratification insert plainly and strongly such amendments as can be agreed upon, and say; that the people of Virginia do insist upon and mean to retain them as their undoubted rights and liberties which they intend not to part with; and if these are not obtained and secured by the Mode pointed out in the 5th. article of the Convention plan in two years after the meeting of the new Congress, that Virginia shall be considered as disengaged from this Ratification. In the 5th. article it is stated that two thirds of Congress may propose amendments, which being approved by three fourths of the Legislatures become parts of the Constitution—So that the new Congress may obtain the amendments of Virginia without risking the convulsion of Conventions. Thus the beneficial parts of the new System may be retained, and a just security be given for Civil Liberty; whilst the friends of the System will be gratified in what they say is necessary, to wit, the putting the government in motion, when, as they again say, amendments may and ought to be made. The good consequences resulting from this method will probably be, that the undetermined States may be brought to harmonize, and the formidable minorities in many assenting States be quieted by so friendly and reasonable an accommodation. In this way may be happily prevented the perpetual opposition that will inevitably follow (the total adoption of the plan) from the State Legislatures; and united exertions take place. In the formation of these amendments Localities ought to be avoided as much as possible. The danger of Monopolized Trade may be avoided by calling for the consent of 3 fourths of the U. States on regulations of Commerce. The [881]trial by Jury to be according to the course of proceeding in the State where the cause criminal or civil is tried, and confining the Supreme federal Court to the jurisdiction of Law excluding Fact. To prevent surprises, and the fixing of injurious laws, it would seem to be prudent to declare against the making [perpetual?] laws until the experience of two years at least shall have [vouched?] their utility. It being much more easy to get a good Law [continued?] than a bad one repealed. The amendments of Massachusetts [appear?] to be good so far as they go, except the 2d. and extending the 7th. [to?] foreigners as well as the Citizens of other States in this Union.7 For th[eir?] adoption the aid of that powerful State may be secured. The freedom of the Press is by no means sufficiently attended to by Massachusetts, nor have they remedied the want of responsibility by the impolitic combination of President & Senate. ⟨No person, I think, can be alarmed at that part of the above proposition which proposes our discharge if the requisite Amendments are not made; because, in all human probability it will be the certain means of securing their adoption for the following reasons—N.C. N.Y. R.I. & N.H. are the 4 States that are to determine after Virginia, and there being abundant reason to suppose that they will be much influenced by our determination; if they, or 3 of them join us, I presume it cannot be fairly imagined that the rest, suppose 9, will hesitate a moment to make Amendments which are of general nature, clearly for the safety of Civil Liberty against the future designs of despotism to destroy it; and which indeed is requir’d by at least half of most of those States who have adopted the new Plan; and which finally obstruct not good but bad government.⟩ It does appear to me, that in the present temper of America, if the Massachusetts amendments, with those herein suggested being added, & were inserted in the form of our ratification as before stated, that Virginia may safely agree, and I believe that the most salutary consequences would ensue. ⟨I am sure that America and the World too look with anxious expectations at us, if we change the Liberty that we have so well deserved for elective Despotism we shall suffer the evils of the change while we labor under the contempt of Mankind⟩—I pray Sir that God may bless the Convention with wisdom, maturity of Counsel, and constant care of the public liberty; and that he may have you in his holy keeping. ⟨I find that as usual, I have written to you a long letter—but you are good and the subject is copious—I like to reason with a reasonable Man, but I disdain to notice those Scribblers in the Newspapers altho they have honored me with their abuse—My attention to them will never exist whilst there is a Cat or a Spaniel in the House!⟩"
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,5/28/1788,"I have in a former paper endeavored to take a view of the leading principles of the new federal constitution.1 In pursuing the design of that address it was necessary to make some previous remarks on the nature of civil government in general: This led me to premise the material discrimination between arbitrary constitutions and the constitution of free governments. The arbitrary species, or those, which fix no other limits to the [886]supreme rulers, but their own wills, are totally incompatible with the spirit of civil liberty, and exclude every idea of free government. These may be described by the harsher epithet of despotism. Some men may perhaps fancy a distinction where in reality none exists. They may conceive the possibility of a government being constituted, which may with great propriety be denominated arbitrary; and yet consider it not as despotic. If, however, it be recollected that the term despotism is a relative expression arising from the authority of masters over their servants, which authority is founded in the will of the masters, it must plainly appear that every degree of arbitrary power is despotic; and that tyranny in government, whether it be distinguished by the former, or by the latter, appellation, is its regular and natural production. For whenever a power becomes vested in any agent, as unrestrained as the will of that agent, in him are immediately created the properties of a master; and those, over whom he exercises such power, stand ipso facto in the relation of servants. To some the bare mention of despotic rule conveys the most alarming ideas of horror; yet at the same time are they satisfied with the gentler operations, as they imagine, of some species of arbitrary sway. With [– – –] of zeal they urge the expediency of a plan, which has for its basis the extended sphere of human will. They contend that it is necessary to establish a system, so unrestrained in its nature, in order to effectuate a strong and energetic government. This desirable object they seem to consider as unattainable by any other means;—and that all institutions, which convey only a limited authority, are inadequate to the purposes of society. Such a kind of responsibility, as would form a check on the supreme rulers, is deemed a source of continual impediment; and—to secure any degree of natural liberty, however small a residuum, is, in contemplation of their minds, laying the foundation of a weak government, liable to endless confusions, and productive of nothing better than sedition and anarchy. They conceive a fondness for this species of government, because it is framed in the republican stile; and, although fraught with the seeds of despotism, the apparent loveliness of its outward garb hides all the deformity of its inward corruptions. Whence it is manifest that distinctions are formed, which are preposterous and merely imaginary. Nothing, perhaps, has contributed more towards interrupting the repose of mankind than a curious attention to the names and shadows of things, whilst the real essence and substantial parts have been disregarded. That, which in any particular form has once produced much evil [887]and discontent, generally stamps a lasting impression on the mind, and is not contemplated but with extreme detestation; although evils of the same nature, when inflicted under a different appearance, are frequently submitted to without repining. Thus, after the expulsion of Tarquin, and with him the extinction of regal authority in Rome, the name of King was ever odi[o]us to the Roman people; yet did they acquiesce in the exercise of arbitrary transactions under a different form of government. Such were they frequently subjected to through the various stages of their republic; until at last the sovereign power was established in the person of a single man. This change produced a system of government, unbounded as the regal sway, and no less susceptible of tyrannical proceedings. They could then respect the name of emperor, unlimited as he was, and, though exposed to all the rage of oppression, bow down with reverence, and venerate the imperial scepter. The insidious attempts under a British administration to pervert the former government into a baneful system of tyranny had spread a general alarm throughout America. Opposition to arbitrary measures manifested itself among all ranks of people. Diligent enquiries were made to [expose?] the schemes of their enemies; jealousies excited to an unusual degree with respect to their rights and privileges;—whilst exertions were made, which produced the most desirable effects. All these circumstances conspired in exhibiting very favorable prospects, and promised a lasting security to American liberty. The injuries suffered under a government, which exposed the people of these states to the machinations of wicked and designing ministers, determined them in the choice of a system, which had principally in view the preservation of their liberty. Such was its grand object. In pursuit of this plan, as the great means of national happiness, constitutions were formed for the different states upon principles, salutary in their nature, and tending to perpetuate the freedom and independency of each. To these was added a confederation, under which the separate republics so constituted might harmonize in all their general interests. Thus were they situated—when a defect was apprehended in this confederation. The ineffectual endeavors to promote some important advantages, and to answer all the exigenc[i]es of the union, indicated a weakness in the general government. A revision was deemed expedient. When, therefore, a new constitution was proposed, it became the duty of every American diligently to enquire, first, whether this system was coincident with their standing maxims of liberty; and, if so—whether conducive to good policy. If found derogatory to the former—any [888]consideration respecting the latter should be unnecessary. This alone should mark it, as dangerous, and unworthy of approbation. The genius of America [– – –] [– – –] [– – –] [– – –] that no fancied schemes of policy should compensate for the adoption of a plan discordant to her favorite principles of liberty. This is not a chimerical illusion, but a solid and interesting consideration. A mind thus convicted must act inconsistent with propriety, and contrary to every sentiment of duty, if it would then approve of the plan. The writer of this address had, therefore, in his first number chiefly intended to take up this matter only so far as related to its principles—and having conceived that these were incompatible with the admired maxims of American liberty, his objections on that head were there laid down. Observing, however, that most of the writers in favor of the plan seem in a great measure to have passed over this important point—and recommend it merely from motives of policy; it is now intended, as the business of some succeeding papers,2 to state objections to such of the constituent parts of the plan, abstracted of its principles, as appear, in his opinion, improperly constructed, and calculated to produce ill effects in their operation. These writers seem not to regard any fundamentals in government, provided they can procure a plan, in which they fancy some prospects of immediate benefit are to be discovered. In conformity with the stile of the proposed constitution, the favorers of it have, with a peculiarity of self-applause, ascribed to themselves the distinction of federalists; while those, who oppose the plan are marked with the epithet of anti-federal. The strong desire, which has been manifested, for a union between the American states, since the revolution, affords an opportunity of making the distinction, as they imagine, to their advantage.—As federalists, in their opinion, they must be deemed friendly to the union:—as anti-federal, the opposers must, in their opinion too, be considered unfriendly. Thus on the sound of names they build their fame. For those gentlemen, however, let it be observed that the opponents seem to act on the broader scale of true federal principles. The advocates for the new code wish all sovereignty to be lodged in the hands of Congress. This is not to connect thirteen independent states—but to form one extended empire by compounding the whole, and thus destroying the sovereignty of each. The other party desire a continuance of each distinct sovereignty—and are anxious for such a degree of energy in the general government, as will cement the union in the [889]strongest manner. This they consider as one of the greatest blessings, which can attend their country."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/4/1788,"Besides those inherent rights, which should be established as fundamental principles, independent of the constitution, there are certain other maxims essential to every free government. These should pervade the whole plan. They should be interwoven with its very texture. And, as it is necessary that the first should be preserved sacred and inviolate; so ought the last to be regarded as indispensible. These should be the leading properties, the head—the soul of the system; whilst those exist entire, supreme and uncontrouled. It will not be denied, that all power is originally vested in the people, and that it should be exercised either immediately by themselves, or mediately by their representatives. These are maxims, without the observance of which the liberty of every nation must expire. When the power is exercised by their representatives, it is expedient that the representation be whole and complete. It should be ample, that amongst the members there may be a competent knowledge of the constituents, their sentiments, connections, views and habits; and that amongst the constituents there may generally be a due degree of knowledge respecting the virtues and abilities of the members. In extensive territories, where the people are widely dispersed, and individuals can have very little communication beyond the circle of their own neighbourhood, the representation should also be extensive. In countries thus situated, unless the legislature be numerous, there cannot be expected amongst the members thereof a general knowledge of their constituents: and when the member to be elected bears a very small proportion to the number of electors, it is utterly improbable that the majority should have an adequate knowledge of those, who will be elected. So that a great part of the community must in a manner be obliged to submit their most important concerns into the hands of a few persons unknown to themselves, and of whose wisdom, integrity and patriotism they can form no competent judgment. Again, the representation should be complete, that is, it should be such as to comprehend every species of interest within the society. All orders of men, who have any permanent interest in the government, as far as practicable, ought to be represented. Regarding, then, the great diversity, which pervades most communities, from the highest funded concerns through the various stages of mercantile and mechanic interests, we must discover the necessity of an extensive delegation. When, therefore, the number of representatives in a legislature is very small, this affords objections, not only because they are not [1577]numerous enough to contain a competent knowledge of their constituents: they are inadequate to, and cannot sufficiently respect, all the complicated, variant and opposite interests, which must necessarily subsist in a commonwealth, whose inhabitants are spread over a wide-extended country. The smallness of their number enhances the dignity of their seats; and none can expect to obtain a seat, except men of the most elevated station. Thus in the beginning of a government so constituted there will be laid a foundation for the exercise of undue influence, whereby every branch of supreme power will be in a manner monopolized by one set of men: and thus the delegation will become partial. For, besides the effect of this undue influence in elections, the dispersed situation of the electors, together with that of the candidates, will ever produce much division amongst the suffrages;—and so the select party, who will be distinguished by their superior wealth, being the leading junto in this business, will easily procure a competent number to decide for themselves or their favorites. Thus it will generally happen, that elections will be determined, not by the majority of the people, but perhaps by an inconsiderable part of them; and the persons chosen will be such, whose situation and rank in life had removed them far from a knowledge of the great body of the people. They will consequently be unacquainted with the customs, feelings, opinions and wishes of most of their constituents; and as the constituents will be unacquainted with their representatives,—these will not possess the confidence of those. Doubt and distrust will prevail.—That course of congenial sentiment—that reciprocity of common interest between legislature and bulk of the nation, which should be the soul of republicanism, and are the chief objects of a free, unbiassed and general representation, will not exist in this kind of government. How, then, can it be expected that a strict regard to the good of all will mark the public proceedings? Who can really imagine that a body, thus constituted and thus invested with sovereign authority, will regularly devote their labors to promote the happiness, prosperity and freedom of a community, over whom they bear the rule—when they view themselves advanced to this state of exaltation—when this high degree of dignity will tempt them to look down with indifference, perhaps contempt, on the inhabitants of a spacious territory, as the subjects of their government—and when they contemplate these, as generally unconnected with themselves in all their most important concerns?—The uniform experience of ages operates against the idea. It may be dangerous to indulge in such a scheme of policy—lest its fairest prospects should prove visionary indeed!—lest in its exercise the directly contrary effects should be produced. For the foregoing reasons, the legislative powers proposed to be granted according to the new system appear liable to material objections. For herein the number of representatives being too small to encourage the idea of a full or complete deputation, there is no prospect of securing a due regard to all the different interests necessarily arising amongst the numerous inhabitants of America, spread over a territory so extensive—so vast—so various in climate, products, habits and connections. That part of the legislature, which is particularly denominated the house of representatives, is indeed the only popular branch; and although these officers are to be chosen by the immediate suffrages of the people, yet their dignity, being necessarily great in proportion as their number is small, fair and unbiassed elections are scarcely probable, if not impracticable. In the appointment and constitution of the other branch, the senate, we have but the shade of a deputation from the people. The state-legislatures, it seems, are to elect this body. The objections, which apply to the house of representatives, hold more strongly with regard to this, in as much as longer continuance in office will be productive of more danger; and the mode of appointment, by rendering them more independent of the people, will preclude these from having any decisive influence on their conduct. It is no argument in favor of the manner proposed, that it is the same, by which the members of the present Congress are chosen. The nature and end of the one being totally different from those of the other, if they be duly considered, it may, perhaps, be thought not inexpedient to vary the proceedings respecting them. The Congress under the present confederation are the deputies of sovereign states in the full exercise of independent government. These deputies are appointed by the legislatures thereof, not for the purpose of regulating the internal police of the states, but to superintend their general and foreign affairs so far as all the states are concerned in common. When, therefore, the legislature of any state is actually existing and in the exercise of their office, it seems not improper that such deputies should be appointed by them: for in strictness they appear to be the deputies of the legislature; and are to them immediately amenable. The proposed senate are to exercise a share of legislation in the general government, and to participate in the sovereignty of America. Thus circumstanced, they will know not any authority superior to that, whereof they themselves possess a part. They are intended, as such, to be a branch of the representation of the people. To the people they ought to be amenable: and by the people they ought to be chosen."
Letter,No,George Mason,John Lamb,,,6/9/1788,"I have had the Honor to receive your Letter dated the 18th. of May, in behalf of the federal republican Committee of New York, upon the Subject of the Government proposed by the late Convention to the respective States for their Adoption; and have communicated it to several respectable Gentlemen of the Convention now met in this City, who are opposed to the Adoption without previous Amendments: They receive, with pleasure, the proposition of your Committee for a free Correspondence on the Subject of Amendments, and have requested me to transmit to your committee such as we have agreed on as necessary for previous Adoption. Although there is a general Concurrence in the Convention of this State that Amendments are necessary, yet, the Members are so equally divided with respect to the Time and Manner of obtaining them, that it cannot now be ascertained whether the Majority will be on our Side or not; if it should be so, I have no doubt but that an official Communication will immediately take place between the Conventions of this State and yours. As the Amendments proposed by the Convention of Massachusets are the first which have been offered to the public,18 and contain in them many things that are necessary, it is deemed proper to make them the Basis of such as may finally be agreed on; and it may also be proper to observe, that an executive Council will be necessary; because Power and Responsibility are two things essential to a good Executive; the first of which cannot be safely given, nor the latter insured, where the Legislative Senate form a part of the Executive. The Judiciary, the exclusive Legislative Power over the ten Miles square, and the Militia, are Subjects to which our Attention will next be turned, and we shall communicate the Result of our Deliberations with all possible Dispatch. The Nature of the Opposition here is such that it has not yet taken any particular form, being composed only of Members of the Convention who meet to prepare such Amendments as they deem necessary to be offered to the Convention: If it should hereafter become necessary to assume one, it is hoped that System and Order will every where appear suitable to the Importance and Dignity of the Cause. In the mean Time, it is recommended to us, to communicate with you under cover to Capt. Jacob Reed jr. of Queen-Street, New York,19 in Order to prevent any Interruption that Curiosity might give. We approve of the Precaution; and also advise that Mr. George Fleming [819]Mercht. of this City be made the Instrument of safe Conveyance on your part. [Enclosure]20 Amendments to the New Constitution of Government. That there be a Declaration or Bill of Rights, asserting and securing from Encroachment, the Essential and unalienable Rights of the People, in some such Manner as the following.— 1. That all Freemen have certain essential inherent Rights, of which they cannot by any Compact, deprive or divest their Posterity; among which are the Enjoyment of Life and Liberty, with the means of acquiring, possessing and protecting Property, and pursuing and obtaining Happiness and Safety. 2. That all Power is naturally vested in, and consequently derived from the People; that Magistrates therefore are their Trustees and Agents, and at all Times amenable to them. 3. That Government ought to be instituted for the Common Benefit, Protection and Security of the People; and that whenever any Government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a Majority of the Community hath an indubitable unalienable and indefeasible Right to reform, alter or abolish it, and to establish another, in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public Weal; and that the Doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary Power and Oppression is absurd, slavish and destructive of the good and Happiness of Mankind. 4. That no man or Set of Men are entitled to exclusive or separate public Emoluments or privileges from the Community, but in Consideration of public Services; which not being descendable neither ought the Offices of Magistrate, Legislator or Judge, or any other public Office, to be hereditary. 5. That the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government should be separate and distinct; and that the Members of the Two first may be restrained from Oppression, by feeling and participating [in] the public Burthens, they should, at fixed periods, be reduced to a private Station, return into the Mass of the people, and the Vacancies be supplied by certain and regular Elections, in which all, or any part of the Former Members to be eligible or ineligible, as the Rules of the Constitution of Government and the Laws shall direct. 6. That the Right of the People to participate in the Legislature is the best Security of Liberty, and the Foundation of all Free Governments; for this purpose Elections ought to be free and frequent; and all men having sufficient Evidence of permanent common Interest with, and Attachment to the Community, ought to have the Right of Suffrage:21 [820]And no Aid, Charge, Tax or Fee can be set, rated or levied upon the People without their own Consent, or that of their Representatives so elected; nor can they be bound by any Law to which they have not in like manner assented for the Public Good. 7. That all power of suspending Laws, or the Execution of Laws by any Authority, without Consent of the Representatives of the People in the Legislature, is injurious to their Rights, and ought not to be exercised. 8. That in all Capital or Criminal Prosecutions, a Man hath a Right to demand the Cause & Nature of his Accusation, to be confronted with the Accusers and Witnesses, to call for Evidence and be admitted Counsel in his Favor, and to a fair and speedy Trial by an impartial Jury of his Vicinage, without whose unanimous Consent he cannot be found guilty, (except in the Government of the Land and Naval Forces in Time of actual War, Invasion or Rebellion) nor can he be compelled to give Evidence against himself. 9. That no Freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or desseized of his Freehold, Liberties, Privileges or Franchises, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his Life, Liberty or Property, but by the Law of the Land. 10. That every Freeman restrained of his Liberty is entitled to a Remedy, to enquire into the Lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same if unlawful, and that such Remedy ought not to be denied or delayed. 11. That in Controversies respecting Property, and in Suits between Man and Man, the ancient Trial by Jury of Facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest Securities to the Rights of a Free people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable. 12. That every Freeman ought to find a certain Remedy, by Recourse to the Laws, for all Injuries or Wrongs he may receive in his person, property or Character: He ought to obtain Right and Justice freely, without sale, compleatly and without Denial, promptly and without Delay; and that all Establishments or Regulations contravening these Rights are oppressive and unjust. 13. That excessive Bail ought not to be required, nor excessive Fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted. 14. That every22 Freeman has a Right to be secure from all unreasonable Searches and Seizures of his Person, his papers, and his property; all Warrants therefore to search suspected places, or to seize any Freeman, his Papers or property, without23 Information upon Oath (or Affirmation of a person religiously scrupulous of taking an Oath) of legal and sufficient Cause, are grievous and Oppressive; and all [821]General Warrants to search suspected Places, or to apprehend any suspected Person, without specially naming or describing the Place or Person, are dangerous and ought not to be granted. 15. That the People have a Right peaceably to assembly together to consult for their common Good, or to instruct their Representatives, and24 that every Freeman has a Right to petition or apply to the Legislature for Redress of Greivances. 16. That the People have a Right to Freedom of Speech, and of writing and publishing their Sentiments; that the Freedom of the Press is one of the great Bulwarks of Liberty, and ought not to be violated. 17. That the People have a Right to keep and to bear Arms; that a well regulated Militia, composed of the Body of the People, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe Defence of a free State; that Standing Armies in Time of Peace are dangerous to Liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided as far as the Circumstances and Protection of the Community will admit; and that in all Cases, the Military should be under strict Subordination to, and governed by the Civil Power. 18. That no Soldier in Time of Peace ought to be quartered in any House without the Consent of the Owner; and in Time of War, only by the civil Magistrate in such Manner as the Laws direct. 19. That any Person religiously scrupulous25 of bearing Arms26 ought to be exempted upon payment of an Equivalent to employ another to bear Arms in his stead. 20. That Religion or the Duty which we owe to our Creator, and the Manner of discharging it, can be directed only by Reason and Conviction, not by Force or Violence, and therefore all Men have an equal, natural, and unaleinable Right to the free Exercise of Religion according to the Dictates of Conscience, and that no particular Religious Sect or Society of Christians ought to be favored or established by Law in preference to others. That each State in the Union shall retain its Sovereignty, Freedom and Independence, and every Power, Jurisdiction and Right which is not by this Constitution expressly delegated to the Congress of the United States. That there shall be one Representative for every Thirty Thousand Persons according to the Enumeration or Census mentioned in the Constitution until the whole Number of Representatives amounts to Two Hundred. That Congress shall not exercise the Powers respecting the Regulation of Elections, vested in them by the Fourth Section of the First Article of the Constitution, but in Cases when a State neglects or [822]refuses to make the Regulations therein mentioned, or shall make Regulations subversive of the Rights of the People to a free and equal Representation in Congress agreeably to the Constitution, or shall be prevented from making Elections by Invasion or Rebellion; and in any of these Cases, such Powers shall be exercised by the Congress only until the Cause be removed. That the Congress do not lay direct Taxes, nor Excises upon any Articles of the Growth, or manufactured from the Growth of any of the American States, but when the Monies arising from the Duties on Imports are insufficient for the public Exigencies; nor then until the Congress shall have first made a Requisition upon the States, to assess, levy and pay their respective Proportions of such Requisitions according to the Enumeration or Census fixed in the Constitution, in such Way and Manner as the Legislature of the State shall judge best; and if any State shall neglect or refuse to pay its proportion pursuant to such Requisition, then Congress may assess and levy such States’ proportion, together with Interest thereon, at the Rate of Six per Centum per Annum, from the Time of Payment prescribed in such Requisition. That the Members of the Senate and House of Representatives shall be ineligible to, and incapable of holding any Office under the Authority of the United States, during the Time for which they shall respectively be elected. (a) That there shall be a constitutional responsible Council, to assist in the Administration of Government, with the Power of chusing out of their own Body, a President, who in case of the Death, Resignation or Disability of the President of the United States, shall act, pro tempore, as Vice President instead of a Vice President elected in the Manner prescribed by the Constitution; and that the Power of making Treaties, appointing Ambassadors, other public Ministers or Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Courts, and all other Officers of the United States, whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution, and which shall be established by Law, be vested in the president of the United States with the Assistance of the Council so to be appointed. But all Treaties so made or entered into, shall be subject to the Revision of the Senate and House of Representatives for their Ratification. And no Commercial Treaty shall be ratified without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members present in both Houses; nor shall any Treaty ceding, contracting, restraining or suspending the Territorial Rights or Claims of the United States, or any of them, or their or any of their Rights or Claims to fishing in the American Seas, or navigating the American Rivers be ratified without [823]the Consent of Three-Fourths of the Whole Number of the Members of both Houses. No Navigation Law, or Law for regulating Commerce, shall be passed without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members present in both Houses. No Standing Army or Regular Troops shall be raised or kept up in Time of Peace without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members of both Houses. Neither the president, nor Vice President of the United States, nor any Member of the Council, shall command the Army or Navy of the United States in person, without the Consent of Two-Thirds of the Members of both Houses. No Soldier shall be enlisted for a longer Term than four Years, except in Time of War, and then for no longer Term than the Continuance of the War. No Mutiny Act shall be passed for any longer Term than Two Years. The President of the United States, or any other Officer acting under the Authority of the United States shall, upon Impeachment, be suspended from the Exercise of his Office during his Trial.

(a)This Article not yet finally agreed upon by the Committee appointed to prepare the amendments.—"
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/11/1788,"Although the senate and house of representatives are to be established, and it seems to be the spirit of the proposed plan of government, that they should be considered as the grand deputation of America—the great aggregate body, to whom shall be delegated the important trust of representing the whole nation—the august, puissant assembly, in whom shall reside the full majesty of the people: yet, it seems too, these alone shall not be sufficient to exercise the powers of legislation. It is ordained, as a necessary expedient in the fœderal government, that a president of the United States (who is to hold the supreme executive power) should also concur in passing every law. In monarchy, where the established maxim is, that the king should be respected as a great and transcendent personage, who knows no equal—who in his royal political capacity can commit no wrong—to whom no evil can be ascribed—in whom exists the height of perfection—who is supreme above all, and accountable to no earthly being, it is consistent with such a maxim, that the prince should form a constituent branch of the legislature, and that his power of rejecting whatever has been passed by the other branches should be distinct, and co-extensive with that of either of those branches in rejecting what has been proposed and consented to by the other. It is necessary that the fundamental laws of the realm should ascribe to the king those [1610]high and eminent attributes—that he should possess in himself the sovereignty of the nation; and that the regal dignity should distinguish him, as superior to all his subjects, and in his political character endowed with certain inherent qualities, which cannot be supposed to reside in any other individual within the kingdom: otherwise, that constitutional independence, which the laws meant peculiarly to establish in his person, would not be preserved. To this end the king of England is invested with the sole executive authority, and a branch of legislative jurisdiction so far as to pass his negative on all proceedings of the other two branches, or to confirm them by his assent. This secures to him the intended superiority in the constitution, and gives him the ascendant in government; else his sovereignty would become a shadow—whilst that doctrine, whereby he is declared to be the head, the beginning and end of the great body politic, would prove to be nothing more than mere sound. This two-fold jurisdiction established in the British monarch being founded on maxims extremely different from those, which prevail in the American States, the writer hereof is inclined to hope that he will not be thought singular, if he conceives an impropriety in assimilating the component parts of the American government to those of the British: and as the reasons, which to the founders of the British constitution were motives superior to all others to induce them thus to give the executive a controul over the legislative, are so far from existing in this country, that every principle of that kind is generally, if not universally, exploded; so it should appear that the same public spirit, which pervades the nation, would proclaim the doctrine of prerogative and other peculiar properties of the royal character, as incompatible with the view of these states when they are settling the form of a republican government. Is it not therefore sufficient that every branch in the proposed system be distinct and independent of each other—that no one branch might receive any accession of power (by taking part of another) which would tend to overturn the balance and thereby endanger the very being of the constitution? Whilst the king of England enjoys all the regalia, which are annexed to his crown—whilst he exercises a transcendent dominion over his subjects, the existence whereof is coeval with the first rudiments of their constitution—let the free citizens of America, consulting their true national happiness, wish for no innovation, but what is regulated according to the scale of equal liberty, or which may not destroy that liberty by too great a share of power being lodged in any particular hands;—let this collateral jurisdiction, which constitutes the royal negative, be held by kings alone, since with kings it first originated:—Let [1611]this remain in its native soil, as most congenial to it; there it will cumber less, and be more productive,—here it will be an exotick, and may poison the stock, in which it may be engrafted. It will be said, perhaps, that the power, granted the president, of approving or disapproving the proceedings, which have passed the senate and house of representatives, will not be so decisive in its nature as the king’s negative. True it is, this power of rejecting does not extend so far as primarily to produce an entire overthrow of any law, which has passed those two houses: but it may be expected that in many instances this negative will amount to a final and conclusive rejection. For as a law, which has been once disapproved by the president, cannot be re-passed without the agreement of two-thirds of both houses, there can be no doubt, it will frequently happen that this concurrence of two thirds cannot be obtained. The law must then fall: and thus the president, although he has not the power of resolving originally and enacting any laws, independent of those two houses, hath nevertheless in the legislative scale of government a weight almost equal to that of two thirds of the whole Congress. If the system proposed had been calculated to extend his authority a little farther, he would preponderate against all—he alone would possess the sovereignty of America. For if the whole executive authority and an absolute, entire negative on the legislature should become united in one person, these must, with regard to that person, destroy every idea of a subject. Thus circumstanced he cannot be the object of any laws; he will be above all law: as none can be enacted without his consent—he will be elevated to the height of supremacy.— How near will the president approach to this consummate degree of power! The portion allotted him may, however, be amply sufficient to give him the ascendant in the constitution. He must continually acquire great accessions of weight in every scale of government, as chief magistrate and generalissimo of the United States—at the same time possessing so great a share in the legislature, as a revision of all bills and other proceedings which shall have passed the senate and house of representatives with a discretionary right of rejecting them—united with the senate in making treaties, appointing all public ministers, judges, and a train of other officers, who will be necessary for carrying on the business of government; thus dispensing honor and profit throughout America—whilst copious streams of influence must flow from him, as from a source. Can the different departments be duly balanced when all these high powers concenter in one branch? Is it not rather probable that this branch will destroy the balance, and eventually rise to the fulness of dominion? When the spirit of America becomes such, as to ascribe to their president all those extraordinary qualities, which the subjects of kingly governments ascribe to their princes: then, it is presumed, and not till then, he may consistently be invested with a power similar to theirs. It is remarkable how the president and senate mutually participate in the exercise of a two-fold jurisdiction. How, then, can it be surprising to any one, if some citizens, truly jealous of their liberties, are alarmed with the apprehensions of aristocracy? Those, who seriously reflect on the properties of human nature, and who possess republican principles, will suppose they conceive grounds for such apprehensions: those, who have different sentiments, will not care whether there are grounds for such apprehensions, or not."
Newspaper,No,The Impartial Examiner,,Independent Chronicle (VA),,6/18/1788,"When a change, so momentous in it’s nature, as that of new modelling a plan of government, becomes the object of any people’s meditation, every citizen, whose mind is duly impressed with a regard for the welfare of his country, will consider himself under an indispensible obligation to make some such enquiries, as the following.—Whence flows the necessity of a change?—Does it proceed from certain vicious properties, which reside in the old system and form the essential parts of it?—Or will such a measure become eligible, because evils have arisen from the feeble texture of the plan, or a loose exercise of government, [1646]which could not well be avoided?—What are the evils complained of? and what will be their correspondent remedies?—Are the evils radical, and not to be removed but by a general reform throughout the constitution?—Or do they result from a defect in some particular branch only? and may an adequate remedy be effected by introducing a new regulation merely as to that branch? If investigations like these are seriously and dispassionately pursued, and it should be found that the present confederation of the American states contains vicious properties, which are inherent, fundamental, and tending to produce a general corruption, the necessity of a change must then be manifest. This discovery will lead to another enquiry; and that is—Do such properties pervade the whole system and contaminate all the parts of it? If so—then a thorough change will appear to be expedient, and it may be necessary to new model the system. If, on the other hand, evils are found existing, which proceed, not so much from any internal corrupt qualities, as from the feeble texture of any parts of the system, or a laxity in the exercise of it’s powers, it should seem adviseable to make alterations so far as to add a due degree of strength to the weak parts, and thereby insure efficacy in the government. Should it appear, after a proper enquiry into the nature of the evils, that they are radical, and strike at the vital principles of the constitution—then to apply a correspondent remedy, an institution, which would produce a general reform, might with great propriety be deemed requisite. If the defects are of a trivial nature, and subsist merely in some particular department or branch of the system—then amendments in the defective branch, tending to give energy where it had hitherto been wanting, would be amply sufficient for removing the evils and forming a competent remedy. In order to discover how far the present system is vicious, or inadequate to the purposes of this great confederated society, for which it was established, a retrospect of the original design of the confederacy itself may afford no small degree of assistance.—Let it be recollected, then, that the primary object was to form a perfect union. This is manifested by the very “stile of the confederacy.”—That it was intended to promote justice equally between all the states cannot be doubted; because it is an institution, calculated to unite a number of independent republics under a firm league of amity, and to provide that contributions of every kind, which had been, or might be, necessary towards supporting their general government, should be furnished in due proportions [1647]—whilst it was stipulated that a mutual intercourse and reciprocal privileges and immunities should subsist between the citizens of all the several states. Again, to ensure domestic tranquility must have been another important object with the framers of this confederation: for union, harmony and justice cannot fail to promote tranquility; and whenever a contract is formed for the purpose of procuring the three first, it follows, as a regular consequence, that the other should partake of the intention.—This great association is expressly declared to be entered into between the states “for their common defence, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to, or attacks made upon, them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretence whatever.”2 The objects herein recited do certainly form the chief design of the present confederation; and the same are declared to be the great ends of the proposed plan of government. So far then do they agree. A subject of much contention, however, and with which the minds of different citizens are variously agitated, has arose. It has been said that some of these advantages, and of high import too, cannot be obtained under the present system. It is the opinion of some citizens that the constitution proposed to us will secure all these objects and form a complete remedy for every evil now subsisting; whilst it is asserted by others that amendments might be introduced in the former, which would be competent to every good purpose, and promote some of very great consequence, that might be endangered by an adoption of the latter. Thus it is inferred that this system extends too far—and, like many human institutions, flits by a rapid progress from one extreme to another. Those, who cannot approve of this plan, have very strong objections to it, because they apprehend that no security for their liberties will remain after it’s adoption: and although some of the ends proposed might be obtained thereby; yet they think the sacrifice will be too great for the benefit to be received. To enjoy a competent degree of liberty they consider as the greatest of human blessings—for the loss of which no acquisitions whatsoever can compensate. They esteem this (and deservedly too) as the soul of all political happiness. It seems to be agreed on all sides that in the present system of union the Congress are not invested with sufficient powers for regulating commerce, and procuring the requisite contributions for all expences, that may be incurred for the common defence or general welfare. Hence arise the principal defects;—and it is presumed that the evils resulting from [1648]these weak branches in the federal government might be adequately remedied by making due amendments merely therein. It is thought by some that the powers of making and enforcing the observance of treaties are not ample enough at present. If so—cannot these be enlarged so as to answer every desirable purpose of that branch in the federal institution? Thus, while many citizens cannot think that the confederation is fundamentally vicious, but that all the evils now complained of do rather proceed from a weakness in some of its parts, they apprehend no necessity for an innovation further than strengthening those parts. If such measures were effectually established, they conceive that all the great ends of the general government might be promoted.—No contention, therefore, subsists about supporting a union, but only concerning the mode; and as well those, who disapprove of the proposed plan, as those, who approve of it, consider the existence of a union as essential to their happiness.
