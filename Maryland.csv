Newspaper,No,,,Maryland Journal,,9/28/1787,"The following is the Conclusion of the SPEECH of SAMUEL CHASE, Esq; delivered, this Day, at the Court-House, before a numerous and respectable Body of Citizens. (Published by Request of many Electors of Baltimore-Town.) The Constitution proposed by the late Convention, for the United States, will alter, and, in some Instances, abolish our Bill of Rights and Form of Government. The Legislature of this State have no Right to alter our Form of Government, but in the Mode prescribed by the Constitution.2 The only Question for the General Assembly to determine is this, whether they will recommend to the People to elect Delegates to meet in Convention, to consider and decide on the Plan proposed. I have always maintained the Union, and the Increase of Powers in Congress. I think the Federal Government must be greatly altered. I have not formed my Opinion, whether the Plan proposed ought to be accepted, as it stands, without any Amendment or Alteration.—The Subject is very momentous, and involves the greatest Consequences. If elected, I will vote for, and use my Endeavours to procure a Recommendation by the Legislature, to call a Convention, as soon as it can conveniently be done, unless otherways directed by this Town. September 26, 1787. Having been informed, that my Engagement, of Yesterday, to the Meeting, at the Court House, “to vote for, and use my Endeavours to procure a Recommendation, by the Legislature, to call a Convention, as soon as it can conveniently be done,” is not understood; from a Desire, if possible, to remove all Misunderstanding, I take the Liberty to declare, that by the above Promise I meant to engage, and therefore do promise, if elected, that I will use my Endeavours to procure, at the next Session of Assembly, and as soon in the Session as the necessary Business of the State will permit, a Recommendation by the General [11]Assembly to call a Convention, to consider and decide on the Constitution proposed by the late Convention for the United States, and to appoint the Election of Delegates to the Convention as soon as the Convenience of the People will permit. I further beg Leave to add, as my Opinion, that the Election of Delegates to the Convention ought to be as early in the Spring as may be. SAMUEL CHASE. Baltimore, September 27, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Caution,,Maryland Journal,,8/12/1787,"To the INHABITANTS of BALTIMORE TOWN. An attempt to surprise you into any public measure, ought to meet your indignation and contempt. When violence or cunning is substituted for argument and reason, suspicion should take the alarm, and prudence should dictate the propriety of deliberation. Questions of consequence in private life, ought not to be hastily decided, and with greater reason, determinations, that involve the future felicity of a whole people, ought not to be taken before the most mature and deliberate consideration, and a free and full examination of the subject, and all its consequences.—These reflections occurred on being informed that some gentlemen of this Town, employ themselves in carrying about and soliciting subscribers to a petition, addressed to the General Assembly, requesting them to call a Convention to ratify the new system of government, proposed for the United States, by the late Convention at Philadelphia.2 If this petition contained no more, it would not have been worthy of notice; but it publishes to the world your entire approbation of the New Federal Government, and your desire that it should be adopted and confirmed by this State, as it stands, without any amendment or alteration. The ostensible cause for offering you the petition to sign is, that you may express your sentiments to the legislature, that [15]they ought to call a Convention to ratify the new form of government for the United States; but the real design of the promoters of the petition is to draw you into a declaration in favour of the whole system, and to bind you hereafter to support it, which you must do, or allege deception and surprise, if, on further reflection, you should discover that you rashly gave an opinion against your real interests. If the real intention of the promoters and carriers of this petition was only to obtain your opinion in favour of calling a Convention, it might have been expressed in a few lines; and no one would oppose such a petition, although improper and unnecessary, because your Delegates will certainly move for, and exert themselves to procure, the calling a Convention; and no member of the General Assembly will deny that, in so doing, your Delegates speak your sentiments. In my opinion, it is not necessary or proper for you, at this time, to express your approbation, or disapprobation, of the new constitution for the United States, for the following reasons: First—because the decision for or against the plan, is of the greatest consequence, as it involves no less than the happiness or misery of you and all your posterity forever; and therefore, I think, requires your dispassionate and most deliberate consideration.—Secondly—because you want information, and have not had time yourselves to examine the proposed system, and to consider the consequences that may flow from rejecting or adopting it.—Thirdly—because time is not given for your countrymen in this, and the other States, to consider the subject, and to lay their sentiments and reasons for or against the measure before you.—Fourthly—because you ought to hear both sides, as the man who determines on hearing one party only, will almost always be mistaken in his judgment: He may be in the right, but it will be by chance, and not by reason.—Fifthly—because you are not pressed in point of time to determine on the subject; you have at least three months for deliberation; to decide, therefore, in a few days, will be rashness and folly.—Sixthly—when men urge you to determine in haste, on so momentous a subject, it is not unreasonable to inquire their motives; and it is not uncharitable to suspect that they are improper; and no possible mischief or inconvenience can happen from delay.

Newspaper,No,,,Freeman's Journal,,11/27/1787,"Extract of a letter from Queen Anne’s county, (Maryland) November 12. “You tell me of the beauties of the new constitution, and that great part of your state are for adopting it,—but this is quite different with our people; nobody now supposes that it will go down in this state, without a bill of rights, and very material alterations. You say, that General Washington’s name will force it down in all the states—but you are as much mistaken in that, as I was: I find that our southern states are clearer on this head than any other, that the greatest names ought not to prejudice any man in such an important business; but you will say to this, that the greatest prophet has no honor in his own country.2 I am often told, when I am arguing with them, that the general would not wish people to adopt it because his name is prefixed to it, and some have told me that the General, Mr. Franklin, and some others, did only sign as witnesses, and that they had no hand in forming it; I have shewn these people Mr. Wilson’s speech3 which you sent me, but I find it does not answer here—pray send me some good, sound, plain, argumentative pieces, for I am looked very slyly at frequently, and I am afraid that there must be some cause for it. Please inform me how I shall get over this sweeping clause, as they call it, viz.—‘That the constitution and laws of Congress are to have the power of regulating every thing in the state, and to be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the constitutions or laws of any of the states to the contrary notwithstanding;’4 for in their arguing for a bill of rights they always throw up this in the way, among other objections. Every body I see from Virginia, informs me, that all is going against us all over that state, and they tell me, that there has been a trial of the proposed plan in a court-house there; when the business of the court was over, the lawyers divided [62]themselves for and against, judges and jury were appointed, when, after several hours debating on both sides, before hundreds of people, the jury, without going out of court, gave their verdict against it unanimously.”"
Letter,Yes,Uriah Forrest,Thomas Jefferson,,,12/11/1787,"I am afraid the proposed constitution will serve to increase the disorders that it’s framers wished to extinguish. It contains many good articles, but I am free to own there appears to me some so very bad, as to throw the weight in that scale. I cannot reconcile myself to the Idea of a chief magistrate being eligible a second time, much less continuable for Life. Were not the members too strongly impressed with the late commotion in Massachusetts?2 We surely have suffer’d the people of this Country and those who are disaffected in our own, to influence our opinion respecting the true state & situation of our people [112]& Government—the most trifling events have been magnified into monstrous outrages.—Will the next generation credit us that, in the first twelve Years of the Independence of thirteen free powerful & seperate States, only one Rebellion happen’d, and that that one terminated so speedily and honourably towards Govt.? The peoples judgments were no sooner inform’d than they return’d to allegiance, and were convinced that their grievences were immaginary, and that they were not oppressed in the manner a few desperate Characters had attempted to teach them.— I am obliged to own myself one of those, who do not wish to see the people more obedient to their rulers in the next twelve, or any other twelve years, than they have been in the last.—a proper spirit of resistance is the best security for their liberties, and they shou’d now & then warn their rulers of it. As I am in the legislature and shall be in the convention for the consideration of this proposed Constitution,3 and it is surely a question of the utmost consequence, I wish to acquire every possible information—. If your Excellency will indulge me with such observations on it as hath occur’d to you, it will indeed oblige me—rest assured that no other use shall be made of them, than the correcting of my judgment and opinion on the subject.4"

Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,12/28/1787,"Mr. Hayes, It was the wish of many respectable characters both in the House of Assembly, and others, that the information received from the Delegates to the late Convention, should be made public.2—I have taken some pains, to collect together, the substance of the information, which was given on that occasion to the House of Delegates by Mr. Martin; by your inserting it in your paper, you will oblige a customer. Mr. MARTIN, when called upon, addressed the House nearly as follows: Mr. Speaker, Since I was notified of the resolve of this Honourable House, that we should attend this day, to give information with regard to the proceedings of the late convention, my time has necessarily been taken up with business, and I have also been obliged to make a journey to the Eastern-Shore: These circumstances have prevented me from being as well prepared as I could wish, to give the information required—However, the few leisure moments I could spare, I have devoted to refreshing my memory, by looking over the papers and notes in my possession; and shall with pleasure, to the best of my abilities, render an account of my conduct. It was not in my power to attend the convention immediately on my appointment—I took my seat, I believe, about the eighth or ninth of June. I found that Governor Randolph, of Virginia, had laid before the convention certain propositions for their consideration, which have been read to this House by my Honourable colleague, and I believe, he has very faithfully detailed the substance of the speech with which the business of the convention was opened, for though I was not there at the time, I saw notes which had been taken of it.3—The members of the convention from the States, came there under different powers. The greatest number, I believe under powers, nearly the same as those of the delegates of this State4—Some came to the convention under the former appointment, authorising the meeting of delegates merely to regulate trade.—Those of Delaware were expressly instructed to agree to no system which should take away from the States, that equality of suffrage secured by the original articles of confederation. Before I arrived, a number of rules had been adopted to regulate the proceedings of the convention, by one of which, seven States might proceed to business, [129]and consequently four States, the majority of that number, might eventually have agreed upon a system which was to effect the whole Union. By another, the doors were to be shut, and the whole proceedings were to be kept secret; and so far did this rule extend, that we were thereby prevented from corresponding with gentlemen in the different States upon the subjects under our discussion—a circumstance, Sir, which I confess, I greatly regretted—I had no idea that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of this State, or of the others, were centered in the convention—I wished to have corresponded freely, and confidentially, with eminent political characters in my own, and other States, not implicitly to be dictated to by them, but to give their sentiments due weight and consideration. So extremely solicitous were they, that their proceedings should not transpire, that the members were prohibited even from taking copies of resolutions, on which the convention were deliberating, or extracts of any kind from the journals without formally moving for, and obtaining permission, by a vote of the convention for that purpose. You have heard, Sir, the resolutions which were brought forward by the honourable member from Virginia—let me call the attention of this House, to the conduct of Virginia, when our confederation was entered into—That State then proposed, and obstinately contended, contrary to the sense of, and unsupported by the other States, for an inequality of suffrage founded on numbers, or some such scale, which should give her, and certain other States, influence in the Union over the rest—pursuant to that spirit which then characterized her, and uniform in her conduct, the very second resolve, is calculated expressly for that purpose to give her a representation proportioned to her numbers, as if the want of that was the principle defect in our original system, and this alteration the great means of remedying the evils we had experienced under our present government. The object of Virginia and other large States, to increase their power and influence over the others, did not escape observation—The subject, however, was discussed with great coolness in the committee of the whole House (for the convention had resolved itself into a committee of the whole to deliberate upon the propositions delivered in by the honourable member from Virginia). Hopes were formed, that the farther we proceeded in the examination of the resolutions, the better the House might be satisfied of the impropriety of adopting them, and that they would finally be rejected by a majority of the committee—If on the contrary, a majority should report in their favour, it was considered that it would not preclude the members from bringing forward and submitting any other system to the consideration of the convention; and accordingly, while those resolves were the subject of discussion in the [130]committee of the whole House, a number of the members who disapproved them, were preparing another system, such as they thought more conducive to the happiness and welfare of the States—The propositions originally submitted to the convention having been debated, and undergone a variety of alterations in the course of our proceedings, the committee of the whole House by a small majority agreed to a report, which I am happy, Sir, to have in my power to lay before you5—It was as follow: 1. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee, that a national government ought to be established, consisting of a supreme, legislative, judiciary and executive. 2. That the legislative ought to consist of two branches. 3. That the members of the first branch of the national legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several States, for the term of three years, to receive fixed stipends, by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the national treasury, to be ineligible to any office established by a particular State, or under the authority of the United States, except those particularly belonging to the functions of the first branch, during the term of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 4. That the members of the second branch of the legislature ought to be chosen by the individual legislatures, to be of the age of thirty years at least, to hold their offices for a term sufficient to ensure their independency, namely, seven years, one third to go out biennially, to receive fixed stipends, by which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to public service, to be paid out of the national treasury, to be ineligible to any office by a particular State, or under the authority of the United States, except those peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch, during the term of service, and under the national government, for the space of one year after its expiration. 5. That each branch ought to possess the right of originating acts. 6. That the national legislature ought to be empowered to enjoy the legislative rights vested in Congress by the confederation, and moreover, to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted, by the exercise of individual legislation; to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening, in the opinion of the legislature of the United States, the articles of union, or any treaties subsisting under the authority of the Union. 7. That the right of suffrage in the first branch of the national legislature, ought not to be according to the rule established in the articles of confederation, but according to some equitable rate of representation, namely, [131]in proportion to the whole number of white, and other free citizens and inhabitants of every age, sex and condition, including those bound to servitude for a term of years, and three fifths of all other persons, not comprehended in the foregoing description, except Indians not paying taxes in each State. 8. That the right of suffrage in the second branch of the national legislature, ought to be according to the rule established in the first. 9. That a national executive be instituted to consist of a single person, to be chosen by the national legislature for the term of seven years, with power to carry into execution the national laws, to appoint to offices in cases not otherwise provided for, to be ineligible a second time, and to be removable on impeachment and conviction of malpractice or neglect of duty, to receive a fixed stipend, by which he may be compensated for the devotion of his time to public service—to be paid out of the national treasury. 10. That the national executive shall have a right to negative any legislative act which shall not afterwards be passed, unless by two third parts of each branch of the national legislature. 11. That a national judiciary be established, to consist of one supreme tribunal, the judges of which, to be appointed by the second branch of the national legislature, to hold their offices during good behaviour, and to receive punctually, at stated times, a fixed compensation for their services, in which no increase or diminution shall be made, so as to affect the persons actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution. 12. That the national legislature be empowered to appoint inferior tribunals. 13. That the jurisdiction of the national judiciary shall extend to cases which respect the collection of the national revenue; cases arising under the laws of the United States—impeachments of any national officer, and questions which involve the national peace and harmony. 14. Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the admission of States lawfully arising within the limits of the United States whether from a voluntary junction of government, territory, or otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the national legislature less than the whole. 15. Resolved, That provision ought to be made for the continuance of Congress, and their authority and privileges, until a given day after the reform of the articles of union shall be adopted, and for the completion of all their engagements. 16. That a republican constitution and its existing laws ought to be guarranteed to each State by the United States. 17. That provision ought to be made for the amendment of the articles of union, whensoever it shall seem necessary. 18. That the legislative, executive and judiciary powers, within the several States, ought to be bound by oath to support the articles of the union. 19. That the amendments which shall be offered to the confederation by this convention, ought, at a proper time or times, after the approbation of Congress, to be submitted to an assembly or assemblies, recommended by the legislatures, to be expressly chosen by the people to consider and decide thereon. These propositions, Sir, were acceeded to by a majority of the members of the committee—a system by which the large States were to have not only an inequality of suffrage in the first branch, but also the same inequality in the second branch, or senate; however, it was not designed the second branch should consist of the same number as the first. It was proposed that the senate should consist of twenty-eight members, formed on the following scale—Virginia to send five, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts each four, South-Carolina, North-Carolina, Maryland, New-York, and Connecticut two each, and the States of New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Jersey, Delaware, and Georgia each of them one;6 upon this plan, the three large States, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, would have thirteen senators out of twenty-eight, almost one half of the whole number—Fifteen senators were to be a quorum to proceed to business; those three States would, therefore, have thirteen out of that quorum. Having this inequality in each branch of the legislature, it must be evident, Sir, that they would make what laws they pleased, however disagreeable or injurious to the other States, and that they would always prevent the other States from making any laws, however necessary and proper, if not agreeable to the views of those three States—They were not only, Sir, by this system, to have such an undue superiority in making laws and regulations for the Union, but to have the same superiority in the appointment of the president, the judges, and all other officers of government. Hence, those three States would in reality have the appointment of the president, judges, and all the other officers. This president, and these judges, so appointed, we may be morally certain would be citizens of one of those three States; and the president, as appointed by them, and a citizen of one of them, would espouse their interests and their views, when they came in competition with the views and interests of the other States. This president, so appointed by the three large States, and so unduly under their influence, was to have a negative upon every law that should be passed, which, if negatived by him, was not to take effect, unless assented to by two thirds of each branch of the legislatures, a provision which deprived ten States of even the faintest shadow of liberty; for if they, by a miraculous unanimity, having all their members present, should outvote the [133]other three, and pass a law contrary to their wishes, those three large States need only procure the president to negative it, and thereby prevent a possibility of its ever taking effect, because the representatives of those three States would amount to much more than one third (almost one half) of the representatives in each branch. And, Sir, this government, so organized with all this undue superiority in those three large States, was as you see to have a power of negativing the laws passed by every State legislature in the Union. Whether, therefore, laws passed by the legislature of Maryland, New-York, Connecticut, Georgia, or of any other of the ten States, for the regulation of their internal police, should take effect, and be carried into execution, was to depend on the good pleasure of the representatives of Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. This system of slavery, which bound hand and foot ten States in the Union, and placed them at the mercy of the other three, and under the most abject and servile subjection to them, was approved by a majority of the members of the convention, and reported by the committee. On this occasion, the House will recollect, that the convention was resolved into a committee of the whole—of this committee Mr. Gorham was chairman—The honorable Mr. Washington was then on the floor, in the same situation with any other member of the convention at large, to oppose any system he thought injurious, or to propose any alterations or amendments he thought beneficial, to these propositions so reported by the committee, no opposition was given by that illustrious personage, or by the president of the State of Pennsylvania.7 They both appeared cordially to approve them, and to give them their hearty concurrence; yet this system, I am confident, Mr. Speaker, there is not a member in this house would advocate, or who would hesitate one moment in saying it ought to be rejected. I mention this circumstance in compliance with the duty I owe this honorable body, not with a view to lessen those exalted characters, but to shew how far the greatest and best of men may be led to adopt very improper measures, through error in judgment, State influence, or by other causes, and to shew that it is our duty not to suffer our eyes to be so far dazzled by the splendor of names, as to run blindfolded into what may be our destruction. Mr. Speaker, I revere those illustrious personages as much as any man here. No man has a higher sense of the important services they have rendered this country. No member of the convention went there more disposed to pay a deference to their opinions; but I should little have deserved the trust this State reposed in me, if I could have sacrificed its dearest interests to my complaisance for their sentiments. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/1/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. When contrary to our hopes it was found, that a majority of the members of the convention had in the committee agreed to the system, I have laid before you, we then thought it necessary to bring forward the propositions, which such of us who disapproved the plan before had prepared—The members who had prepared these resolutions were principally of the Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland delegations.—The honorable Mr. Patterson, of the Jerseys, laid them before the convention—of these propositions(a) I am in possession of a copy, which I shall beg leave to read to you.2 These propositions were referred to a committee of the whole house.—Unfortunately the New-Hampshire delegation had not yet arrived, and the sickness of a relation of the honorable Mr. McHenry, obliged him still to be absent, a circumstance, Sir, which I considered much to be regretted, as Maryland thereby was represented by only two delegates, and they unhappily differed very widely in their sentiments.3 The result of the referrence of these last propositions to a committee, was a speedy and hasty determination to reject them4—I doubt not, Sir, to those who consider them with attention, so sudden a rejection will appear surprising; but it may be proper to inform you, that on our meeting in convention, it was soon found there were among us three parties of very different sentiments and views. One party, whose object and wish it was to abolish and annihilate all State governments, and to bring forward one general government over [136]this extensive continent of a monarchical nature, under certain restrictions and limitations:—Those who openly avowed this sentiment were, it is true, but few, yet it is equally true, Sir, that there was a considerable number who did not openly avow it, who were by myself, and many others of the convention, considered as being in reality favourers of that sentiment, and acting upon those principles, covertly endeavouring to carry into effect what they well knew openly and avowedly could not be accomplished.5 The second party was not for the abolition of the State governments, nor for the introduction of a monarchical government under any form; but they wished to establish such a system as would give their own States undue power and influence in the government over the other States.—A third party was what I considered truly federal and republican—This party was nearly equal in number with the other two, and were composed of the delegations from Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Delaware, and in part from Maryland; also of some individuals from other representations.—This party, Sir, were for proceeding upon terms of federal equality; they were for taking our present federal system as the basis of their proceedings, and as far as experience had shewn us that there were defects, to remedy those defects, as far as experience had shewn that other powers were necessary to the federal government, to give those powers—They considered this, the object for which they were sent by their State, and what their States expected from them—They urged, that if after doing this, experience should shew that there still were defects in the system (as no doubt there would be) the same good sense that induced this convention to be called, would cause the States when they found it necessary to call another; and if that convention should act with the same moderation, the members of it would proceed to correct such errors and defects as experience should have brought to light—That by proceeding in this train, we should have a prospect at length of obtaining as perfect a system of federal government, as the nature of things would admit. On the other hand, if we, contrary to the purpose for which we were intrusted, considering ourselves as master-builders, too proud to amend our original government, should demolish it entirely, and erect a new system of our own, a short time might shew the new system as defective as the old, perhaps more so—Should a convention be found necessary again, if the members thereof acting upon the same principles, instead of amending and correcting its defects, should demolish that entirely, and bring forward a third system, that also might soon be found no better than either of the former, and thus we might always remain young in government, and always suffering the inconveniences of an incorrect, imperfect system. But, Sir, the favourers of monarchy, and those who wished the total abolition of State governments, well knowing that a government founded on truly federal principles, the basis of which were the Thirteen State governments, preserved in full force and energy, would be destructive of their views; and knowing they were too weak in numbers, openly to bring forward their system, conscious also that the people of America would reject it if proposed to them, joined their interest with that party, who wished a system, giving particular States the power and influence over the others, procuring in return mutual sacrifices from them, in giving the government great and undefined powers as to its legislative and executive, well knowing that by departing from a federal system, they paved the way for their favourite object, the destruction of the State governments, and the introduction of monarchy—And hence, Mr. Speaker, I apprehend, in a great measure, arose the objections of those honorable members Mr. Mason and Mr. Gerry.6 In every thing that tended to give the large States power over the smaller, the first of those gentlemen could not forget he belonged to the ancient dominion, nor could the latter forget that he represented Old Massachusetts; that part of the system which tended to give those States power over the others, met with their perfect approbation; but when they viewed it charged with such powers as would destroy all State governments, their own as well as the rest—when they saw a president so constituted as to differ from a monarch, scarcely but in name, and having it in his power to become such in reality when he pleased; they being republicans and federalists as far as an attachment to their own States would permit them, they warmly and zealously opposed those parts of the system. From these different sentiments, and from this combination of interest, I apprehend, Sir, proceeded the fate of what was called the Jersey resolutions, and the report made by the committee of the whole house. The Jersey propositions being thus rejected, the convention took up those reported by the committee, and proceeded to debate them by paragraphs7—It was now that they who disapproved the report found it necessary to make a warm and decided opposition, which took place upon the discussion of the seventh resolution, which related to the inequality of representation in the first branch.—Those who advocated this inequality, urged, that when the articles of confederation were formed, it was only from necessity and expediency that the States were admitted each to have an equal vote; but that our situation was now altered, and therefore those States who considered it contrary to their interest, would no longer abide by it. They said no State ought to wish to have influence in government, except in proportion to what it contributes to it; that if it contributes but little, it ought to have but a small vote; that taxation and representation ought always to go together; that if [138]one State had sixteen times as many inhabitants as another, or was sixteen times as wealthy, it ought to have sixteen times as many votes; that an inhabitant of Pennsylvania ought to have as much weight and consequence as an inhabitant of Jersey or Delaware; that it was contrary to the feelings of the human mind—what the large States would never submit to; that the large States would have great objects in view, in which they would never permit the smaller States to thwart them; that equality of suffrage was the rotten part of the constitution, and that this was a happy time to get clear of it. In fine, that it was the poison which contaminated our whole system, and the source of all the evils we experienced.8 This, Sir, is the substance of the arguments, if arguments they can be called, which were used in favour of inequality of suffrage.—Those, who advocated the equality of suffrage, took the matter up on the original principles of government—They urged that all men considered in a state of nature, before any government formed, are equally free and independent, no one having any right or authority to exercise power over another, and this without any regard to difference in personal strength, understanding, or wealth—That when such individuals enter into government, they have each a right to an equal voice in its first formation, and afterwards have each a right to an equal vote in every matter which relates to their government—That if it could be done conveniently, they have a right to exercise it in person—Where it cannot be done in person but for convenience, representatives are appointed to act for them, every person has a right to an equal vote in choosing that representative who is entrusted to do for the whole, that which the whole, if they could assemble, might do in person, and in the transacting of which each would have an equal voice—That if we were to admit, because a man was more wise, more strong, or more wealthy, he should be entitled to more votes than another, it would be inconsistent with the freedom and liberty of that other, and would reduce him to slavery—Suppose, for instance, ten individuals in a state of nature, about to enter into government, nine of whom are equally wise, equally strong, and equally wealthy, the tenth is ten times as wise, ten times as strong or ten times as rich; if for this reason he is to have ten votes for each vote of either of the others, the nine might as well have no vote at all, since though the whole nine might assent to a measure, yet the vote of the tenth would countervail, and set aside all their votes—If this tenth approved of what they wished to adopt, it would be well, but if he disapproved, he could prevent it, and in the same manner he could carry into execution any measure he wished contrary to the opinion of all the others, he having ten votes, and the other all together but nine—It is evident, that on these principles, the nine would have no will nor discretion of their own, but must be totally dependent on the will [139]and discretion of the tenth, to him they would be as absolutely slaves as any negro is to his master.—If he did not attempt to carry into execution any measures injurious to the other nine, it could only be said that they had a good master, they would not be the less slaves, because they would be totally dependent on the will of another, and not on their own will—They might not feel their chains, but they would notwithstanding wear them, and whenever their master pleased he might draw them so tight as to gall them to the bone. Hence it was urged the inequality of representation, or giving to one man more votes than another on account of his wealth, &c. was altogether inconsistent with the principles of liberty, and in the same proportion as it should be adopted, in favour of one or more, in that proportion are the others inslaved—It was urged that though every individual should have an equal voice in the government, yet, even then superiour wealth, strength or understanding, would give great and undue advantages to those who possessed them. That wealth attracts respect and attention; superior strength would cause the weaker and more feeble to be cautious how they offended, and to put up with small injuries rather than to engage in an unequal contest—In like manner superior understanding would give its possessor many opportunities of profiting at the expence of the more ignorant.—Having thus established these principles with respect to the rights of individuals in a state of nature, and what is due to each on entering into government, principles established by every writer on liberty, they proceeded to shew that States, when once formed, are considered with respect to each other as individuals in a state of nature—That, like individuals, each State is considered equally free and equally independent, the one having no right to exercise authority over the other, though more strong, more wealthy, or abounding with more inhabitants—That when a number of States unite themselves under a federal government, the same principles apply to them as when a number of individual men unite themselves under a State government—That every argument which shews one man ought not to have more votes than another, because he is wiser, stronger or wealthier, proves that one State ought not to have more votes than another, because it is stronger, richer, or more populous—And that by giving one State, or one or two States more votes than the others, the others thereby are enslaved to such State or States, having the greater number of votes, in the same manner as in the case before put of individuals where one has more votes than the others—That the reason why each individual man in forming a State government should have an equal vote is, because each individual before he enters into government is equally free and independent—So each State, when States enter into a federal government, are entitled to an equal vote, because before they entered into such federal government, each State was equally free and [140]equally independent—That adequate representation of men formed into a State government, consists in each man having an equal voice either personally, or if by representatives, that he should have an equal voice in choosing the representative—So adequate representation of States in a federal government, consists in each State having an equal voice either in person or by its representative in every thing which relates to the federal government—That this adequacy of representation is more important in a federal, than in a State government, because the members of a State government, the district of which is not very large, have generally such a common interest, that laws can scarcely be made by one part oppressive to the others, without their suffering in common; but the different States composing an extensive federal empire, widely distant, one from the other, may have interests so totally distinct, that the one part might be greatly benefited by what would be destructive to the other. They were not satisfied by resting it on principles; they also appealed to history—They shewed that in the amphyctionic confederation of the Grecian cities, each city however different in wealth, strength, and other circumstances, sent the same number of deputies, and had each an equal voice in every thing that related to the common concerns of Greece. It was shewn that in the seven provinces of the United Netherlands, and the confederated Cantons of Switzerland, each Canton and each province have an equal vote, although there are as great distinctions of wealth, strength, population, and extent of territory among those provinces and those Cantons, as among these States. It was said, that the maxim that taxation and representation ought to go together, was true so far, that no person ought to be taxed who is not represented, but not in the extent insisted upon, to wit, that the quantum of taxation and representation ought to be the same; on the contrary, ⟨the quantum of representation depends upon the quantum of freedom, and therefore all, whether individual States, or individual men, who are equally free, have a right to equal representation⟩9—That to those who insist that he who pays the greatest share of taxes, ought to have the greatest number of votes; it is a sufficient answer to say, that this rule would be destructive of the liberty of the others, and would render them slaves to the more rich and wealthy—That if one man pays more taxes than another, it is because he has more wealth to be protected by government, and he receives greater benefits from the government—So if one State pays more to the federal government, it is because as a State, she enjoys greater blessings from it; she has more wealth protected by it, or a greater number of inhabitants, whose rights are secured, and who share its advantages.

Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/4/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It was urged, that upon this system, the Pennsylvanian or inhabitant of a large State, was of as much consequence as the inhabitant of Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, or any other State—That his consequence was to be decided by his situation in his own State; that if he was there as free, if he had as great share in the forming of his own government, and in the making and executing its laws, as the inhabitants of those other States, then was he equally important and of equal consequence—Suppose a confederation of States had never been adopted, but every State had remained absolutely in its independent situation, no person could, with propriety, say that the citizen of the large State was not as important as the citizen of the smaller, the confederation of the States cannot alter the case. It was said that in all transactions between State and State, the freedom, independence, importance and consequence, even the individuality of each citizen of the different States, might with propriety be said to be swallowed up, or concentrated in the independence, the freedom and the individuality of the State of which they are citizens—That the Thirteen States are thirteen distinct political individual existences as to each other; that the federal government is or ought to be a government over these thirteen political individual existences, which form the members of that government—and that as the largest State is only a single individual of this government, it ought to have only one vote—the smallest State also being one individual member of this government, ought also to have one vote—To those who urged that the States having equal suffrage, was contrary to the feelings of the human heart, it was answered, that it was admitted to be contrary to the feelings of pride and ambition; but those were feelings which ought not to be gratified at the expence of freedom. It was urged, that the position that great States would have great objects in view, in which they would not suffer the less States to thwart them, was one of the strongest reasons why inequality of representation ought not to be admitted—If those great objects were not inconsistent with the interest of the less States, they would readily concur in them, but if they were inconsistent with the interest of a majority of the States composing the government, in that case two or three States ought not to have it in their power to aggrandize themselves at the expence of all the [145]rest—To those who alledged that equality of suffrage in our federal government, was the poisonous source from which all our misfortunes flowed, it was answered, that the allegation was not founded in fact—That equality of suffrage had never been complained of by the States as a defect in our federal system—That among the eminent writers, foreigners and others, who had treated of the defects of our confederation, and proposed alterations, none had proposed an alteration in this part of the system: And members of the convention both in and out of Congress, who advocated the equality of suffrage, called upon their opponents both in and out of Congress, and challenged them to produce one single instance where a bad measure had been adopted, or a good measure had failed of adoption in consequence of the States having an equal vote; on the contrary, they urged, that all our evils flowed from the want of power in the federal head, and that let the right of suffrage in the States be altered in any manner whatever, if no greater powers were given to the government, the same inconveniences would continue. It was denied that the equality of suffrage was originally agreed to on principles of necessity or expediency, on the contrary, that it was adopted on the principles of the rights of men and the rights of States which were then well known, and which then influenced our conduct although now they seem to be forgotten—For this the journals of Congress were appealed to; it was from them shewn, that when the committee of Congress reported to that body the articles of confederation, the very first article which became the subject of discussion, was that respecting the equality of suffrage—That Virginia proposed divers modes of suffrage, all on the principle of inequality, which were almost unanimously rejected2—That on the question for adopting the article, it passed, Virginia being the only State which voted in the negative—That after the articles of confederation were submitted to the States by them to be ratified, almost every State proposed certain amendments, which they instructed their delegates to endeavour to obtain before ratification,3 and that among all the amendments proposed, not one State, not even Virginia, proposed an amendment of that article, securing the equality of suffrage—the most convincing proof it was agreed to and adopted, not from necessity, but upon a full conviction, that according to the principles of free governments, the States had a right to that equality of suffrage. But, Sir, it was to no purpose that the futility of their objections were shewn—when driven from the pretence that the equality of suffrage had been originally agreed to on principles of expediency and necessity, the representatives of the large States persisted in a declaration, that they would never agree to admit the smaller States to an equality of suffrage—In answer to this, they were informed, and informed in terms the most [146]strong and energetic that could possibly be used, that we never would agree to a system giving them the undue influence and superiority they proposed—That we would risque every possible consequence—That from anarchy and confusion order might arise—That slavery was the worst that could ensue, and we considered the system proposed to be the most complete, most abject system of slavery that the wit of man ever devised, under the pretence of forming a government for free States—That we never would submit tamely and servilely to a present certain evil in dread of a future, which might be imaginary—That we were sensible the eyes of our country and of the world were upon us—That we would not labour under the imputation of being unwilling to form a strong and energetic federal government; but we would publish the system which we approved, and also that which we opposed, and leave it to our country and the world at large to judge between us, who best understood the rights of free men and free States, and who best advocated them—and to the same tribunal we would submit who ought to be answerable for all the consequences which might arise to the union from the convention breaking up without proposing any system to their constituents.—During this debate we were threatened, that if we did not agree to the system proposed, we never should have an opportunity of meeting in convention to deliberate on another, and this was frequently urged—In answer, we called upon them to shew what was to prevent it, and from what quarter was our danger to proceed—was it from a foreign enemy? Our distance from Europe, and the political situation of that country, left us but little to fear—Was there any ambitious State or States, who in violation of every sacred obligation was preparing to inslave the other States, and raise itself to consequence on the ruin of the others? Or was there any such ambitious individual? We did not apprehend it to be the case—But suppose it to be true, it rendered it the more necessary that we should sacredly guard against a system which might enable all those ambitious views to be carried into effect, even under the sanction of the constitution and government—in fine, Sir, all these threats were treated with contempt, and they were told that we apprehended but one reason to prevent the States meeting again in convention—that when they discovered the part this convention had acted, and how much its members were abusing the trust reposed in them, the States would never trust another convention.—At length, Sir, after every argument had been exhausted by the advocates of equality of representation, the question was called, when a majority decided in favour of the inequality—Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia voting for it—Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware against it—Maryland divided.4—It may be thought surprising, Sir, that Georgia, a State now small and comparatively trifling in [147]the union, should advocate this system of unequal representation, giving up her present equality in the federal government, and sinking herself almost to total insignificance in the scale; but, Sir, it must be considered that Georgia has the most extensive territory in the union, being larger than the whole island of Great-Britain, and thirty times as large as Connecticut. This system being designed to preserve to the States their whole territory unbroken, and to prevent the erection of new States within the territory of any of them—Georgia looked forward when her population, being increased in some measure proportioned to her territory, she should rise in the scale and give law to the other States, and hence we found the delegation of Georgia warmly advocating the proposition of giving the States unequal representation. Next day the question came on with respect to the inequality of representation in the second branch, but little debate took place; the subject had been exhausted on the former question. On the votes being taken, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina and South-Carolina voted for the inequality. Connecticut, New-York, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland(a) were in the negative. Georgia had only two representatives on the floor, one of whom (not I believe because he was against the measure, but from a conviction that we would go home, and thereby dissolve the convention before we would give up the question) voted also in the negative, by which that State was divided.5 Thus, Sir, on this great and important part of the system, the convention being equally divided, five States for the measure, five against, and one divided, there was a total stand, and we did not seem very likely to proceed any further. At length it was proposed, that a select committee should be ballotted for, composed of a member from each State, which committee should endeavour to devise some mode of conciliation or compromise; I had the honor to be on that committee; we met and discussed the subject of difference; the one side insisted on the inequality of suffrage in both branches, the other insisted on the equality in both; each party was tenacious of their sentiments, when it was found that nothing could induce us to yield the inequality in both branches; they at length proposed by way of compromise, if we would accede to their wishes as to the first branch, they would agree to the equal representation in the second branch. To this it was answered, that there was no merit in the proposal; it was only consenting, after they had struggled, to put both their feet on our necks, to take one of them off, provided we would consent to let them keep the other on, when they knew at the same time, that they could not put one foot on our necks, unless we would consent to it, and that by being permitted to keep on that one foot, they should afterwards be able to place the other foot on whenever they pleased. They were also called on to inform us what security they could give us should we agree to this compromise, that they would abide by the plan of government formed upon it, any longer than it suited their interest, or they found it expedient.—“The States have a right to an equality of representation. This is secured to us by our present articles of confederation, we are in possession of this privilege—It is now to be torn from us.—What security can you give us, that, when you get the power the proposed system will give you, when you have men and money, that you will not force from the States that equality of suffrage in the second branch, which you now deny to be their right, and only give up from absolute necessity? Will you tell us we ought to trust you because you now enter into a solemn compact with us? This you have done before, and now treat it with the utmost contempt.—Will you now make an appeal to the Supreme Being, and call on him to guarantee your observance of the compact? The same you have formerly done for your observance of the articles of confederation, which you are now violating in the most wanton manner! [“]The same reasons which you now urge for destroying our present federal government, may be urged for abolishing the system which you now propose to adopt; and as the method prescribed by the articles of confederation is now totally disregarded by you, as little regard may be shewn by you to the rules prescribed for the amendment of the new system,6 whenever having obtained power by the government, you shall hereafter be pleased either to discard it entirely, or so to alter it as to give yourselves all that superiority which you have now contended for, and to obtain which you have shewn yourselves disposed to hazard the union.”—Such, Sir, was the language used on that occasion, and they were told that as we could not possibly have a greater tie on them for their observance of the new system than we had for their observance of the articles of confederation, which had proved totally insufficient, it would be wrong and imprudent to confide in them.—It was further observed, that the inequality of the representation would be daily increasing—That many of the States whose territory was confined and whose population was at this time large in proportion to their territory would probably twenty, thirty, or forty years hence, have no more representatives than at the introduction of the government, whereas the States having extensive territory, where lands are to be procured cheap, would be daily encreasing in the number of their inhabitants not only from propagation but from the emigration of the inhabitants of the other States, and would have soon double, or perhaps treble the number of representatives that they are to have at first, and thereby enormously encrease their influence in the national councils. However, the majority of the select committee at length agreed to a series of propositions by way of compromise, part [149]of which related to the representation in the first branch nearly as the system is now published: And part of them to the second branch securing in that equal representation, and reported them as a compromise upon the express terms that they were wholly to be adopted or wholly to be rejected; upon this compromise, a great number of the members so far engaged themselves, that if the system was progressed upon agreeable to the terms of the compromise, they would lend it their names, by signing it, and would not actively oppose it, if their States should appear inclined to adopt it—Some, however, in which number was myself, who joined in the report and agreed to proceed upon those principles and see what kind of a system would ultimately be formed upon it, yet reserved to themselves in the most explicit manner the right of finally giving a solemn dissent to the system, if it was thought by them inconsistent with the freedom and happiness of their country—This, Sir, will account why the members of the convention so generally signed their names to the system; not because they thought it a proper one—not because they thoroughly approved, or were unanimous for it; but because they thought it better than the system attempted to be forced upon them—This, report of the select committee was after long dissension adopted by a majority of the convention, and the system was proceeded in accordingly—I believe near a fortnight, perhaps more, was spent in the discussion of this business,7 during which, we were on the verge of dissolution, scarce held together by the strength of an hair, though the public papers were announcing our extreme unanimity.8 Mr. Speaker, I think it my duty to observe, that during this struggle to prevent the large States from having all power in their hands, which had nearly terminated in a dissolution of the convention, it did not appear to me that either of those illustrious characters the Honorable Mr. Washington, or the President of the State of Pennsylvania,9 were disposed to favour the claims of the smaller States against the undue superiority attempted by the large States; on the contrary, the Honourable President of Pennsylvania was a member of the committee of compromise, and there advocated the right of the large States to an inequality in both branches and only ultimately conceded it in the second branch on the principle of conciliation, when it was found that no other terms would be accepted—This, Sir, I think it my duty to mention, for the consideration of those who endeavour to prop up a dangerous and defective system by great names; soon after this period, the Honourable Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing of New-York left us—They had uniformly opposed the system, and I believe, despairing of getting a proper one brought forward, or of rendering any real service, they returned no more10—The propositions reported by the committee of the whole house, having been fully discussed by the [150]convention, and with many alterations having been agreed to by a majority, a committee of five, were appointed to detail the system according to the principles contained in what had been agreed to by that majority—This was likely to require some time, and the convention adjourned for eight or ten days.11—Before the adjournment, I moved for liberty to be given to the different members to take correct copies of the propositions, to which the convention had then agreed, in order that during the recess of the convention, we might have an opportunity of considering them, and if it should be thought that any alterations or amendments were necessary, that we might be prepaired against the convention met to bring them forward for discussion. But, Sir, the same spirit which caused our doors to be shut—our proceedings to be kept secret—our journals to be locked up—and every avenue, as far as possible, to be shut to public information, prevailed also in this case, and the proposal so reasonable and necessary was rejected by a majority of the convention, thereby precluding even the members themselves, from the necessary means of information and deliberation on the important business in which they were engaged.12 (To be continued.) (a) On this question, Mr. Martin was the only delegate for Maryland present, which circumstance secured the State a negative. Immediately after the question had been taken, and the president had declared the votes, Mr. Jenifer came into the Convention, when Mr. King, from Massachusetts, valuing himself on Mr. Jenifer to divide the State of Maryland on this question, as he had on the former, requested of the president that the question might be put again—however the motion was too extraordinary in its nature to meet with success!"
Newspaper,No,A Marylander,,Maryland Gazette,,1/4/1788,"Mr. Hayes, I have just seen the reasons of the minority of the Pennsylvania convention for dissenting to the federal constitution,2 the preface to which is inflammatory to the last degree, as might naturally be expected in a State, divided into two great parties,3 regularly and invariably opposed to each other—an attempt is made to inflame the country people against the city of Philadelphia, the inhabitants of which and the majority of the convention are termed aristocratic and tools of despotism, for presuming to differ from them in sentiment upon an important public question; but it has been their practice, for a number of years past, to ascribe to their opponents high aristocratic prejudices for desiring to amend their defective constitution, by leaving the appointment of justices of the peace and militia officers to the executive, instead of chusing them by a popular election, and representing them as wishing to introduce an “Hoose of Loords,” because they wanted a senate, constituted like ours, to give stability to their laws, and check the ebullitions of popular caprice. The conduct of the majority in the convention, in refusing permission to the minority to enter their protest, and to have the question separately put on each article, was injudicious, reprehensible, imperious, contrary to parliamentary usage, and can only be excused by a recollection of the conduct of their opponents in the council of censors, three or four years ago, who peremptorily refused their assent to a convention to reconsider their constitution, amend it, if defective, and if not, confirm it4—they then would not hear of appealing to the people, though they now seem fond of it. I remember hearing Mr. Chambers5 observe in debate, at that time, that the constitution of Pennsylvania could not in fact, on republican principles, be considered equally sacred with that of Maryland, where more than two-thirds of the people voted for delegates to form the government, because no political test was exacted from the electors,6 whereas not one-tenth of the inhabitants of Pennsylvania voted for theirs, the non-associators being expressly precluded, and a number of the whigs having marched into the Jerseys, as militia-men.—He therefore proposed a convention, to be elected by all the freemen without distinction, now that peace was restored, to amend a government framed in the time of war, and lamented, that the non-jurors were not permitted to vote for the council of censors, because as freemen they were entitled to a share of representation in pointing out the defects [153]of the constitution, under which they lived, although in times of exigency and danger (and only then) policy required their exclusion from a share in legislation; in short he pathetically pointed out the advantages resulting from the abolition of party, and reforming their government by a convention, chosen by a clear majority of the people, but his opponents, several of whom are among the minority in the late convention, would not agree to a revision of their darling constitution, and though they now complain, that only about 13,000 out of 70,000 freemen voted for the members of convention, yet when it was remarked, that the convention for forming their government was chose by less than 10,000, they strenuously insisted, others might have voted, if they pleased, but as they rather preferred passively acquiescing in what a few should do, their neglect of duty could not reasonably operate as an objection against the constitution. This shews, that mere party men blush not at using one argument several years ago, and now entirely shifting their ground, and it is really laughable for them to lament the powers, contained in the federal constitution, of forcing into the militia persons conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, when it is remembered, that a leading member of the minority publicly, in the council of censors, declared himself against restoring the non-jurors to the rights of citizenship, or even their posterity, unless on adducing unequivocal proofs of whiggism—The same party continually harrassed the Quakers, Menonists, Dunkards, and Methodists, with exorbitant militia fines, which were rigorously collected, and at one time pretended to reinstate them in the rights of citizenship, but clogged their boon with exacting an oath, that they had not “directly or indirectly aided or abetted the King of Great-Britain, his fleets or armies,” which no conscientious man could take, who had been reluctantly compelled, at the point of the bayonet, to furnish General Howe’s army with provisions, or serve him as guides; they broke up the assembly in the fall of 1784, solely to prevent the non-jurors from being permitted to vote at elections, and the measure was not carried until their opponents had obtained a majority in the assembly, therefore the non-jurors will not be apt to coalesce with them on account of their new-born zeal for relieving them from the hardships of militia duty. I have been thus minute in the statement of facts, more properly belonging to the meridian of Pennsylvania, merely to shew the propriety and policy of deputing to a convention disinterested persons, capable of dispassionately judging for themselves and determining, whether the new constitution would promote or obstruct the happiness of the United States, and not men, hackneyed in party intrigues, or interested [154]in retaining their incomes, or local consequence by the rejection, or appreciating the public securities in their hands by the adoption of the federal government. Many of the arguments, offered by the minority, are forcible, some of them specious, and addressed to the passions rather than the reasoning faculties of the people at large, and others unanswerable, and must make an impression on impartial persons, but will make very little in Pennsylvania, because not offered by disinterested persons but those who have hitherto shewn an extravagant desire to retain the power and consequence, of their party, and uniformly objected, for ten or twelve years, to take the sense of the people about amending the glaring defects of their constitution; they have endeavoured to keep the non-jurors in a state of vassalage, thereby shewing themselves inimical to the principles of equal liberty, and made no scruple of infringing charters, solemnly and particularly guaranteed by the constitution itself—Every assemblyman, who served in convention, was in the minority. As the people of Maryland do not chuse their convention until April next, they have an opportunity of selecting men, who have made government the study of their leisure hours, and will carefully and impartially peruse the explanations of the different parts of the federal constitution, which will probably appear in the papers throughout the continent on this momentous occasion, as well as the histories of ancient and modern nations, so as to form some opinion of the causes of their prosperity and decline; every delegate should conscientiously vote his own sentiments, not blindly those of a party, or any other person, and no one should be elected, who has ever officially given an opinion, either for or against the new constitution, but above all it would be as improper to send any assemblyman, who had an hand in calling the convention, as to put a sheriff on a jury, who summoned it, or a grand jury-man, who has presented and found a bill, on a petty jury to try the fact. Baltimore, December 28, 1787."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/8/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It has been observed, Mr. Speaker, by my honorable colleagues, that the debate respecting the mode of representation, was productive of considerable warmth; this observation is true; but, Sir, it is equally true, that if we could have tamely and servilely consented to be bound in chains, and meanly condescended to assist in rivetting them fast, we might have avoided all that warmth, and have proceeded with as much calmness [157]and coolness as any stoick could have wished.—Having thus, Sir, given the honorable members of this house, a short history of some interesting parts of our proceedings, I shall beg leave to take up the system published by the convention, and shall request your indulgence, while I make some observations on different parts of it, and give you such further information as may be in my power. (Here Mr. Martin read the first section of the first article, and then proceeded.) With respect to this part of the system, Mr. Speaker, there was a diversity of sentiment; those who were for two branches in the legislature, a house of representatives and a senate, urged the necessity of a second branch to serve as a check upon the first, and used all those trite and common place arguments which are proper and just, when applied to the formation of a State government over individuals variously distinguished in their habits and manners, fortune and rank; where a body chosen in a select manner, respectable for their wealth and dignity, may be necessary, frequently to prevent the hasty and rash measures of a representation more popular; but on the other side it was urged, that none of these arguments could with propriety be applied to the formation of a federal government over a number of independent States—That it is the State governments which are to watch over and protect the rights of the individual, whether rich or poor, or of moderate circumstances, and in which the democratic and aristocratic influence or principles are to be so blended, modified, and checked as to prevent oppression and injury—That the federal government is to guard and protect the States and their rights, and to regulate their common concerns—That a federal government is formed by the States, as States that is in their sovereign capacities, in the same manner as treaties and alliances are formed—That sovereignties considered as such, cannot be said to have jarring interests or principles, the one aristocratic, and the other democratic; but that the principles of a sovereignty considered as a sovereignty, are the same, whether that sovereignty is monarchical, aristocratical, democratical, or mixed—That the history of mankind doth not furnish an instance from its earliest period to the present time, of a federal government constituted of two distinct branches—That the members of the federal government, if appointed by the States in their State capacities, that is by their legislatures, as they ought, would be select in their choice, and coming from different States, having different interests and views; this difference of interests and views, would always be a sufficient check over the whole; and it was shewn, that even Adams, who, the reviewers have justly observed, appears to be as fond of checks and balances as Lord Chesterfield of the graces, even he declares that a council consisting of one branch has always been found sufficient in a federal government.2 It was urged, that the government we were forming was not in reality a federal but a national government, not founded on the principles of the preservation, but the abolition or consolidation of all State governments—That we appeared totally to have forgot the business for which we were sent, and the situation of the country for which we were preparing our system—That we had not been sent to form a government over the inhabitants of America, considered as individuals, that as individuals they were all subject to their respective State governments, which governments would still remain, though the federal government was dissolved—That the system of government we were entrusted to prepare, was a government over these thirteen States; but that in our proceedings, we adopted principles which would be right and proper, only on the supposition that there were no State governments at all, but that all the inhabitants of this extensive continent were in their individual capacity, without government and in a state of nature—That accordingly the system proposes the legislature to consist of two branches, the one to be drawn from the people at large, immediately in their individual capacity—the other to be chose in a more select manner, as a check upon the first—It is in its very introduction declared to be a compact between the people of the United States as individuals—and it is to be ratified by the people at large in their capacity as individuals; all which it was said, would be quite right and proper, if there were no State governments, if all the people of this continent were in a state of nature, and we were forming one national government for them as individuals, and is nearly the same as was done in most of the States, when they formed their governments over the people who compose them. Whereas it was urged, that the principles on which a federal government over States ought to be constructed and ratified are the reverse—that instead of the legislature consisting of two branches, one branch was sufficient, whether examined by the dictates of reason or the experience of ages—That the representation instead of being drawn from the people at large, as individuals, ought to be drawn from the States as States in their sovereign capacity—That in a federal government, the parties to the compact are not the people as individuals, but the States as States, and that it is by the States as States in their sovereign capacity, that the system of government ought to be ratified, and not by the people as individuals. It was further said, that in a federal government over States equally free, sovereign and independent, every State ought to have an equal share in making the federal laws or regulations—in deciding upon them, and in carrying them into execution, neither of which was the case in this system, but the reverse, the States not having an equal voice in the legislature, nor in the appointment of the executive, the judges, and the other [159]officers of government—It was insisted, that in the whole system there was but one federal feature—the appointment of the senators by the States in their sovereign capacity, that is by their legislatures, and the equality of suffrage in that branch; but it was said that this feature was only federal in appearance. To prove this, and that the Senate as constituted could not be a security for the protection and preservation of the State governments, and that the senators could not be justly considered the representatives of the States as States, it was observed, that upon just principles of representation, the representative ought to speak the sentiments of his constituents, and ought to vote in the same manner that his constituents would do (as far as he can judge) provided his constituents were acting in person, and had the same knowledge and information with himself; and therefore that the representative ought to be dependant on his constituents, and answerable to them—that the connection between the representative and the represented, ought to be as near and as close as possible; according to these principles, Mr. Speaker, in this State it is provided by its constitution, that the representatives in Congress, shall be chosen annually, shall be paid by the State, and shall be subject to recall even within the year;3 so cautiously has our constitution guarded against an abuse of the trust reposed in our representatives in the federal government; whereas by the third and sixth sections of the first article of this new system, the senators are to be chosen for six years instead of being chosen annually; instead of being paid by their States who send them, they in conjunction with the other branch, are to pay themselves out of the treasury of the United States; and are not liable to be recalled during the period for which they are chosen—Thus, Sir, for six years the senators are rendered totally and absolutely independent of their States, of whom they ought to be the representatives, without any bond or tie between them—During that time they may join in measures ruinous and destructive to their States, even such as should totally annihilate their State governments, and their States cannot recall them, nor exercise any controul over them. Another consideration, Mr. Speaker, it was thought ought to have great weight to prove that the smaller States cannot depend on the senate for the preservation of their rights, either against large and ambitious States, or against an ambitious, aspiring President.—The senate, Sir, is so constituted, that they are not only to compose one branch of the legislature, but by the second section of the second article, ⟨they are to compose a privy council for the President; hence it will he necessary, that they should be, in a great measure, a permanent body, constantly residing at the seat of government.⟩4 Seven[ty] years is estimated for the life of a man; it can hardly be supposed, that a senator, especially from the States remote from the [160]seat of empire, will accept of an appointment which must estrange him for six years from his State, without giving up to a great degree his prospects in his own State. If he has a family, he will take his family with him to the place where the government shall be fixed, that will become his home, and there is every reason to expect that his future views and prospects will centre in the favours and emoluments either of the general government, or of the government of that State where the seat of empire is established:—In either case, he is lost to his own State. If he places his future prospects in the favours and emoluments of the general government, he will become the dependant and creature of the President, as the system enables a senator to be appointed to offices, and without the nomination of the President, no appointment can take place; as such, he will favour the wishes of the President, and concur in his measures, who, if he has no ambitious views of his own to gratify, may be too favourable to the ambitious views of the large States, who will have an undue share in his original appointment, and on whom he will be more dependant afterwards than on the States which are smaller. If the senator places his future prospects in that State where the seat of empire is fixed; from that time he will be in every question wherein its particular interest may be concerned the representative of that State, not of his own. But even this provision apparently for the security of the State governments, inadequate as it is, is entirely left at the mercy of the general government, for by the fourth section of the first article, it is expressly provided, that the Congress shall have a power to make and alter all regulations concerning the time and manner of holding elections for senators; a provision, expressly looking forward to, and I have no doubt designed for the utter extinction and abolition of all State governments; nor will this, I believe, be doubted by any person, when I inform you that some of the warm advocates and patrons of the system in convention, strenuously opposed the choice of the senators by the State legislatures, insisting that the State governments ought not to be introduced in any manner so as to be component parts of, or instruments for carrying into execution, the general government—Nay, so far were the friends of the system from pretending that they meant it or considered it as a federal system, that on the question being proposed, “that a union of the States, merely federal, ought to be the sole object of the exercise of the powers vested in the convention;” it was negatived by a majority of the members, and it was resolved, “that a national government ought to be formed”5—afterwards the word “national” was struck out by them, because they thought the word might tend to alarm6—and although now, they who advocate the system, pretend to call themselves federalists, in convention the distinction was just the reverse; those who opposed the system, were there considered and stiled the federal party, those who advocated it, the antifederal. Viewing it as a national, not a federal government, as calculated and designed not to protect and preserve, but to abolish and annihilate the State governments, it was opposed for the following reasons—It was said that this continent was much too extensive for one national government, which should have sufficient power and energy to pervade and hold in obedience and subjection all its parts, consistent with the enjoyment and preservation of liberty—That the genius and habits of the people of America, were opposed to such a government—That during their connection with Great-Britain, they had been accustomed to have all their concerns transacted within a narrow circle, their colonial districts—they had been accustomed to have their seats of government near them, to which they might have access, without much inconvenience when their business should require it. That at this time we find if a county is rather large, the people complain of the inconvenience, and clamour for a division of their county, or for a removal of the place where their courts are held, so as to render it more central and convenient—That in those States, the territory of which is extensive, as soon as the population encreases remote from the seat of government, the inhabitants are urgent for a removal of the seat of their government, or to be erected into a new State—As a proof of this, the inhabitants of the western parts of Virginia and North-Carolina, of Vermont and the province of Main, were instances, even the inhabitants of the western parts of Pennsylvania, who it was said already seriously look forward to the time when they shall either be erected into a new State, or have their seat of government removed to the Susquehannah.7—If the inhabitants of the different States consider it as a grievance to attend a county-court or the seat of their own government, when a little inconvenient, can it be supposed they would ever submit to have a national government established, the seat of which would be more than a thousand miles removed from some of them?—It was insisted that governments of a republican nature, are those best calculated to preserve the freedom and happiness of the citizen—That governments of this kind, are only calculated for a territory but small in its extent—That the only method by which an extensive continent like America could be connected and united together consistent with the principles of freedom, must be by having a number of strong and energetic State governments for securing and protecting the rights of the individuals forming those governments, and for regulating all their concerns; and a strong energetic federal government over those States for the protection and preservation, and for regulating the common concerns of the States.—It was further insisted, that even if it was possible to effect a total abolition of the State governments at this time, and to establish one general government over the people of America, it could not long [162]subsist, but in a little time would again be broken into a variety of governments of a smaller extent, similar in some manner to the present situation of this continent; the principal difference in all probability would be that the governments, so established, being effected by some violent convulsion, might not be formed on principles so favourable to liberty as those of our present State governments—That this ought to be an important consideration to such of the States who had excellent governments, which was the case with Maryland and most others, whatever it might be to persons who disapproving of their particular State government would be willing to hazard every thing to overturn and destroy it.—These reasons, Sir, influenced me to vote against two branches in the legislature, and against every part of the system which was repugnant to the principles of a federal government—Nor was there a single argument urged, or reason assigned, which to my mind was satisfactory, to prove that a good government on federal principles was unattainable, the whole of their arguments only proving, what none of us controverted, that our federal government as originally formed was defective and wanted amendment—However, a majority of the convention hastily and inconsiderately, without condescending to make a fair trial, in their great wisdom, decided that a kind of government which a Montesquieu and a Price have declared the best calculated of any to preserve internal liberty, and to enjoy external strength and security, and the only one by which a large continent can be connected and united consistent with the principles of liberty was totally impracticable, and they acted accordingly.8 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/11/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. With respect to that part of the second section of the first article, which relates to the apportionment of representation and direct taxation, there were considerable objections made to it, besides the great objection of inequality—It was urged, that no principle could justify taking slaves into computation in apportioning the number of representatives a State should have in the government—that it involved the absurdity of increasing the power of a State in making laws for free men in proportion as that State [170]violated the rights of freedom—That it might be proper to take slaves into consideration, when taxes were to be apportioned, because it had a tendency to discourage slavery; but to take them into account in giving representation tended to encourage the slave trade, and to make it the interest of the States to continue that infamous traffic—That slaves could not be taken into account as men, or citizens, because they were not admitted to the rights of citizens in the States which adopted or continued slavery—If they were to be taken into account as property, it was asked, what peculiar circumstance should render this property (of all others the most odious in its nature) entitled to the high privilege of conferring consequence and power in the government to its possessors, rather than any other property—and why slaves should, as property, be taken into account rather than horses, cattle, mules, or any other species—and it was observed by an honorable member from Massachusetts, that he considered it as dishonorable and humiliating to enter into compact with the slaves of the southern States, as it would be with the horses and mules of the eastern.2 It was also objected, that the numbers of representatives appointed by this section to be sent by the particular States to compose the first legislature, were not precisely agreeable to the rule of representation adopted by this system, and that the numbers in this section are artfully lessened for the large States, while the smaller States have their full proportion in order to prevent the undue influence which the large States will have in the government from being too apparent; and I think, Mr. Speaker, that this objection is well founded.—I have taken some pains to obtain information of the numbers of free men and slaves in the different States, and I have reason to believe, that if the estimate was now taken, which is directed, and one delegate to be sent for every thirty thousand inhabitants, that Virginia would have at least twelve delegates, Massachusetts eleven, and Pennsylvania ten, instead of the numbers stated in this section; whereas the other States, I believe, would not have more than the numbers there allowed them, nor would Georgia, most probably at present, send more than two—If I am right, Mr. Speaker, upon the enumeration being made, and the representation being apportioned according to the rule prescribed, the whole number of delegates would be seventy-one, thirty-six of which would be a quorum to do business; the delegates of Virginia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, would amount to thirty-three of that quorum—Those three States will, therefore, have much more than equal power and influence in making the laws and regulations, which are to affect this continent, and will have a moral certainty of preventing any laws or regulations which they disapprove, although they might be thought ever so necessary by a great majority of the States—It was further objected, that even if the States [171]who had most inhabitants ought to have a greater number of delegates, yet the number of delegates ought not to be in exact proportion to the number of inhabitants, because the influence and power of those States whose delegates are numerous, will be greater when compared to the influence and power of the other States, than the proportion which the numbers of their delegates bear to each other; as for instance, though Delaware has one delegate, and Virginia but ten, yet Virginia has more than ten times as much power and influence in the government as Delaware; to prove this, it was observed, that Virginia would have a much greater chance to carry any measure than any number of States, whose delegates were altogether ten (suppose the States of Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode-Island, and New-Hampshire) since the ten delegates from Virginia in every thing that related to the interest of that State would act in union and move one solid and compact body, whereas the delegates of these four States, though collectively equal in number to those from Virginia, coming from different States, having different interests, will be less likely to harmonize and move in concert—As a further proof it was said, that Virginia, as the system is now reported, by uniting with her the delegates of four other States, can carry a question against the sense and interest of eight States by sixty-four different combinations, the four States voting with Virginia, being every time so far different as not to be composed of the same four; whereas the State of Delaware can only, by uniting four other States with her, carry a measure against the sense of eight States by two different combinations—a mathematical proof that the State of Virginia has thirty-two times greater chance of carrying a measure against the sense of eight States than Delaware, although Virginia has only ten times as many delegates—It was also shewn, that the idea was totally fallacious which was attempted to be maintained, that if a State had one thirteenth part of the numbers composing the delegation in this system, such State would have as much influence as under the articles of confederation; to prove the fallacy of this idea it was shewn, that under the articles of confederation the State of Maryland had but one vote in thirteen, yet no measure could be carried against her interests without seven States, a majority of the whole concurring in it; whereas in this system, though Maryland has six votes, which is more than the proportion of one in thirteen, yet five States may, in a variety of combinations, carry a question against her interest, though seven other States concur with her, and six States by a much greater number of combinations, may carry a measure against Maryland, united with six other States. I shall here, Sir, just observe, that as the committee of detail reported the system, the delegates from the different States were to be one for every forty thousand inhabitants; it was afterwards altered to one for every thirty [172]thousand; this alteration was made after I left the convention, at the instance of whom I know not,3 but it is evident that the alteration is in favour of the States which have large and extensive territory to increase their power and influence in the government, and to the injury of the smaller States—Since it is the States of extensive territory, who will most speedily increase the number of their inhabitants as before has been observed, and will, therefore, most speedily procure an increase to the number of their delegates—By this alteration Virginia, North-Carolina, or Georgia, by obtaining one hundred and twenty thousand additional inhabitants, will be entitled to four additional delegates, whereas such State would only have been entitled to three, if forty thousand had remained the number by which to apportion the delegation. As to that part of this section that relates to direct taxation, there was also an objection for the following reasons—It was said that as a large sum of money was to be brought into the national treasury by the duties on commerce, which would be almost wholly paid by the commercial States, it would be unequal and unjust that the sum which was necessary to be raised by direct taxation should be apportioned equally upon all the States, obliging the commercial States to pay as large a share of the revenue arising therefrom, as the States from whom no revenue had been drawn by imposts—Since the wealth and industry of the inhabitants of the commercial States will in the first place be severely taxed through their commerce, and afterwards be equally taxed with the industry and wealth of the inhabitants of the other States, who have paid no part of that revenue, so that by this provision, the inhabitants of the commercial States are in this system obliged to bear an unreasonable and disproportionate share in the expences of the union, and the payment of that foreign and domestic debt, which was incurred not more for the benefit of the commercial than of the other States. In the sixth section of the first article, it is provided, that senators and representatives may be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, except such as shall have been created, or the emoluments of which have been increased during the time for which they were elected—Upon this subject, Sir, there was a great diversity of sentiment among the members of the convention—As the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, a senator or representative could not be appointed to any office under a particular State, or under the United States, during the time for which they were chosen, nor to any office under the United States until one year after the expiration of that time.4—It was said, and in my opinion justly, that no good reason could be assigned why a senator or representative should [173]be incapacitated to hold an office in his own government, since it can only bind him more closely to his State, and attach him the more to its interests, which, as its representative, he is bound to consult and sacredly guard as far as is consistent with the welfare of the union, and therefore, at most, would only add the additional motive of gratitude for discharging his duty; and according to this idea, the clause which prevented senators or delegates from holding offices in their own States, was rejected by a considerable majority; but, Sir, we sacredly endeavoured to preserve all that part of the resolution which prevented them from being eligible to offices under the United States, as we considered it essentially necessary to preserve the integrity, independence, and dignity of the legislature, and to secure its members from corruption. I was in the number of those who was extremely solicitous to preserve this part of the report; but there was a powerful opposition made by such who wished the members of the legislature to be eligible to offices under the United States—Three different times did they attempt to procure an alteration, and as often failed, a majority firmly adhering to the resolution as reported by the committee—However, an alteration was at length, by dint of perseverance, obtained even within the last twelve days of the convention, for it happened after I left Philadelphia5—As to the exception that they cannot be appointed to offices created by themselves, or the emoluments of which are by themselves increased, it is certainly of little consequence, since they may easily evade it by creating new offices to which may be appointed the persons who fill the offices before created, and thereby vacancies will be made which may be filled by the members who for that purpose have created the new offices. It is true, the acceptance of an office vacates their seat, nor can they be re-elected during their continuance in office; but it was said, that the evil would first take place, that the price for the office would be paid before it was obtained—that vacating the seat of the person who was appointed to office, made way for the admission of a new member, who would come there as desirous to obtain an office as him whom he succeeded, and as ready to pay the price necessary to obtain it; in fine, that it would be only driving away the flies who were filled to make room for those that were hungry—And as the system is now reported, the president having the power to nominate to all offices, it must be evident, that there is no possible security for the integrity and independence of the legislature, but that they are most unduly placed under the influence of the president and exposed to bribery and corruption. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/15/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. The seventh section of this article [i.e., Article I] was also the subject of contest.—It was thought by many members of the convention, that it was very wrong to confine the origination of all revenue bills to the house of representatives, since the members of the senate will be chosen by the people as well as the members of the house of delegates, if not immediately, yet mediately, being chosen by the members of the State legislature, which members are elected by the people, and that it makes no real difference whether a person doth a thing in person, or by a deputy, or agent, appointed by him for that purpose. That no argument can be drawn from the house of Lords in the British constitution, since they are neither mediately or immediately the representatives of the people, but are one of the three estates, composing that kingdom, having hereditary rights and privileges distinct from, and independent of, the people. That it may, and probably will be a fruitful source of dispute and controversy between the two branches, what are, or are not, revenue bills, and the more so, as they are not defined in the constitution; which controversies may be difficult to settle, and may become serious in their consequences, there being no power in the constitution to decide upon, or authorised in cases of absolute necessity to terminate them by a prorogation or dissolution of either of the branches; a remedy provided in the British constitution, where the King has that power, which has been found necessary at times to be exercised in case of violent dissentions between the Lords and Commons on the subject of money bills. That every regulation of commerce—every law relative to excises—stamps—the post-office—the imposition of taxes, and their collection—the creation of courts and offices;—in fine, every law for the union, if enforced by any pecuniary sanctions, as they would tend to bring money into the continental treasury, might and probably would be considered a revenue act—That consequently the senate, the members of whom will probably be the most select in their choice, and consist of men the most enlightened and of the greatest abilities, who from the duration of their appointment, and the permanency of their body, will probably be best acquainted with the common concerns of the States, and with the means of providing for them, will be rendered almost useless as a part of the legislature; and that they will have but little to do in that capacity, except patiently to wait the proceedings of the house of representatives, and afterwards examine and approve, or propose amendments. There were also objections to that part of this section which relates to the negative of the president. There were some who thought no good reason could be assigned for giving the president a negative of any kind—Upon the principle of a check to the proceedings of the legislature, it was said to be unnecessary—That the two branches having a controul over each others proceedings—and the senate being chosen by the State legislatures, and being composed of members from the different States, there would always be a sufficient guard against measures being hastily or rashly adopted. That the president was not likely to have more wisdom or integrity than the senators, or any of them, or to better know or consult the interest of the States, than any member of the senate, so as to be entitled to a negative on that principle—And as to the precedent from the British constitution (for we were eternally troubled with arguments and precedents from the British government) it was said it would not apply. The King of Great-Britain there composed one of the three estates of the kingdom—he was possessed of rights and privileges, as such, distinct from the Lords and Commons; rights and privileges which descended to his heirs, and were inheritable by them; that for the preservation of these it was necessary he should have a negative, but that this was not the case with the president of the United States, who was no more than an officer of government, the sovereignty of which was not in him, but in the legislature—And it was further urged, even if he was allowed a negative, it ought not to be of so great extent as that given by the system, since his single voice is to countervail the whole of either branch, and any number less than two-thirds of the other; however, a majority of the convention was of a different opinion, and adopted as it now makes a part of the system. By the eighth section of this article, Congress is to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.—When we met in convention after our adjournment, to receive the report of the committee of detail, the members of that committee were requested to inform us what powers were meant to be vested in Congress by the word duties in this section, since the word imposts extended to duties on goods imported, and by another part of the system no duties on exports were to be laid.—In answer to this inquiry we were informed, that it was meant to give the general government the power of laying stamp duties on paper, parchment and vellum. We then proposed to have the power inserted in express words, least disputes hereafter might arise on the subject, and that the meaning might be understood by all who were to be affected by it; but to this it was objected, because it was said that the word stamp would probably sound odiously in the ears of many of the inhabitants, and be a cause of objection. By the power of imposing stamp duties the Congress will have a right to declare that no wills, deeds, or other instruments of writing shall be good and valid, without being stamped—that without being reduced to writing and being stamped, no bargain, sale, transfer of property, or contract of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be binding; and also that no exemplifications of records, depositions, or probates of any kind shall be received in evidence, unless they have the same solemnity—They may likewise oblige all proceedings of a judicial nature to be stamped to give them effect—those stamp duties may be imposed to any amount they please, and under the pretence of securing the collection of these duties, and to prevent the laws which imposed them from being evaded, the Congress may bring the decision of all questions relating to the conveyance, disposition and rights of property and every question relating to contracts between man and man into the courts of the general government.—Their inferior courts in the first instance and the superior court by appeal. By the power to lay and collect imposts, they may impose duties on any or every article of commerce imported into these States to what amount they please. By the power to lay excises, a power very odious in its nature, since it authorises officers to go into your houses, your kitchens, your cellars, and to examine into your private concerns, the Congress may impose duties on every article of use or consumption, on the food that we eat—on the liquors we drink—on the cloathes that we wear—the glass which enlighten our houses—or the hearths necessary for our warmth and comfort. By the power to lay and collect taxes, they may proceed to direct taxation on every individual either by a capitation tax on their heads, or an assessment on their property. By this part of the section therefore, the government has a power to lay what duties they please on goods imported—to lay what duties they please [180]afterwards on whatever we use or consume—to impose stamp duties to what amount they please, and in whatever cases they please—afterwards to impose on the people direct taxes, by capitation tax, or by assessment, to what amount they choose, and thus to sluice them at every vein as long as they have a drop of blood, without any controul, limitation or restraint—while all the officers for collecting these taxes, stamp duties, imposts and excises, are to be appointed by the general government, under its direction, not accountable to the States; nor is there even a security that they shall be citizens of the respective States, in which they are to exercise their offices; at the same time the construction of every law imposing any and all these taxes and duties, and directing the collection of them, and every question arising thereon, and on the conduct of the officers appointed to execute these laws, and to collect these taxes and duties so various in their kinds, are taken away from the courts of justice of the different States, and confined to the courts of the general government, there to be heard and determined by judges holding their offices under the appointment not of the States, but of the general government.⟩2 Many of the members, and myself in the number, thought that the States were much better judges of the circumstances of their citizens, and what sum of money could be collected from them by direct taxation, and of the manner in which it could be raised, with the greatest ease and convenience to their citizens, than the general government could be; and that the general government ought not in any case to have the power of laying direct taxes, but in that of the delinquency of a State. Agreeable to this sentiment, I brought in a proposition on which a vote of the convention was taken. The proposition was as follows: “And wherever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue should be raised by direct taxation, having apportioned the same by the above rule, requisitions shall be made of the respective States to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas within a time in the said requisition to be specified, and in case of any of the States failing to comply with such requisition, then and then only, to have power to devise and pass acts directing the mode and authorising the collection of the same.”3 Had this proposition been acceded to, the dangerous and oppressive power in the general government of imposing direct taxes on the inhabitants, which it now enjoys in all cases, would have been only vested in it in case of the non-compliance of a State, as a punishment for its delinquency, and would have ceased that moment that the State complied with the requisition—But the proposition was rejected by a majority, consistent with their aim and desire of encreasing the power of the general government as far as possible, and destroying the powers and influence of the States—And though there is a provision that all duties, imposts and [181]excises shall be uniform, that is, to be laid to the same amount on the same articles in each State, yet this will not prevent Congress from having it in their power to cause them to fall very unequal and much heavier on some States than on others, because these duties may be laid on articles but little or not at all used in some States, and of absolute necessity for the use and consumption of others, in which case the first would pay little or no part of the revenue arising therefrom, while the whole or nearly the whole of it would be paid by the last, to wit, the States which use and consume the articles on which the imposts and excises are laid.} By our original articles of confederation, the Congress have a power to borrow money and emit bills of credit on the credit of the United States—Agreeable to which was the report on this system as made by the committee of detail. When we came to this part of the report a motion was made to strike out the words “to emit bills of credit;” against the motion we urged, that it would be improper to deprive the Congress of that power—that it would be a novelty unprecedented to establish a government which should not have such authority—That it was impossible to look forward into futurity so far as to decide that events might not happen that should render the exercise of such a power absolutely necessary—And that we doubted whether if a war should take place it would be possible for this country to defend itself without having recourse to paper credit, in which case there would be a necessity of becoming a prey to our enemies, or violating the constitution of our government; and that considering the administration of the government would be principally in the hands of the wealthy there could be little reason to fear an abuse of the power by an unnecessary or injurious exercise of it—But, Sir, a majority of the convention, being wise beyond every possible event, and being willing to risque any political evil rather than admit the idea of a paper emission, in any possible event, refused to trust this authority to a government, to which they were lavishing the most unlimited powers of taxation, and to the mercy of which they were willing blindly to trust the liberty and property of the citizens of every State in the union; and they erased that clause from the system.—⟨Among other powers given to this government in the eighth section it has that of appointing tribunals inferior to the supreme court; to this power there was an opposition. It was urged that there was no occasion for inferior courts of the general government to be appointed in the different States, and that such ought not to be admitted—That the different State judiciaries in the respective States would be competent to, and sufficient for, the cognizance in the first instance of all cases that should arise under the laws of the general government, which being by this system made [182]the supreme law of the States, would be binding on the different State judiciaries—That by giving an appeal to the supreme court of the United States, the general government would have a sufficient check over their decisions, and security for the enforcing of their laws—That to have inferior courts appointed under the authority of Congress in the different States, would eventually absorb and swallow up the State judiciaries, by drawing all business from them to the courts of the general government, which the extensive and undefined powers, legislative and judicial, of which it is possessed, would easily enable it to do—That it would unduly and dangerously encrease the weight and influence of Congress in the several States, be productive of a prodigious number of officers, and be attended with an enormous additional and unnecessary expence—That the judiciaries of the respective States not having power to decide upon the laws of the general government, but the determination on those laws being confined to the judiciaries appointed under the authority of Congress in the first instance, as well as on appeal, there would be a necessity for judges or magistrates of the general government, and those to a considerable number, in each county of every State—That there would be a necessity for courts to be holden by them in each county and that these courts would stand in need of all their proper officers such as sheriffs, clerks and others commissioned, under the authority of the general government—In fine, that the administration of justice, as it will relate to the laws of the general government would require in each State all the magistrates, courts, officers and expence, which is now found necessary in the respective States for the administration of justice as it relates to the laws of the State governments.—But here again we were overruled by a majority, who assuming it as a principle that the general government and the State governments (as long as they should exist) would be at perpetual variance and enmity, and that their interests would constantly be opposed to each other, insisted for that reason that the State judges being citizens of their respective States, and holding their commission under them, ought not though acting on oath, to be entrusted in the administration of the laws of the general government.⟩4 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Caveto,,Maryland Gazette,,1/15/1788,"The beginnings of arbitrary government are always light and easy, and its first steps are slow and leisurely; but if power be suffered to spread itself and take root, and if it be not betimes opposed, it grows at last irresistible; for a thousand circumstances concur to hinder the people from recovering any ground they have once lost; their friends are commonly divided among one another; corruption intervenes, or wealth makes them timorous. Their enemies agree in any mischief; the means of corrupting is in their hands; they are liable to few fears, as having much to get and little to lose; so that they who love their country, have been generally found to be but a disjointed and weak party, to withstand those whom ambition emboldens, and interested views influence and unite."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/18/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. By the eighth section, of the first article, the Congress have also a power given them to raise and support armies without any limitation as to numbers, and without any restriction in time of peace. Thus, Sir, this plan of government, instead of guarding against a standing army, that engine of arbitrary power, which has so often and so successfully been used for the subversion of freedom, has, in its formation, given it an express and [188]constitutional sanction, and hath provided for its introduction; nor could this be prevented: I took the sense of the convention on a proposition, by which the Congress should not have power, in time of peace, to keep embodied more than a certain number of regular troops—that number to be ascertained by what should be considered a respectable peace establishment.—This proposition was rejected by a majority,2 it being their determination, that the power of Congress to keep up a standing army, even in peace should only be restrained by their will and pleasure. This section proceeds further to give a power to the Congress to provide for calling forth the militia, to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.—As to giving such a power there was no objection; but it was thought by some, that this power ought to be given with certain restrictions—It was thought that not more than a certain part of the militia, of any one State, ought to be obliged to march out of the same, or be employed out of the same, at any one time, without the consent of the legislature of such State—This amendment I endeavoured to obtain;3 but it met with the same fate, which attended almost every attempt to limit the powers given to the general government, and constitutionally to guard against their abuse, it was not adopted.—As it now stands, the Congress will have the power, if they please, to march the whole militia of Maryland to the remotest part of the union, and keep them in service as long as they think proper, without being in any respect dependant upon the Government of Maryland for this unlimited exercise of power over its citizens.—All of whom, from the lowest to the greatest, may, during such service, be subjected to military law, and tied up and whipped at the halbert like the meanest of slaves. By the next paragraph, Congress is to have the power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States.— For this extraordinary provision, by which the militia, the only defence and protection which the States can have for the security of their rights against arbitrary encroachments of the general government, is taken entirely out of the power of their respective States, and placed under the power of Congress, it was speciously assigned as a reason, that the general government would cause the militia to be better regulated and better disciplined than the State governments, and that it would be proper for the whole militia of the union, to have a uniformity in their arms and exercise.—To this it was answered, that the reason, however specious, was not just;—that it would be absurd the militia of the western settlements, who were exposed to an Indian enemy, should either be confined to the same arms or exercise, as the militia of the eastern or middle States—that the same penalties which would be sufficient to enforce [189]an obedience to militia laws in some States, would be totally disregarded in others—That leaving the power to the several States, they would respectively best know the situation and circumstances of their citizens, and the regulations that would be necessary and sufficient to effect a well regulated militia in each—That we were satisfied the militia had heretofore been as well disciplined, as if they had been under the regulations of Congress; and that the States would now have an additional motive to keep their militia well disciplined, and fit for service, as it would be their only chance to preserve there [i.e., their] existence against a general government, armed with powers sufficient to destroy them.—These observations, Sir, procured from some of the members an open avowal of those reasons, by which we believed before that they were actuated—They said, that as the States would be opposed to the general government, and at enmity with it, which as I before observed, they assumed as a principle, if the militia was under the controul and the authority of the respective States, it would enable them to thwart and oppose the general government:—They said the States ought to be at the mercy of the general government, and, therefore, that the militia ought to be put under its power, and not suffered to remain under the power of the respective States.—In answer to these declarations, it was urged, that if after having obtained to the general government the great powers already granted, and among those, that of raising and keeping up regular troops without limitation, the power over the militia should be taken away from the States, and also given to the general government, it ought to be considered as the last coup de grace to the State governments; that it must be the most convincing proof, the advocates of this system design the destruction of the State governments, and that no professions, to the contrary, ought to be trusted; and that every State in the union, ought to reject such a system with indignation, since, if the general government should attempt to oppress and enslave them, they could not have any possible means of self defence; because the proposed system, taking away from the States the right of organizing, arming and disciplining the militia, the first attempt made by a State to put the militia in a situation to counteract the arbitrary measures of the general government, would be construed into an act of rebellion, or treason; and Congress would instantly march their troops into the State.—It was further observed, that when a government wishes to deprive their citizens of freedom, and reduce them to slavery, it generally makes use of a standing army for that purpose, and leaves the militia in a situation as contemptible as possible, least [i.e., lest] they might oppose its arbitrary designs—That in this system, we give the general government every provision it could wish for, and even invite it to subvert the liberties of the States and their [190]citizens, since we give them the right to encrease and keep up a standing army as numerous as it would wish, and by placing the militia under its power, enable it to leave the militia totally unorganized, undisciplined, and even to disarm them;4 while the citizens, so far from complaining of this neglect, might even esteem it a favour in the general government, as thereby they would be freed from the burthen of militia duties, and left to their own private occupations or pleasures.—However, all arguments, and every reason that could be urged on this subject, as well as on many others, were obliged to yield to one that was unanswerable, a majority upon the division. By the ninth section of this article, the importation of such persons as any of the States now existing, shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding ten dollars for each person. The design of this clause is to prevent the general government from prohibiting the importation of slaves, but the same reasons which caused them to strike out the word “national,” and not admit the word “stamps,” influenced them here to guard against the word “slaves,” they anxiously sought to avoid the admission of expressions which might be odious in the ears of Americans, although they were very willing to admit into their system those things which the expressions signified: And hence it is, that the clause is so worded, as really to authorise the general government to impose a duty of ten dollars on every foreigner who comes into a State to become a citizen, whether he comes absolutely free, or qualifiedly so as a servant—although this is contrary to the design of the framers, and the duty was only meant to extend to the importation of slaves. This clause was the subject of a great diversity of sentiment in the convention;—as the system was reported by the committee of detail, the provision was general, that such importation should not be prohibited, without confining it to any particular period.—This was rejected by eight States—Georgia, South-Carolina, and I think North-Carolina voting for it.5 We were then told by the delegates of the two first of those States, that their States would never agree to a system which put it in the power of the general government to prevent the importation of slaves, and that they, as delegates from those States, must withhold their assent from such a system. A committee of one member from each State was chosen by ballot, to take this part of the system under their consideration, and to endeavour to agree upon some report which should reconcile those States;—to this committee also was referred the following proposition, [191]which had been reported by the committee of detail, to wit, “No navigation act shall be passed without the assent of two-thirds of the members present in each house;” a proposition which the staple and commercial States were solicitous to retain, lest their commerce should be placed too much under the power of the eastern States, but which these last States were as anxious to reject.—This committee, of which also I had the honour to be a member, met and took under their consideration the subjects committed to them; I found the eastern States, notwithstanding their aversion to slavery, were very willing to indulge the southern States, at least with a temporary liberty to prosecute the slave trade, provided the southern States would in their turn gratify them, by laying no restriction on navigation acts; and after a very little time, the committee, by a great majority, agreed on a report, by which the general government was to be prohibited from preventing the importation of slaves for a limited time, and the restrictive clause relative to navigation acts was to be omitted.6 This report was adopted by a majority of the convention, but not without considerable opposition.—It was said, that we had but just assumed a place among independent nations, in consequence of our opposition to the attempts of Great-Britain to enslave us—that this opposition was grounded upon the preservation of those rights, to which God and Nature had entitled us, not in particular, but in common with all the rest of mankind—That we had appealed to the Supreme Being for his assistance, as the God of freedom, who could not but approve our efforts to preserve the rights which he had thus imparted to his creatures—that now, when we scarcely had risen from our knees, from supplicating his aid and protection—in forming our government over a free people, a government formed pretendedly on the principles of liberty and for its preservation,—in that government to have a provision, not only putting it out of its power to restrain and prevent the slave trade, but even encouraging that most infamous traffic, by giving the States power and influence in the union, in proportion as they cruelly and wantonly sport with the rights of their fellow creatures, ought to be considered as a solemn mockery of, and insult to, that God whose protection we had then implored, and could not fail to hold us up in detestation, and render us contemptible to every true friend of liberty in the world.—It was said, it ought to be considered that national crimes can only be, and frequently are, punished in this world by national punishments, and that the continuance of the slave trade, and thus giving it a national sanction and encouragement, ought to be considered as justly exposing us to the displeasure and vengeance of Him, who is equal Lord of all, and who views with equal eye, the poor African slave and his American master!

Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,Landholder,Maryland Gazette,,1/18/1788,"Mr. WILLIAM GODDARD: Sir, As the Publication under the Signature of the CONNECTICUT LANDHOLDER, is circulating remote from the place of Mr. Gerry’s residence, and is calculated not only to injure that honourable gentleman in his private character, but also to weaken the effect of his opposition to the government proposed by the late convention, and thereby promote the adoption of a system, which I consider destructive of the rights and liberties of the respective states, and of their citizens; I beg leave, through the channel of your Paper, to declare to the Public, that from the time I took my seat in convention, which was early in June, until the fourth day of September, when I left Philadelphia, I am satisfied I was not ten minutes absent from convention while sitting (excepting only five days in the beginning of August, immediately after the committee of detail had reported, during which but little business was done.)1 That during my attendance, I never heard Mr. Gerry, or any other member, introduce a proposition for the redemption of continental money according to its nominal, or any other value, nor did I ever hear that such a proposition had been offered to consideration, or had been thought of. I was intimate with Mr. Gerry, and never heard him express in private conversation, or otherwise, a wish for the redemption of continental money, or assign the want of such a provision as a defect—Nor did I ever hear in convention, or any where else, such a motive of conduct attributed to Mr. Gerry.2 I also declare to the Public, that a considerable time before I left the convention, Mr. Gerry’s opposition to the system was warm and decided—that in a particular manner he strenuously opposed that provision by which the power and authority over the militia is taken away from the states and given to the general government—that in the debate he declared, if that measure was adopted, it would be the most convincing proof that the destruction of the state governments, and the introduction of a King was designed, and that no declarations to the contrary ought to be credited, since it was giving the states the last coup de grace, by taking from them the only means of self-preservation.3 The conduct of the advocates and framers of this system, towards the thirteen states, in pretending it was designed for their advantage, and gradually obtaining power after power to the general government, which could not but end in their slavery, he compared to the conduct of a number of jockeys, who had thirteen young colts to break—they begin with the appearance of kindness, giving them a lock of hay, or a handful of oats, and stroaking them while they eat, until being rendered sufficiently gentle, they suffer a halter to be put round their necks—obtaining a further degree of their confidence, the jockeys slip, a curb bridle on their heads, and the bit into their mouths, after which the saddle follows of course, and well booted and spurred, with good whips in their hands, they mount and ride them at their pleasure, and although they may kick and flounce a little at first, not being able to get clear of their riders, they soon become as tame and passive as their masters could wish them. In the course of public debate in the convention, Mr. Gerry applied to the system of government, as then under discussion, the words of Pope with respect to vice, “that it was a monster of such horrid mien, as to be hated need but to be seen.”4 And some time before I left Philadelphia, he in the same public manner, declared in convention, that he should consider himself a traitor to his country, if he did not oppose the system there, and also when he left the convention. These, Sir, are facts which I do not fear being contradicted by any member of the convention, and will, I apprehend, satisfactorily shew that Mr. Gerry’s opposition proceeded from a conviction in his own mind, that the government, if adopted, would terminate in the destruction of the states, and in the introduction of a kingly government. I am, Sir, your very obedient servant, Baltimore, January 13, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/22/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. It was urged that by this system, we were giving the general government full and absolute power to regulate commerce, under which general power it would have a right to restrain, or totally prohibit the slave trade—it must appear to the world absurd and disgraceful to the last degree, that we should except from the exercise of that power, the only branch of commerce, which is unjustifiable in its nature, and contrary to the rights of mankind—That on the contrary, we ought rather to prohibit expressly in our constitution, the further importation of slaves; and to authorize the general government from time to time, to make such regulations as should be thought most advantageous for the gradual abolition of slavery, and the emancipation of the slaves which are already in the States. That slavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind, and habituates us to tyranny and oppression.—It was further urged, that by this system of government, every State is to be protected both from foreign invasion and from domestic insurrections; that from this consideration, it was of the utmost importance it should have a power to restrain the importation of slaves, since in proportion as the number of slaves were encreased in any State, in the same proportion the State is weakened and exposed to foreign invasion, or domestic insurrection, and by so much the less will it be able to protect itself against either; and therefore will by so much the more, want aid from, and be a burthen to, the union.—It was further said, that as in this system we were giving the general government a power under the idea of national character, or national interest, to regulate even our weights and measures, and have prohibited all possibility of emitting paper money, and passing instalment laws, &c.—It must appear still more extraordinary, that we should prohibit the government from interfering with the slave trade, than which nothing could so materially affect both our national honour and interest.—These reasons influenced me both on the committee and in convention, most decidedly to oppose and vote against the clause, as it now makes a part of the system.2 You will perceive, Sir, not only that the general government is prohibited from interfering in the slave trade before the year eighteen hundred and eight, but that there is no provision in the constitution that it shall afterwards be prohibited, nor any security that such prohibition will ever take place—and I think there is great reason to believe that if the importation of slaves is permitted until the year seventeen [i.e., [197]eighteen] hundred and eight, it will not be prohibited afterwards—At this time we do not generally hold this commerce in so great abhorrence as we have done.—When our own liberties were at stake, we warmly felt for the common rights of men3—The danger being thought to be past, which threatened ourselves, we are daily growing more insensible to those rights—In those States who have restrained or prohibited the importation of slaves, it is only done by legislative acts which may be repealed—When those States find that they must in their national character and connection suffer in the disgrace, and share in the inconveniences attendant upon that detestable and iniquitous traffic, they may be desirous also to share in the benefits arising from it, and the odium attending it will be greatly effaced by the sanction which is given to it in the general government. By the next paragraph, the general government is to have a power of suspending the habeas corpus act, in cases of rebellion or invasion. As the State governments have a power of suspending the habeas corpus act, in those cases, it was said there could be no good reason for giving such a power to the general government, since whenever the State which is invaded or in which an insurrection takes place, finds its safety requires it, it will make use of that power—And it was urged, that if we gave this power to the general government, it would be an engine of oppression in its hands, since whenever a State should oppose its views, however arbitrary and unconstitutional, and refuse submission to them, the general government may declare it to be an act of rebellion, and suspending the habeas corpus act, may seize upon the persons of those advocates of freedom, who have had virtue and resolution enough to excite the opposition, and may imprison them during its pleasure in the remotest part of the union, so that a citizen of Georgia might be bastiled in the furthest part of New-Hampshire—or a citizen of New-Hampshire in the furthest extreme to the south, cut off from their family, their friends, and their every connection—These considerations induced me, Sir, to give my negative also to this clause.4 In this same section there is a provision that no preference shall be given to the ports of one State over another, and that vessels bound to or from one State shall not be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties in another.—This provision, as well as that which relates to the uniformity of impost duties and excises, was introduced, Sir, by the delegation of this State.5—Without such a provision it would have been in the power of the general government to have compelled all ships sailing into, or out of the Chesapeak, to clear and enter at Norfolk or some port in Virginia—a regulation which would be extremely injurious to our commerce, but which would if considered merely as to the interest of the [198]union, perhaps not be thought unreasonable, since it would render the collection of the revenue arising from commerce more certain and less expensive. But, Sir, as the system is now reported, the general government have a power to establish what ports they please in each State, and to ascertain at what ports in every State ships shall clear and enter in such State, a power which may be so used as to destroy the effect of that provision, since by it may be established a port in such a place as shall be so inconvenient to the State as to render it more eligible for their shipping to clear and enter in another than in their own State; suppose, for instance the general government should determine that all ships which cleared or entered in Maryland, should clear and enter at George-Town, on Potowmack, it would oblige all the ships which sailed from, or was bound to, any other part of Maryland, to clear or enter in some port in Virginia. To prevent such a use of the power which the general government now has of limiting the number of ports in a State, and fixing the place or places where they shall be, we endeavoured to obtain a provision that the general government should only, in the first instance, have authority to ascertain the number of ports proper to be established in each State, and transmit information thereof to the several States, the legislatures of which, respectively, should have the power to fix the places where those ports should be, according to their idea of what would be most advantageous to the commerce of their State, and most for the ease and convenience of their citizens; and that the general government should not interfere in the establishment of the places, unless the legislature of the State should neglect or refuse so to do; but we could not obtain this alteration.6 By the tenth section, every State is prohibited from emitting bills of credit—As it was reported by the committee of detail, the States were only prohibited from emitting them without the consent of Congress;7 but the convention was so smitten with the paper money dread, that they insisted the prohibition should be absolute. It was my opinion, Sir, that the States ought not to be totally deprived of the right to emit bills of credit, and that as we had not given an authority to the general government for that purpose, it was the more necessary to retain it in the States—I considered that this State, and some others, have formerly received great benefit from paper emissions, and that if public and private credit should once more be restored, such emissions may hereafter be equally advantageous; and further, that it is impossible to foresee that events may not take place which shall render paper money of absolute necessity; and it was my opinion, if this power was not to be exercised by a State without the permission of the general government, it ought to be satisfactory [199]even to those who were the most haunted by the apprehensions of paper money; I, therefore, thought it my duty to vote against this part of the system.8 The same section also, puts it out of the power of the States, to make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, or to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts. I considered, Sir, that there might be times of such great public calamities and distress, and of such extreme scarcity of specie as should render it the duty of a government for the preservation of even the most valuable part of its citizens in some measure to interfere in their favour, by passing laws totally or partially stopping the courts of justice—or authorising the debtor to pay by instalments, or by delivering up his property to his creditors at a reasonable and honest valuation.—The times have been such as to render regulations of this kind necessary in most, or all of the States, to prevent the wealthy creditor and the monied man from totally destroying the poor though even industrious debtor—Such times may again arrive.—I therefore, voted against depriving the States of this power,9 a power which I am decided they ought to possess, but which I admit ought only to be exercised on very important and urgent occasions.—I apprehend, Sir, the principal cause of complaint among the people at large is, the public and private debt with which they are oppressed, and which, in the present scarcity of cash, threatens them with destruction, unless they can obtain so much indulgence in point of time that by industry and frugality they may extricate themselves. This government proposed, I apprehend so far from removing will greatly encrease those complaints, since grasping in its all powerful hand the citizens of the respective States, it will by the imposition of the variety of taxes, imposts, stamps, excises and other duties, squeeze from them the little money they may acquire, the hard earnings of their industry, as you would squeeze the juice from an orange, till not a drop more can be extracted, and then let loose upon them, their private creditors, to whose mercy it consigns them, by whom their property is to be seized upon and sold in this scarcity of specie at a sheriffs sale, where nothing but ready cash can be received for a tenth part of its value, and themselves and their families to be consigned to indigence and distress, without their governments having a power to give them a moment’s indulgence, however necessary it might be, and however desirous to grant them aid. By this same section, every State is also prohibited from laying any imposts, or duties on imports or exports, without the permission of the general government.—It was urged, that as almost all sources of taxation were given to Congress it would be but reasonable to leave the States the power of bringing revenue into their treasuries, by laying a [200]duty on exports if they should think proper, which might be so light as not to injure or discourage industry, and yet might be productive of considerable revenue—Also, that there might be cases in which it would be proper, for the purpose of encouraging manufactures, to lay duties to prohibit the exportation of raw materials, and even in addition to the duties laid by Congress on imports for the sake of revenue, to lay a duty to discourage the importation of particular articles into a State, or to enable the manufacturer here to supply us on as good terms as they could be obtained from a foreign market; however, the most we could obtain was, that this power might be exercised by the States with, and only with the consent of Congress, and subject to its controul—And so anxious were they to seize on every shilling of our money for the general government, that they insisted even the little revenue that might thus arise, should not be appropriated to the use of the respective States where it was collected, but should be paid into the treasury of the United States; and accordingly it is so determined.10 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,1/29/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. The second article, relates to the executive—his mode of election—his powers—and the length of time he should continue in office. On these subjects, there was a great diversity of sentiment—Many of the members were desirous that the president should be elected for seven years, and not to be eligible a second time—others proposed [213]that he should not be absolutely ineligible, but that he should not be capable of being chosen a second time, until the expiration of a certain number of years—The supporter of the above propositions, went upon the idea that the best security for liberty was a limited duration and a rotation of office in the chief executive department. There was a party who attempted to have the president appointed during good behaviour, without any limitation as to time, and not being able to succeed in that attempt, they then endeavoured to have him re-eligible without any restraint.—It was objected that the choice of a president to continue in office during good behaviour, would be at once rendering our system an elective monarchy—and, that if the president was to be re-eligible without any interval of disqualification, it would amount nearly to the same thing, since with the powers that the president is to enjoy, and the interest and influence with which they will be attended, he will be almost absolutely certain of being re-elected from time to time, as long as he lives—As the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, the president was to be chosen for seven years, and not to be eligible at any time after—In the same manner the proposition was agreed to in convention, and so was it reported by the committee of detail, although a variety of attempts were made to alter that part of the system by those who were of a contrary opinion, in which they repeatedly failed; but, Sir, by never losing sight of their object, and choosing a proper time for their purpose, they succeeded at length in obtaining the alteration, which was not made until within the last twelve days before the convention adjourned.2 As the propositions were agreed to by the committee of the whole house, the president was to be appointed by the national legislature, and as it was reported by the committee of detail, the choice was to be made by ballot in such a manner, that the States should have an equal voice in the appointment of this officer, as they, of right, ought to have; but those who wished as far as possible to establish a national instead of a federal government, made repeated attempts to have the president chosen by the people at large; on this the sense of the convention was taken, I think not less than three times while I was there, and as often rejected;3 but within the last fortnight of their session, they obtained the alteration in the manner it now stands, by which the large States have a very undue influence in the appointment of the president.—There is no case where the States will have an equal voice in the appointment of the president, except where two persons shall have each an equal number of votes, and those a majority of the whole number of electors, a case very unlikely to happen, or where no person has a [214]majority of the votes; in these instances the house of representatives are to choose by ballot, each State having an equal voice, but they are confined in the last instance to the five who have the greatest number of votes, which gives the largest States a very unequal chance of having the president chose under their nomination. As to the vice-president, that great officer of government, who is in case of death, resignation, removal or inability of the president, to supply his place, and be vested with his powers, and who is officially to be the president of the senate, there is no provision by which a majority of the voices of the electors are necessary for his appointment, but after it is decided who is chosen president, that person who has the next greatest number of votes of the electors, is declared to be legally elected to the vice-presidency, so that by this system it is very possible, and not improbable, that he may be appointed by the electors of a single large State; and a very undue influence in the senate is given to that State of which the vice-president, is a citizen, since in every question where the senate is divided that State will have two votes, the president having on those occasions a casting voice.—Every part of the system which relates to the vice-president, as well as the present mode of electing the president, was introduced and agreed upon after I left Philadelphia. Objections were made to that part of this article, by which the president is appointed commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, and it was wished to be so far restrained, that he should not command in person; but this could not be obtained.4—The power given to the president of granting reprieves and pardons, was also thought extremely dangerous, and as such opposed—The president thereby has the power of pardoning those who are guilty of treason, as well as of other offences; it was said that no treason was so likely to take place as that in which the president himself might be engaged—the attempt to assume to himself powers not given by the constitution, and establish himself in regal authority—in which attempt a provision is made for him to secure from punishment the creatures of his ambition, the associates and abettors of his treasonable practices, by granting them pardons should they be defeated in their attempts to subvert the constitution. To that part of this article also, which gives the president a right to nominate, and with the consent of the senate to appoint all the officers, civil and military, of the United States, there were considerable opposition—it was said that the person who nominates, will always in reality appoint, and that this was giving the president a power and influence which together with the other powers, bestowed upon him, would place him above all restraint and controul. In fine, it was urged, that the [215]president as here constituted, was a king in every thing but the name—that though he was to be chosen but for a limited time, yet at the expiration of that time if he is not re-elected, it will depend entirely upon his own moderation whether he will resign that authority with which he has once been invested—that from his having the appointment of all the variety of officers in every part of the civil department for the union, who will be very numerous—in them and their connexions, relations, friends and dependants, he will have a formidable host devoted to his interest, and ready to support his ambitious views.—That the army and navy, which may be encreased without restraint as to numbers, the officers of which from the highest to the lowest, are all to be appointed by him and dependant on his will and pleasure, and commanded by him in person, will, of course, be subservient to his wishes, and ready to execute his commands; in addition to which, the militia also are entirely subjected to his orders—That these circumstances, combined together, will enable him, when he pleases, to become a king in name, as well as in substance, and establish himself in office not only for his own life, but even if he chooses, to have that authority perpetuated to his family. It was further observed, that the only appearance of responsibility in the president, which the system holds up to our view, is the provision for impeachment; but that when we reflect that he cannot be impeached but by the house of delegates, and that the members of this house are rendered dependant upon, and unduly under the influence of the president, by being appointable to offices of which he has the sole nomination, so that without his favour and approbation, they cannot obtain them, there is little reason to believe that a majority will ever concur in impeaching the president, let his conduct be ever so reprehensible, especially too, as the final event of that impeachment will depend upon a different body, and the members of the house of delegates will be certain, should the decision be ultimately in favour of the president, to become thereby the objects of his displeasure, and to bar to themselves every avenue to the emoluments of government. Should he, contrary to probability, be impeached, he is afterwards to be tried and adjudged by the senate, and without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members who shall be present, he cannot be convicted—This senate being constituted a privy council to the president, it is probable many of its leading and influential members may have advised or concurred in the very measures for which he may be impeached; the members of the senate also are by the system, placed as unduly under the influence of, and dependent upon the president, as [216]the members of the other branch, since they also are appointable to offices, and cannot obtain them but through the favour of the president—There will be great, important and valuable offices under this government, should it take place, more than sufficient to enable him to hold out the expectation of one of them to each of the senators—Under these circumstances, will any person conceive it to be difficult for the president always to secure to himself more than one-third of that body? Or, can it reasonably be believed, that a criminal will be convicted who is constitutionally empowered to bribe his judges, at the head of whom is to preside on those occasions the chief justice, which officer in his original appointment, must be nominated by the president, and will therefore, probably, be appointed not so much for his eminence in legal knowledge and for his integrity, as from favouritism and influence, since the president knowing that in case of impeachment the chief justice is to preside at his trial, will naturally wish to fill that office with a person of whose voice and influence he shall consider himself secure.—These are reasons to induce a belief that there will be but little probability of the president ever being either impeached or convicted; but it was also urged, that vested with the powers which the system gives him and with the influence attendant upon those powers, to him it would be but of little consequence whether he was impeached or convicted, since he will be able to set both at defiance.—These considerations occasioned a part of the convention to give a negative to this part of the system establishing the executive as it is now offered for our acceptance.

Letter,No,Luther Martin,Thomas Cockey Deye,Maryland Gazette,,1/29/1788,"To the Honorable THOMAS COCKEY DEYE, Speaker of the House of Delegates. Sir, I flatter myself the subject of this letter will be a sufficient apology for thus publicly addressing it to you, and through you to the other members of the House of Delegates. It cannot have yet escaped your or their recollection, that when called upon as the servant of a free State to render an account of those transactions in which I had had a share in consequence of the trust reposed in me by that State, among other things, I informed them “that sometime in July, the Honorable Mr. Yates and Mr. Lansing of New-York, left the convention—that they had uniformly opposed the system, and that I believed desparing of getting a proper one brought forward, or of rendering any real service, they returned no more.”2—You cannot, Sir, have forgot, for the incident was too remarkable not to have made some impression, that upon my giving this information, the zeal of one of my honorable colleagues, in favour of a system which I thought it my duty to oppose, impelled him to interrupt me, and in a manner which I am confident his zeal alone prevented him from being convinced was not the most delicate, to insinuate pretty strongly that the statement which I had given of the conduct of those gentlemen and their motives for not returning was not candid. Those honorable members have officially given information on this subject by a joint letter to his Excellency Governor Clinton—it is published.3—Indulge me, Sir, in giving an extract from it, that it may stand contrasted in the same page with the information I gave, and may convict me of the want of candour of which I was charged, if the charge was just; if it will not do that, then let it silence my accusers. “Thus circumstanced, under these impressions, to have hesitated would have been to be culpable: We therefore gave the principles of the constitution, which has received the sanction of a majority of the convention, our decided and unreserved dissent. We were not present at the completion of the new constitution, but before we left the convention, its principles were so well established as to convince us, that no alteration was to be expected to conform it to our ideas of expediency and safety. A persuasion that our further attendance would be fruitless and unavailing rendered us less solicitous to return.”4 These, Sir, are their words.—On these I shall make no comment.—I wish not to wound the feelings of any person, I only wish to convince. I have the honor to remain, With the utmost respect, Your very obedient servant, LUTHER MARTIN. Baltimore, January 27, 1788."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/1/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, continued. By the third article, the judicial power of the United States is vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts, as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.—These courts, and these only, will have a right to decide upon the laws of the United States, and all questions arising upon their construction, and in a judicial manner to carry those laws into execution; to which the courts both superior and inferior of the respective States and their judges and other magistrates are rendered incompetent.—To the courts of the general government are also confined all cases in law or equity, arising under the proposed constitution, and treaties made under the authority of the United States—all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls—all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction—all controversies to which the United States are a party—all controversies between two or more States—between a State and citizens of another State—between citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States, and between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects.—Whether therefore, any laws or regulations of the Congress, or any acts of its president or other officers are contrary to, or not warranted by the constitution, rests only with the judges, who are appointed by Congress to determine; by whose determinations every State must be bound.—Should any question arise between a foreign consul and any of the citizens of the United States, however remote from the seat of empire, it is to be heard before the judiciary of the general government, and in the first instance to be heard in the supreme court, however inconvenient to the parties, and however trifling the subject of dispute. Should the mariners of an American or foreign vessel, while in any American port, have occasion to sue for their wages, or in any other instance a controversy belonging to the admiralty jurisdiction should take place between them and their masters or owners, it is in the courts of the general government the suit must be instituted—and either party may carry it by appeal to its supreme court—the injury to commerce and the oppression to individuals which may thence arise need not be enlarged upon.—Should a citizen of Virginia, Pennsylvania, or any other of the United States be indebted to, or have debts due from, a citizen of this State, or any other claim be subsisting on one side or the other, in consequence of commercial or other transactions, it is only in the courts of Congress that either can apply for redress. The [268]case is the same should any claims subsist between citizens of this State and foreigners, merchants, mariners and others, whether of a commercial or of any other nature, they must be prosecuted in the same courts; and though in the first instance they may be brought in the inferior, yet an appeal may be made to the supreme judiciary, even from the remotest State in the union. The inquiry concerning, and trial of every offence against, and breach of the laws of Congress are also confined to its courts—the same courts also have the sole right to inquire concerning and try every offence, from the lowest to the highest, committed by the citizens of any other State, or of a foreign nation, against the laws of this State within its territory—and in all these cases the decision may be ultimately brought before the supreme tribunal, since the appellate jurisdiction extends to criminal as well as to civil cases. And in all those cases where the general government has jurisdiction in civil questions, the proposed constitution not only makes no provision for the trial by jury in the first instance, but by its appellate jurisdiction absolutely takes away that inestimable priviledge, since it expressly declares the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact.—Should, therefore, a jury be adopted in the inferior court, it would only be a needless expence, since on an appeal the determination of that jury even on questions of fact, however honest and upright, is to be of no possible effect—the supreme court is to take up all questions of fact—to examine the evidence relative thereto—to decide upon them in the same manner as if they had never been tried by a jury—Nor is trial by jury secured in criminal cases; it is true, that in the first instance, in the inferior court the trial is to be by jury, in this and in this only, is the difference between criminal and civil cases; but, Sir, the appellate jurisdiction extends, as I have observed, to cases criminal as well as to civil, and on the appeal the court is to decide not only on the law but on the fact, if, therefore, even in criminal cases the general government is not satisfied with the verdict of the jury, its officer may remove the prosecution to the supreme court, and there the verdict of the jury is to be of no effect, but the judges of this court are to decide upon the fact as well as the law, the same as in civil cases. Thus, Sir, jury trials, which have ever been the boast of the English constitution, which have been by our several State constitutions so cautiously secured to us,—jury trials which have so long been considered the surest barrier against arbitrary power, and the palladium of liberty,—with the loss of which the loss of our freedom may be dated, are taken away by the proposed form of government, not only in a great variety of questions between individual and individual, but in every case whether civil or criminal arising under the laws of the United States or the execution of those [269]laws.—It is taken away in those very cases where of all others it is most essential for our liberty, to have it sacredly guarded and preserved—in every case whether civil or criminal, between government and its officers on the one part and the subject or citizen on the other.—Nor was this the effect of inattention, nor did it arise from any real difficulty in establishing and securing jury trials by the proposed constitution, if the convention had wished so to do—But the same reason influenced here as in the case of the establishment of inferior courts;—as they could not trust State judges, so would they not confide in State juries.—They alledged that the general government and the State governments would always be at variance—that the citizens of the different States would enter into the views and interests of their respective States, and therefore ought not to be trusted in determining causes in which the general government was any way interested, without giving the general government an opportunity, if it disapproved the verdict of the jury, to appeal, and to have the facts examined into again and decided upon by its own judges, on whom it was thought a reliance might be had by the general government, they being appointed under its authority. Thus, Sir, in consequence of this appellate jurisdiction and its extension to facts as well as to law, every arbitrary act of the general government, and every oppression of all those variety of officers appointed under its authority for the collection of taxes, duties, impost, excise, and other purposes, must be submitted to by the individual, or must be opposed with little prospect of success and almost a certain prospect of ruin, at least in those cases where the middle and common class of citizens are interested—Since to avoid that oppression, or to obtain redress, the application must be made to one of the courts of the United States—by good fortune should this application be in the first instance attended with success, and should damages be recovered equivalent to the injury sustained, an appeal lies to the supreme court, in which case the citizen must at once give up his cause, or he must attend to it at the distance of perhaps more than a thousand miles from the place of his residence, and must take measures to procure before that court on the appeal all the evidence necessary to support his action, which even if ultimately prosperous must be attended with a loss of time, a neglect of business, and an expence which will be greater than the original grievance, and to which men in moderate circumstances would be utterly unequal. By the third section of this article it is declared that treason against the United States, shall consist in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid or comfort. By the principles of the American revolution, arbitrary power may and ought to be resisted even by arms if necessary—The time may come when it shall be the duty of a State, in order to preserve itself from the [270]oppression of the general government, to have recourse to the sword—In which case the proposed form of government declares that the State and every of its citizens who act under its authority are guilty of a direct act of treason—reducing by this provision the different States to this alternative that they must tamely and passively yield to despotism or their citizens must oppose it at the hazard of the halter if unsuccessful—and reducing the citizens of the State which shall take arms to a situation in which they must be exposed to punishment, let them act as they will, since if they obey the authority of their State government, they will be guilty of treason against the United States—if they join the general government they will be guilty of treason against their own State. To save the citizens of the respective States from this disagreeable dilemma, and to secure them from being punishable as traitors to the United States when acting expressly in obedience to the authority of their own State, I wished to have obtained as an amendment to the third section of this article the following clause: “Provided that no act or acts done by one or more of the States against the United States, or by any citizen of any one of the United States under the authority of one or more of the said States, shall be deemed treason or punished as such; but in case of war being levied by one or more of the States against the United States the conduct of each party towards the other, and their adherents respectively, shall be regulated by the laws of war and of nations.”2 But this provision was not adopted, being too much opposed to the great object of many of the leading members of the convention, which was by all means to leave the States at the mercy of the general government, since they could not succeed in their immediate and entire abolition. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/5/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to The House of Assembly, continued. By the third section of the fourth article, no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State, without the consent of the legislature of such State. There are a number of States which are so circumstanced with respect to themselves and to the other States, that every principle of justice and sound policy, require their dismemberment or division into smaller States.—Massachusetts is divided into two districts, totally separated from each other by the State of New-Hampshire,—on the northeast side of which lies the provinces of Main and Sagadohock, more extensive in point of territory, but less populous than old Massachusetts, which lies on the other side of New-Hampshire.—No person can cast their eye on the map of that State but they must in a moment admit, that every argument drawn from convenience, interest, and justice require that the provinces of Main and Sagadohock should be erected into a new State, and that they should not be compelled to remain connected with old Massachusetts under all the inconveniences of their situation. The State of Georgia is larger in extent than the whole island of Great-Britain, extending from its sea coast to the Missisippi, a distance of eight hundred miles or more; its breadth for the most part, about three hundred miles.—The States of North-Carolina and Virginia in the same manner reach from the sea coast unto the Missisippi. The hardship, the inconvenience, and the injustice of compelling the inhabitants of those States who may dwell on the western side of the mountains and along the Ohio and Missisippi rivers to remain connected with the inhabitants of those States respectively, on the atlantic side of the mountains, and subject to the same State governments, would be such as would in my opinion, justify even recourse to arms to free themselves from and to shake off so ignominious a yoke. This representation was made in convention, and it was further urged that the territory of these States were too large, and that the inhabitants thereof would be too much disconnected for a republican government to extend to them its benefits, which is only suited to a small and compact territory—That a regard also for the peace and safety of the union, ought to excite a desire that those States should become in time divided into separate States, since when their population should become proportioned in any degree to their territory, they would from their strength [282]and power become dangerous members of a federal government.—It was further said that if the general government was not by its constitution to interfere, the inconvenience would soon remedy itself, for that as the population increased in those States, their legislatures would be obliged to consent to the erection of new States to avoid the evils of a civil war, but as by the proposed constitution the general government is obliged to protect each State against domestic violence, and consequently will be obliged to assist in suppressing such commotions and insurrections as may take place from the struggle to have new States erected, the general government ought to have a power to decide upon the propriety and necessity of establishing or erecting a new State even without the approbation of the legislature of such States, within whose jurisdiction the new State should be erected, and for this purpose I submitted to the convention the following proposition—“That on the application of the inhabitants of any district of territory within the limits of any of the States, it shall be lawful for the legislature of the United States, if they shall under all circumstances think it reasonable, to erect the same into a new State, and admit it into the union without the consent of the State of which the said district may be a part.”2 And it was said that we surely might trust the general government with this power with more propriety than with many others with which they were proposed to be entrusted—and that as the general government was bound to suppress all insurrections and commotions which might arise on this subject, it ought to be in the power of the general government to decide upon it, and not in the power of the legislature of a single State by obstinately and unreasonably opposing the erection of a new State to prevent its taking effect, and thereby extremely to oppress that part of its citizens which live remote from, and inconvenient to, the seat of its government, and even to involve the union in war to support its injustice and oppression.—But, upon the vote being taken, Georgia, South-Carolina, North-Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, were in the negative.—New-Hampshire, Connecticut, Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, were in the affirmative.—New York was absent.3 That it was inconsistent with the rights of free and independent States, to have their territory dismembered without their consent, was the principal argument used by the opponents of this proposition.—The truth of the objection we readily admitted, but at the same time, insisted that it was not more inconsistent with the rights of free and independent States than that inequality of suffrage and power which the large States had extorted from the others; and that if the smaller States yielded up their rights in that instance, they were entitled to demand from the States of extensive territory a surrender of their rights in this instance; and in [283]a particular manner, as it was equally necessary for the true interest and happiness of the citizens of their own States, as of the union.—But, Sir, although when the large States demanded undue and improper sacrifices to be made to their pride and ambition, they treated the rights of free States with more contempt than ever a British parliament treated the rights of her colonial establishments, yet when a reasonable and necessary sacrifice was asked from them they spurned the idea with ineffable disdain. They then perfectly understood the full value and the sacred obligation of State rights, and at the least attempt to infringe them where they were concerned, they were tremblingly alive and agonized at every pore. When we reflect how obstinately those States contended for that unjust superiority of power in the government, which they have in part obtained, and for the establishment of this superiority by the constitution.—When we reflect that they appeared willing to hazard the existence of the union rather than not to succeed in their unjust attempt—That should their legislatures consent to the erection of new States within their jurisdiction, it would be an immediate sacrifice of that power, to obtain which they appeared disposed to sacrifice every other consideration. When we further reflect that they now have a motive for desiring to preserve their territory entire and unbroken, which they never had before—the gratification of their ambition in possessing and exercising superior power over their sister States—and that this constitution is to give them the means to effect this desire of which they were formerly destitute—the whole force of the United States pledged to them for restraining intestine commotions, and preserving to them the obedience and subjection of their citizens, even in the extremest part of their territory;—I say, Sir, when we consider these things it would be too absurd and improbable to deserve a serious answer, should any person suggest that these States mean ever to give their consent to the erection of new States within their territory.—Some of them it is true, have been for some time past amusing their inhabitants in those districts that wished to be erected into new States, but should this constitution be adopted, armed with a sword and halter to compel their obedience and subjection, they will no longer act with indecision;—and the State of Maryland may, and probably will be called upon to assist with her wealth and her blood in subduing the inhabitants of Franklin, Kentucky, Vermont, and the provinces of Main and Sagadohock, and in compelling them to continue in subjection to the States which respectively claim jurisdiction over them. Let it not be forgotten at the same time, that a great part of the territory of these large and extensive States, which they now hold in possession, and over which they now claim and exercise jurisdiction, [284]were crown lands, unlocated and unsettled when the American revolution took place—Lands which were acquired by the common blood and treasure, and which ought to have been the common stock, and for the common benefit of the Union.—Let it be remembered that the State of Maryland was so deeply sensible of the injustice that these lands should be held by particular States for their own emolument, even at a time when no superiority of authority or power was annexed to extensive territory, that in the midst of the late war and all the dangers which threatened us, it withheld for a long time its assent to the articles of confederation for that reason, and when it ratified those articles it entered a solemn protest against what it considered so flagrant injustice;4—But, Sir, the question is not now whether those States shall hold that territory unjustly to themselves, but whether by that act of injustice they shall have superiority of power and influence over the other States, and have a constitutional right to domineer and lord it over them—Nay, more, whether we will agree to a form of government by which we pledge to those States the whole force of the union to preserve to them that extensive territory entire and unbroken, and with our blood and wealth to assist them, whenever they please to demand it, to preserve the inhabitants thereof under their subjection, for the purpose of increasing their superiority over us—of gratifying their unjust ambition—in a word, for the purpose of giving ourselves masters, and of rivetting our chains! (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Gazette,,2/8/1788,"Mr. Martin’s Information to the House of Assembly, concluded. The part of the system, which provides that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States, was adopted by a very great majority of the convention, and without much debate,2—however, there were some members so unfashionable as to think that a belief of the existence of a Deity, and of a state of future rewards and punishments would be some security for the good conduct of our rulers, and that in a Christian country it would be at least decent to hold out some distinction between the professors of Christianity and downright infidelity or paganism. The seventh article declares, that the ratification of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the States ratifying the same. It was attempted to obtain a resolve that if seven States, whose votes in the first branch should amount to a majority of the representation [286]in that branch, concured in the adoption of the system, it should be sufficient, and this attempt was supported on the principle, that a majority ought to govern the minority;3—but to this it was objected that although it was true, after a constitution and form of government is agreed on, in every act done under and consistent with that constitution and form of government, the act of the majority, unless otherwise agreed in the constitution, should bind the minority, yet it was directly the reverse in originally forming a constitution, or dissolving it—That in originally forming a constitution, it was necessary that every individual should agree to it to become bound thereby—and that when once adopted it could not be dissolved by consent, unless with the consent of every individual who was party to the original agreement—That in forming our original federal government every member of that government, that is each State, expressly consented to it;—that it is a part of the compact made and entered into in the most solemn manner, that there should be no dissolution or alteration of that federal government without the consent of every State, the members of, and parties to the original compact; that therefore no alteration could be made by the consent of a part of the States, or by the consent of the inhabitants of a part of the States, which could either release the States so consenting from the obligation they are under to the other States, or which could in any manner become obligatory upon those States that should not ratify such alterations.—Satisfied of the truth of these positions, and not holding ourselves at liberty to violate the compact, which this State had solemnly entered into with the others, by altering it in a different manner from that which by the same compact is provided and stipulated, a number of the members and among those the delegation of this State opposed the ratification of this system in any other manner than by the unanimous consent and agreement of all the States. By our original articles of confederation any alterations proposed are in the first place to be approved by Congress.—Accordingly as the resolutions were originally adopted by the convention, and as they were reported by the committee of detail, it was proposed that this system should be laid before Congress for their approbation;—but, Sir, the warm advocates of this system fearing it would not meet with the approbation of Congress, and determined, even though Congress and the respective State legislatures should disapprove the same, to force it upon them, if possible, through the intervention of the people at large moved to strike out the words “for their approbation” and succeeded in their motion; to which, it being directly in violation of the mode prescribed by the articles of confederation for the alteration of our federal government, a part of the convention, and myself in the number, thought it a duty to give a decided negative.4 Agreeable to the articles of confederation entered into in the most solemn manner, and for the observance of which the States pledged themselves to each other, and called upon the Supreme Being as a witness and avenger between them, no alterations are to be made in those articles unless after they are approved by Congress, they are agreed to and ratified by the legislature of every State; but by the resolve of the convention this constitution is not to be ratified by the legislatures of the respective States, but is to be submitted to conventions chosen by the people, and if ratified by them is to be binding. This resolve was opposed among others by the delegation of Maryland;—your delegates were of opinion that as the form of government proposed was, if adopted, most essentially to alter the constitution of this State, and as our constitution had pointed out a mode by which, and by which only, alterations were to be made therein,5 a convention of the people could not be called to agree to and ratify the said form of government without a direct violation of our constitution, which it is the duty of every individual in this State to protect and support;—in this opinion all your delegates who were attending were unanimous—I, Sir, opposed it also upon a more extensive ground—as being directly contrary to the mode of altering our federal government established in our original compact, and as such being a direct violation of the mutual faith plighted by the States to each other, I gave it my negative.6 I also was of opinion that the States considered as States, in their political capacity, are the members of a federal government—That the States in their political capacity, or as sovereignties, are entitled, and only entitled originally to agree upon the form of, and submit themselves to, a federal government, and afterwards by mutual consent to dissolve or to alter it—That every thing which relates to the formation, the dissolution or the alteration of a federal government over States equally free, sovereign and independent is the peculiar province of the States in their sovereign or political capacity, in the same manner as what relates to forming alliances or treaties of peace, amity or commerce, and that the people at large in their individual capacity, have no more right to interfere in the one case than in the other—That according to these principles we originally acted in forming our confederation; it was the States as States, by their representatives in Congress, that formed the articles of confederation;—it was the States as States, by their legislatures, ratified those articles, and it was there established and provided that the States as States, that as by their legislatures, should agree to any alterations that should hereafter be proposed in the federal government, before they should be binding—and any alterations agreed to in any other manner cannot release the States from the obligation [288]they are under to each other by virtue of the original articles of confederation.—The people of the different States never made any objection to the manner the articles of confederation were formed or ratified, or to the mode by which alterations were to be made in that government—with the rights of their respective States they wished not to interfere—Nor do I believe the people in their individual capacity would ever have expected or desired to have been appealed to on the present occasion, in violation of the rights of their respective States, if the favourers of the proposed constitution, imagining they had a better chance of forcing it to be adopted by a hasty appeal to the people at large, who could not be so good judges of the dangerous consequences, had not insisted upon this mode—Nor do these positions in the least interfere with the principle, that all power originates from the people, because when once the people have exercised their power in establishing and forming themselves into a State government, it never devolves back to them, nor have they a right to resume or again to exercise that power until such events take place as will amount to a dissolution of their State government:—And it is an established principle that a dissolution or alteration of a federal government doth not dissolve the State governments which compose it.—It was also my opinion that upon principles of sound policy, the agreement or disagreement to the proposed system ought to have been by the State legislatures, in which case, let the event have been what it would, there would have been but little prospect of the public peace being disturbed thereby—Whereas the attempt to force down this system, although Congress and the respective State legislatures should disapprove, by appealing to the people, and to procure its establishment in a manner totally unconstitutional, has a tendency to set the State governments and their subjects at variance with each other—to lessen the obligations of government—to weaken the bands of society—to introduce anarchy and confusion—and to light the torch of discord and civil war throughout this continent.—All these considerations weighed with me most forcibly against giving my assent to the mode by which it is resolved this system is to be ratified, and were urged by me in opposition to the measure.7 I have now, Sir, in discharge of the duty I owe to this house, given such information as hath occured to me, which I consider most material for them to know; and you will easily perceive from this detail that a great portion of that time, which ought to have been devoted calmly and impartially to consider what alterations in our federal government would be most likely to procure and preserve the happiness of the union, was employed in a violent struggle on the one side to obtain all power and dominion in their own hands, and on the other to prevent [289]it—and that the aggrandizement of particular States and particular individuals appears to have been much more the object sought after than the welfare of our country. The interest of this State, not confined merely to itself, abstracted from all others, but considered relatively; and as far as was consistent with the common interest of the other States, I thought it my duty to pursue according to the best opinion I could form of it. When I took my seat in the convention, I found them attempting to bring forward a system, which I was sure never had entered into the contemplation of those I had the honour to represent, and which upon the fullest consideration, I considered not only injurious to the interest and the rights of this State, but also incompatible with the political happiness and freedom of the States in general; from that time until my business compelled me to leave the convention, I gave it every possible opposition in every stage of its progression.—I opposed the system there with the same explicit frankness with which I have here given you a history of our proceedings, and an account of my own conduct, which in a particular manner I consider you as having a right to know—While there, I endeavoured to act as became a free man, and the delegate of a free State. Should my conduct obtain the approbation of those who appointed me, I will not deny it would afford me satisfaction; but to me that approbation was at most no more than a secondary consideration—my first was to deserve it;—left to myself to act according to the best of my discretion, my conduct should have been the same, had I been even sure your censure would have been my only reward, since I hold it sacredly my duty to dash the cup of poison, if possible, from the hand of a State or an individual, however anxious the one or the other might be to swallow it. Indulge me, Sir, in a single observation further. There are persons who endeavour to hold up the idea that this system is only opposed by the officers of government—I, Sir, am in that predicament.—I have the honor to hold an appointment in this State.8 Had it been considered any objection, I presume I should not have been appointed to the convention—If it could have any effect on my mind, it would only be that of warming my heart with gratitude, and rendering me more anxious to promote the true interest of that State which has conferred upon me the obligation, and to heighten my guilt had I joined in sacrificing its essential rights—But, Sir, it would be well to remember, that this system is not calculated to diminish the number or the value of offices—on the contrary, if adopted, it will be productive of an enormous increase in their number—many of them will be also of great honour and emolument. Whether, Sir, in this variety of appointments and in [290]the scramble for them, I might not have as good a prospect to advantage myself as many others is not for me to say—but this, Sir, I can say with truth, that so far was I from being influenced in my conduct by interest, or the consideration of office, that I would cheerfully resign the appointment I now hold—I would bind myself never to accept another either under the general government or that of my own State—I would do more, Sir, so destructive do I consider the present system to the happiness of my country, I would cheerfully sacrifice that share of property with which Heaven has blessed a life of industry,—I would reduce myself to indigence and poverty; and those who are dearer to me than my own existence I would entrust to the care and protection of that Providence who hath so kindly protected myself, if on those terms only I could procure my country to reject those chains which are forged for it."
Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/8/1788,"Extract of a letter from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to a gentleman in this city, dated Jan. 29, 1788. “We are all in an uproar in Maryland; the federal agents, have taken the alarm, since the substance of the honorable Mr. Martin’s examination before the Assembly, appeared in Mr. Hayes’s papers.2 This gentleman at the instance of a great number of his constituents, was called upon to declare his objections in the public prints, to the new federal government, in order to enable them to form some opinion of the merits or demerits, ascribed to it, as well by its numerous advocates, as opposers. I should be glad to have your ideas, whether Mr. Martin, as one of the delegates to the late Convention, had acted a becoming part, by complying with the requisition of his constituents, and that in a matter of such infinite importance to the present, if not to future generations. If Mr. Martin refused the reiterated applications made to him on this occasion, they might naturally suppose that his objections were ill grounded and futile; or otherwise, that he sacrificed the public welfare to some private and interested considerations, highly incompatible with the dignity of a delegate to the honorable General Convention of the United States. The federal hacks here say, that he was not justifiable in holding any opinion that militated against their measures; because influence and the power of making proselytes is on their side; ergo, right or wrong, the current of faction must bear down all that comes before it; and a fig for the feeble efforts of the low born peasantry, who ought not to be allowed even the privilege of a groan, whilst they wear the galling fetters of the great, unless in the silent and solitary shade of wretchedness, and obscurity. [“]The federal hacks assert, that whoever dares to utter a syllable in disapprobation of their cause, is from that instant, to be publicly charged as inimical to his country; and as they have the advantage of every press, from New Hampshire, to Georgia, to circulate their calumnies, the unfortunate objects of their rancour, in that extent of country, can only resort to two or three,3 at most, who have spirit and independence enough to publish in vindication of these devoted victims to power and tyranny. This circumstance accounts fully for the unanimity that prevails throughout the whole continent, in adopting [292]the new federal government, for wherever there is a printing press, there you will find some federal hacks, or company of hacks, who claim an absolute dominion over Mr. Type, as if unlimited monarchy had already been established in this wretched country. The Post-Offices4 are also under the influence of these sons of power, so much so that a paper printed at New-York cannot find its way to Philadelphia, Baltimore, or any of the other states; neither can the papers of the Southward proceed an inch farther than the office they are put in at, unless they should happen to contain the most fulsome elogiums, on Franky’s New Roof,5 which is to accommodate him and all the Office-hunters on the continent. The minority whom I shall call every man in the community, from whom a fair, open and candid enquiry is withheld, either by direct or indirect means, and who have no views of lucrative offices under the federal government; I say, sir, that the minority, these real disinterested patriots should assiduously exhort each other, to exert every nerve for the good of their country and posterity; and not suffer one tenth part of their fellow subjects, with the help of their expecting, gaping minions, to enslave all the rest. But these salutary admonitions, I fear, cannot impede the evil in its rapid progress, unless the federal bandage can be removed from the people’s eyes. For it is the peculiar property of the bandage to keep every thing from their sight, which would enable them to judge for themselves, especially at this critical important juncture. [“]It is plain to see, that those who have had the art to blindfold them, will have the constitutional legal privilege of judging for them forever after, with respect to life, liberty and property: These being trifling matters not worthy the people’s consideration, and of course, not fit to be entrusted to them, who neither know their value, nor use. When these rights and privileges get into other hands, their meaning will be fully explained, not by precept, but most assuredly by woeful example; and those who helped to cut the rod, should never in prudence or justice, complain of the smart it may create.”"

Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,Aristides,2/15/1788,"When men, to whom the guardianship of public liberty has been committed, discover a neglect if not contempt for a bill of rights—when they answer reasons by alledging a fact,—which fact too, is no fact at all—it becomes a duty to bear testimony against such conduct, for silence and acquiescence in political language are synonimous terms. If men were as anxious about reality as appearance, we should have fewer professions of disinterested patriotism—true patriotism like true piety, is incompatible with an ostentatious personal display. In a world more cautious than correct, the intrusion of private names in a public cause, is generally considered as a sacrifice of prudence to vanity, and not unfrequently censured as impertinent—in either view it is unreasonable to require it—It is more, it is inadmissable—it would be betraying one of those inestimable rights of an individual, over which society should have no controul—the freedom of the press—and the only recompence for the treason, would be a boundless increase of private malice.1 That men who profess an attachment to the liberty of the press, should also require names, is one of those instances of human weakness and inconsistency, that deserves rather pity than resentment. Political as well as religious freedom has ever been and forever will be destroyed by that invariable tendency of enthusiasts and bigots to mark out as objects of public resentment and persecution, those who presume to dispute their opinions or question their infallibility—and whilst there are men, enthusiasm and bigotry will prevail—it is the natural predominance of the passions over reason—The citizens of America are not yet so agitated by the phrenzy of innovation as to forget—that the object of public inquiry is, or ought to be, truth—that to convert truth into falsehood, right into wrong, is equally beyond the reach of the good, the bad, the great and the humble—A great name may indeed impose falsehood for truth—wrong for right—and whenever such voluntarily offer themselves, there may be ground for suspicion—But the people may [309]listen with safety to those, who assert no other claim to their attention, than the reason and merit of their remarks. To assert that bills of rights have always originated from, or been considered as grants of the King or Prince, and that the liberties which they secure are the gracious concessions of the sovereign, betrays an equal ignorance of history and of law, or what in effect amounts to the same thing a violent and precipitate zeal.2 I believe no writer in the most venal age, has ever openly asserted this doctrine, but the prostituted, rotten Sir Robert Filmer,3 and Aristides—And the man who at this day would contend in England that their bill of rights is the grant of the King, would find the general contempt his only security—in saying this, I sincerely regret that the name of Aristides should be joined with that of Sir Robert Filmer, and I freely acknowledge that no contemptible degree of talents, and integrity render him who uses it, much more worthy of the very respectable association he has selected for himself—But the errors of such men alone are dangerous—the man who has too much activity of mind, or restlessness to be quiet, qualities to engage public and private esteem, talents to form and support an opinion, fortitude to avow it, and too much pride to be convinced, will at all times have weight in a free country, (especially where indolence is the general characteristic) though that weight he will always find impaired in proportion as he indulges levity, caprice and passion. I will confine my inquiry to the English constitution—Example there, is in a great measure law here—and the authority of an American judge on a point of English law, should be digested with coolness and promulgated with caution, because it is frequently conclusory. The celebrated and only bill of rights of Great-Britain, which is considered as the supreme law of the land, and not to be questioned or impeached in their courts, was the work of that convention of lords and commons in 1688, which declared that King James 2d, had abdicated the crown, and that the throne had thereby become vacant, and who after they had compleated and asserted this glorious declaration of the unalienable rights of their fellow citizens, pursuing the peculiar duty of a convention, conferred the crown of the three kingdoms on an alien and foreigner, William the 3d. Can any man imagine that this convention could at that time, have considered these rights as the grant of a King, whom they previously declared to have abdicated the throne, or the gracious concessions of a Prince whom they were about to deprive forever of the crown? Or could they have considered this bill of rights as the concession of Prince William, at that time a foreigner and alien, not entitled to hold a foot [310]of land, or any of the common rights of citizenship, and who could afterwards only derive his title to the crown from the same source, which gave authority and sanction to this fundamental and most inestimable law? or, could the British nation at that time, or ever since, have viewed this declaration, as the grant and concession of a King or Prince, when no King or Prince was at that time in existence?—But should there remain any minds yet unsatisfied, I refer such to the debates of that convention, which are preserved in Grey’s debates in parliament,4 and there will be found in them, the principles of equal liberty, the inherent and unalienable rights of men, as amply and ably discussed, and as fully recognized by the authors of that blessing, the artists of that British palladium, as ever they have since been by the animated patriots of America, or the present age.—I also refer them to an inestimable little treatise composed on this occasion by that accomplished lawyer and patriot, afterwards the Lord Somers—High Chancellor of Great-Britain—then a member of the convention, and chiefly instrumental in their great work—a pamphlet that should find a place in the library of every American judge at least5—Whoever peruses these, will discover undeniable evidence, that the British convention, considered this their declaration, as the concession of no Prince, but the Prince of Heaven—whom alone they acknowledged as the author of their liberties—they will there find that a bill of rights, is an enumeration of those conditions on which the individuals of the empire agreed to confirm the social compact; and consequently that no power, which they thus conditionally delegated to the majority (in whatever form organized) should be so exercised as to infringe and impair these their natural rights—not vested in society, but reserved to each member thereof. This was not the doctrine of that period alone—It was the common law and constitution of England, so asserted and maintained by the ablest lawyers of every age of the empire.—The petition of right, which came forward in the reign of Charles 1st, said to have been originally penned by the celebrated Lord Coke6—although in its title a contradiction in terms, is yet in substance equally strong and clear—asserting the rights of the people to be coeval with the government—We find this principle strenuously and ably maintained through all the works of this great man, and to this doctrine he finally, with the devotion of a freeman, and the fortitude of an Englishman, sacrificed his vanity, his ambition and his avarice—This last act of an aged and venerable judge, has obliterated the errors of a youthful courtier—it has made his peace with posterity, who with gratitude and indulgence has forgiven the conduct of a court lawyer, which she might have punished with detestation, although she could not correct. Here I cannot but observe what strenuous bill of rights men, all the great luminaries of the English law have been: to Lord Coke and Lord Somers, I will add that [– – –] of human nature, Sir Matthew Hale,7 in whom were united true Christian piety, Roman fortitude, and an understanding more than human. This perfect man although firmly opposed to the violences of the mad fanatics of the age, stood up almost alone in that parliament which restored the regal government, in favor of a bill of rights—but the tide of popular rage, hastening to place the worthless Charles on the throne of his more worthless ancestors, was too strong, and the voice of that man could not be heard, who was the delight of his own and the admiration of succeeding ages. It is true, that something like the doctrine of Aristides was frequently the language of courtiers and sycophants in the feeble reigns of the arbitrary Stuarts—times of impotent and impudent usurpation—and they grounded their assertions on the form of the statute of magna charta, a statute much esteemed for the many valuable rights it ascertains—the enacting words of which imply it to be an act of the King—But Aristides must know that this was the frequent form of the ancient statutes, sometime it is the King alone enacts, sometime the King with advice and consent of the great men and Barons, and sometimes the three estates—Even at this day, the King uses these words in passing laws that bear the same implication; and we see even in America acts of authority issue under the name and signature of the Governor alone, who has not a voice unless the council are divided—But as to the legal and acknowledged authority of the King at the time of enacting magna charta, there can remain but little doubt. Henry Bracton8 a cotemporary lawyer and judge, who has left us a compleat and able treatise on the laws of England, is thus clear and express—Omnes quidem sub rege, ipse autem sub lege, all are subject to the King, but the King is subject to the law—It will hardly then be imagined, that the supreme law and constitution were the grants and concessions of a Prince, who was thus in theory and practice, subject himself to ordinary acts of legislation—But all these things are so amply discussed and the authorities so accurately collected in the publication of my Lord Somers, that a reference must be much more satisfactory than a repetition. If I understand Aristides, he says that it would have been considered as an arrogant usurpation of sovereign rights in the members of convention, to have affixed a bill of rights—Can he reconcile this position with another opinion in his remarks, where he maintains that in offering this constitution, they could only act as private individuals, any of whom have a right to propose a constitution to the Americans to adopt at their discretion—In this view they could only have proposed—it is [312]certain they could not have enacted a bill of rights—Nor would there have been any usurpation in We the people, of the States of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, &c. securing to ourselves and our posterity the following unalienable rights, &c. which is the stile of the new constitution—The convention have actually engrafted some of these natural rights, yet no one calls it an usurpation—nor can I believe that any of my fellow-citizens of the United States, would have discovered the least indignation, had they engrafted them all—The universal complaint has been that they have enumerated so few—But says Aristides, it would have been a work of great difficulty, if not impossible to have ascertained them—Are the fundamental rights of mankind at this day unknown? Are they so soon forgot? If they are not imprinted on our hearts, they are in several of the constitutions—Although various in form, they are certainly not contradictory in substance—It did not require the wisdom of a national convention to have reduced them into order, and such as would not have gained the suffrage of a majority, would never have been regretted by America—or, I will venture to assert, what I shall never believe, that the majority were very unworthy of the trust reposed in them—Nor yet can I believe, that the late convention were incompetent to a task that has never been undertaken in the separate States without success. This constitution is to be the act of the individual members of the American empire—the highest source of terrestial power with us—As it is a subsequent act, it not only repeals all prior acts of the same authority where it interferes with them—But being a government of the people of all the States, I do not know what right the citizens of Maryland for instance, have to expect that the citizens of Connecticut or New-Jersey, will be governed by the laws or constitution of Maryland—or what benefit a citizen of Maryland could derive from his bill of rights in a court of the United States, which can only be governed by the constitution and laws of the United States—Nor will it help the question to say, what will certainly be denied, that the future Congress may provide by law for this,—that an ordinary law of the United States can make, is an admission that it can unmake, and to submit the bills of rights of the separate State to the power of every annual national parliament, is a very uncertain tenure indeed. If a citizen of Maryland can have no benefit of his own bill of rights in the confederal courts, and there is no bill of rights of the United States—how could he take advantage of a natural right founded in reason, could he plead it and produce Locke, Sydney, or Montesquieu as authority? How could he take advantage of any of the common law rights, which have heretofore been considered as the birthright of Englishmen and their descendants, could he plead them and produce the authority of the English judges in his support? Unquestionably not, for [313]the authority of the common law arises from the express adoption by the several States in their respective constitutions, and that in various degrees and under different modifications—If admitted at all, I do not see to what extent, and if admitted, it must be admitted as unalterable by ordinary acts of legislation, which would be impossible—and it could never be of use to an individual, but in combating some national law infringing natural right.—To render this more intelligible—suppose for instance, that an officer of the United States should force the house, the asylum of a citizen, by virtue of a general warrant, I would ask, are general warrants illegal by the constitution of the United States?9 Would a court, or even a jury, but juries are no longer to exist, punish a man who acted by express authority, upon the bare recollection of what once was law and right? I fear not, especially in those cases which may strongly interest the passions of government, and in such only have general warrants been used—Suppose a case that must and will frequently happen, for such happen almost daily in England—That an officer of the customs should break open the dwelling, and violate the sanctuary of a freeman, in search for smuggled goods—impost and revenue laws always are and from necessity must be in their nature oppressive—in their execution they may and will become intolerable to a free people, no remedy has been yet found equal to the task of detering and curbing the insolence of office, but a jury—It has become an invariable maxim of English juries, to give ruinous damages whenever an officer has deviated from the rigid letter of the law, or been guilty of any unnecessary act of insolence or oppression—It is true these damages to the individual, are frequently paid by government, upon a certificate of the judge that there was probable cause of suspicion—But the same reasons that would induce an English judge to give this certificate, would probably lead an American judge, who will be judge and jury too, to spare the public purse, if not favour a brother officer. I could proceed with an enumeration of familiar instances that must and will happen, that would be as alarming as prolix: but it is not my intention to ring an alarm bell—If I know myself I would rather conciliate than divide—But says Aristides the government may establish rules for such causes though not commanded; what they will do I will not presume to say; but I can readily and will hereafter prove10 that if they do, they will violate the constitution; and even admitting their power, it would be but a slender thread to hang so great a stake upon. Here I must meet a position that has been ingeniously advanced—That all powers and rights not expressly given, are consequently reserved—If this is not downright political nonsense, it is at least, untrue in theory and impossible in practice—until man is gifted with one of [314]the most important attributes of the Deity—that of foreknowledge and prophecy—it will be impossible to limit affirmatively legislative power—When a people part with the legislative power to government, they can no more say, you shall make such and such laws, than they can say, such and such events shall happen—laws must be regulated by events—All the precaution that is left to human wisdom, is the exertion of a negative limitation, speaking thus in the language of a bill of rights, no event shall authorize, no plea of necessity shall justify the legislature in making a law to abolish or infringe the freedom of the press, or the liberty of conscience, &c.—And even when these bounds are expressly and clearly assigned, we have to lament that they do not always prove an effectual safeguard against the power of government; but they are the only guard, and why shall we leave our citizens totally defenseless? A gentleman in the Pennsylvania convention, of considerable reputation, said, that the form of the constitution—the organization of power, is a bill of rights—he had then a very sensible, but unformed idea floating in his imagination, he however, expressed it inaccurately, and unfortunately got on the wrong side of his own question.11 A proper organization of power would most probably prevent a violation of a bill of rights and prove the best security of political liberty. Such an organization is nothing more than a good machine, a mint or die, that will make money in its proper form, but the quantity of alloy must be regulated by law, or the people may be cheated by a debased currency—The truth is, that the rights of individuals are frequently opposed to the apparent interests of the majority—For this reason the greater the portion of political freedom in a form of government the greater the necessity of a bill of rights—When the natural rights of an individual are opposed to the decided interests or heated passions of a large majority of a democratic government; if these rights are not clearly and expressly ascertained, the individual must be lost; and for the truth of this I appeal to every man who has borne a part in the legislative councils of America. In such governments the tyranny of the legislative is most to be dreaded.—In monarchical governments, the feelings of the majority will be most frequently on the side of the individual from the general jealousy inseperably attendant on those forms of government, where the tyranny of the executive prevails. All tyranny whether exercised in the garb of a despot, or the plain coat of a quaker, is equally detestable, and should be guarded against. If a bill of rights was that essential requisite to a good constitution, why was it omitted by a convention of the ablest men in America, a large majority of whom were unquestionably well disposed? This has been a natural inquiry, and perhaps the true reason yet remains to be [315]disclosed. I have been informed that the proposed constitution was carried through it several stages, in a very inoffensive form to the last, and that it did not assume its decided features until the days before the convention rose—the changes then effected, produced much difference of opinion—created some warmth, and their patience was too much exhausted to make the necessary correspondent alterations and additions. Those facts may, I believe, be depended on, but the inference is only offered as conjecture—if true, we may attribute the omission of a bill of rights, and many other imperfections to fatigue rather than design. From the foregoing observations, many will conclude that I am the determined foe to the new constitution—I am neither its concealed or open enemy—Sorry I am to say that I cannot in its present state be its advocate or friend—That it is as far preferable to the present existing confederation (considered as a national government) as substance is preferable to form, is a truth I have as little doubt of, as of its very numerous defects.—The true and only question is, whether any national government whatever, ought to be prefered to a league or confederacy administered by a diet, or congress of diplomatic deputies—And this is a question that will continue to divide the ablest and best men in America—the misfortune is, that experience alone will decide a doubt, which perhaps no theory is competent to solve—But that the proposed confederal constitution, cannot be considered as such a diplomatic assembly must appear to all men—It is a national government, and a league between independent States compounded—One of those mixtures of heterogeneous qualities that will forever produce a neutral—a caput mortuum12—consequently the present Congress is already found to be, but the carcase of a government, and a rotten carcase too.—The momentous subject has led me farther than I intended—My remarks will discover the hurry in which they were written—Had I leisure I would censure freely those defects in the proposed system, that must be amended, for I have strong doubts whether it can be administered in its present form—In doing this I should, I am persuaded, convince the public that Aristides has generally erred and frequently mistated in his remarks—that he has done so intentionally I neither believe myself or would wish the public to believe—to err is the common portion of humanity—and to be misinformed the frequent misfortune of ARISTIDES and A FARMER."
Newspaper,No,Grateful,,Maryland Gazette,,2/15/1788,"It is well known that the celebrated Greeks and Romans tarnished their characters, and injured their country, by proving ungrateful to their most illustrious patriots, who were raised up by Providence to save them from destruction. Ridicule and scorn, indigence, distress and banishment were often their rewards, after promoting the public good by the wisest counsels, and gaining the greatest victories over formidable enemies. Some of them, irritated by ill usage, and forgetting their indispensible duty, under the worst treatment, employed their arts and arms against those States, in the defence of which they had successfully [317]exerted both. We shudder at the conduct of these republics, because it is equally base and dangerous; let us carefully guard against it—for though I do not think any of our patriots would repeat the crime of these ancients under like provocation, it would be in itself wrong, and might discourage others from taking a share in the management of national concerns. Beside, the practice of ingratitude in so young a country as ours, would argue an high degree of corruption, and occasion just fears of the most dreadful evils. I therefore express my hope, that our inhabitants will virtuously avoid the base offence, especially at this trying crisis of affairs, when an event of inexpressible magnitude trembles in suspense, and every considerate person anxiously inquires—what will it be? Like an honest man, who means well and resolves to do his duty on the occasion, I faithfully warn my countrymen of theirs—Americans attend! you are not now asked to thank the statesmen and heroes of the late glorious war—You are called upon to thank your more deserving servants, who steadily opposed the new federal government through its several stages, till it was at last compleated, and then nobly refused to betray their trust, by giving it the sanction of their names. Among these illustrious senators, one rises on the view with a superior splendor, who, like Jupiter among the Gods, has neither “similitude nor second.” Hardly necessary is it to mention his name, because every body knows, and must know, it can be none but the Honorable L. M.1 Esquire, who claims every thing a grateful nation can bestow, for his exploits in the general convention, for his speech before the house of delegates, and for what he has since published of both to give the whole union proper information, with such corrections and valuable additions, as seemed meet to his second thoughts and more ripened reflections. It is very surprising that a single individual could do so much, and afterwards comprise such a variety of great and curious matter within so narrow a compass. What astonishing talents! To him you owe the highest returns of thankfulness, for the greatest possible performances, vastly greater than those of General Washington, between whom and himself a comparison is often intimated in the course of his narrative, which always turns out in his favor. That it may appear at one glance, what sufficient reason there is for conferring on him the most conspicuous marks of gratitude, I shall briefly enumerate the principal things, which he has done. He has shewn, 1. That the proposed federal government is diseased throughout all its parts—a composition of weakness, folly, wickedness, ignorance, oppression, tyranny, inconsistency, aristocracy, oligarchy, monarchy and anarchy—that its sins of omission equal its sins of commission—that it [318]has nothing it should have, but every thing it should not have—that no one portion or particle of it, from head to foot, deserves election or adoption, but total and final reprobation. 2. That this child of iniquity and infirmity was begotten by parents the most unjust, despotic, abandoned, profligate and diabolical, the sun ever beheld, especially “the Honorable Mr. Washington and the President of Pennsylvania,”2—that in one word, the majority of the general convention were a set of horrible miscreants, whose tempers and designs fitted them only for seats in the pandemonium of infernals. 3. That he, Mr. M——, took every proper and possible step, and employed every suitable weapon to kill and destroy this abominable offspring, from the creation of its first feature, till its whole frame was compleated, and would certainly have succeeded, had not the parents saved it by the most foul and unfair means. So wickedly vigilant and active was parental affection in them, that he could not prevent or alter the formation of its smallest joint, or give it the slightest wound, behind or before. 4. That he could spy bad intentions in men, and pernicious consequences in measures, which none else could discover, by means of a gift, power, faculty or endowment, which fable has ascribed to certain people, in the north of a distant European isle. 5. That the purest patriotism sometimes warmed the minority in convention, when they thought and voted as he did, whereas in himself it was ever alive and always enlightened, particularly in those many instances, where his proposals were rejected, and his longest speeches unanswered. 6. That he would do almost as much for the public good, as the primitive Christians did for their religion—Nay, he would even lay down his life, was he not persuaded that his country would loose more by the sacrifice, than it could gain, on any supposition whatever. He is at any time ready to reduce himself to a beggarly condition, for the sake of his dear country, in which he spends a life of the strictest temperance, and to the meanest of whose citizens he would not be indebted a shilling, though he should deny himself the common necessaries of subsistance to procure it. To evince further the purity of his intentions, it needs only to be considered, that whereas under the new government, there would be an increase of lucrative and honorable offices, a man of his character and accomplishments would stand the best chance of obtaining the foremost among them, according to his own modest hint, towards the conclusion of his admirable work. This is again rendered still more [319]certain, by recollecting how many professional men of the first reputation were his competitors, at the particular time of his appointment to the office he now fills, with so much credit to himself, so remarkably to the satisfaction of the government, and so acceptably to the whole people of the State. With so many advantages, there is no station too high for him to expect, but a tender conscience will never permit him to accept any, that might injure America in general, or Maryland in particular, whatever are or may be its emoluments. Such eminent virtues and services, merit distinguished returns—At some future period they will be made on durable materials, by the sculptor’s art, when superb pillars shall rise to eternise his exalted fame. In the mean time, and as a small immediate acknowledgment, I humbly propose that, when the electors meet to chuse delegates to the convention in April, there be circulated among them for signing, 1. An address to the Honorable L. M——. Esq. recognising his services and thanking him for the same in glowing terms. 2. Instructions, ordering the delegates to procure for him the thanks of the convention, and to solicit him to frame such a plan of government for the United States, as he knows they should adopt. That he will be elected by Baltimore-Town,3 I take for granted, provided he can be prevailed on to serve—he will therefore appear in the convention, and it would not be amiss if he should now engage in the arduous business, and have his plan ready before the meeting. The instructions are further to require that this most excellent plan be published, with a proposal to have new conventions called in the different States, for its ultimate ratification and unalterable confirmation. The address and instructions may be drawn by some able writer, such as the author of those masterly productions, published some years ago, under the signatures of Tom Tell Truth and Caveto.4 If that author be still living, and equal to his former self in literary compositions, he should by all means be engaged—Thus shall America be a happy nation indeed, and I see no other method of establishing her safety. Mr. M—— will naturally be appointed to any office he may provide for himself under the new federal government, and his saved country shew herself GRATEFUL,"
Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/18/1788,"Extract of a letter from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to a gentleman in this city, dated Feb. 10, 1788. “Agreeably to your request, I shall endeavour to give you the outlines of the principal characters, most forward in opposing Mr. Martin’s publication, respecting his examination at the bar of the house of assembly of this state; but the present will be only an imperfect sketch, for the want of time—I may make amends hereafter. [“]From the first æra of the christian religion, the church claimed the prerogative of leading the van in all temporal, as well as spiritual concerns; either for the purpose of establishing or overthrowing governments, or fixing their own influence. The scripture hero, whose conduct suggested the foregoing reflection, appears to be one of the Lord’s fiercest masked lions, in promoting and adjusting the heavenly regulations of the new federal government. On every seventh day, he mounts the ramparts of the pulpit, with fiery looks and terrific aspect, from whence he deals out impending vengeance on the refractory self-willed unbelievers of the federal faith, with the same dexterity that jugglers draw ribbons from their mouths, to the great admiration of the gaping multitude. The laudable example thus set by this church militant hero, strongly entrenched in double fortified columns of silver curls, highly scented and powdered, like other old carnal, feathered headed coxcombs, has communicated the contagion of vain glory and self-created consequence to the descendent of a neighbouring convict, who joyfully enrolls himself in the lists of friends to the fashionable government, thereby no doubt to entail never fading honor upon himself and his illustrious ancestry. Precepts and examples, have powerful attractions, particularly so, when they veer towards the enchanting harbours of emolument; and so much so here of late, that our well-born, such as common waggoners, draymen, coblers and their immediate descendants, deputy pin-sellers, catch-poles and chimney sweeps, besides a legion of half starved runners, to whom particular districts are assigned for trumpeting the excellency of the new constitution, all, all, gaping for offices, for the comfort and support of themselves and their [323]reputable connexions; and it will be matter of universal regret, to every feeling mind, if so great a number of worthy candidates for public favour, should not be rewarded and promoted, in some degree, adequate to their intrinsic merit.”"
Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,2/26/1788,"Extract of a letter from Queen Ann’s county, Maryland, February 18, 1788. “Of all the arts practised by the advocates of the proposed system of arbitrary power, that of stopping all real information, and publishing a great deal of misinformation, they have been most successful in. At the time they dispaired of having even a respectable minority in the Massachusetts convention (as above three-fourths of the people of that state are in the opposition) these votaries of power were publishing that they would have three to one in the convention; in this manner have they deceived, and by this deception have they obtained considerable success. But they should remember the old proverb: Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein, and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. “In one of your papers is an extract of a letter, from this state, declaring that there will be a majority of two to one in favor of the proposed system in our convention; now this is absolutely a great falsehood, it will be quite the reverse; above three-fourths of the Western, and at least one-third of the Eastern Shores are warmly opposed to it. Mr. Martin, who has great influence here, has let the cat out of the bag; and none of his colleagues have dared to contradict any thing he has said, except a trifling circumstance concerning the New-York deputies; but Mr. Martin has since proved this fact, and Mr. Jenifer is left in the lurch"
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,Aristides,2/29/1788,"A bill of rights is an useless, if not a dangerous thing; and a standing army, a bugbear, an hobgoblin to freighten children.2—This seems to [326]me the doctrine of Aristides, and the common language abroad.—What amazing progress in political knowledge have the Americans made in the last ten years! Should they go on improving by such laudable and rapid discoveries, what may we not expect in the course of a few years to come? Nothing less, surely, than a demonstration, that liberty is a visionary phantom, fleeting forever from our embrace—never intended for the possession of mankind, and never existing but in the enthusiastic imaginations of some illustrious madmen. We talk now with the utmost confidence of our own experience, and an appeal to the history of mankind, is considered as an insult on the sagacity and understanding, of the choice and master spirits of this age.3— That we are the wisest people under the sun, seems to be no longer disputed, and those whose youthful vanity has been flattered, by a transient public applause, think that because they have come later into the world, they have therefore all the wisdom and experience, of those who have gone before them—This is the opinion of the Americans now.—Machiavelli informs us, that it was the firm persuasion of the Florentines, his countrymen, in his day, and Peter Kolben relates the same thing of the Hottentots when he was amongst them4—perhaps the greatest share of confidence is inseperably united with the greatest share of ignorance. Notwithstanding all this, human nature has always been, and always will continue the same, and so long will it be impossible to put old heads upon young shoulders.—It is as unnatural to be guided by the experience of others, as for one man to see with another’s eyes. This fatal and unalterable law of nature, is founded not less on our presumption and confidence, than on a persuasion, which the young and unexperienced always feel, that there is some peculiar circumstance, that distinguishes their own particular case, from that which a father describes to a son, or an historian to posterity.—Where our vanity is not strong enough to despise, inclination will invent an excuse to avoid the lessons of experience; and where the passions do not entirely command, they are sure to blind the understanding. Is there one branch of science, literary knowledge, or even art, pleasing or useful to an individual, or society, that has received any improvement from the earliest records of time?—Homer, Theocritus, Pindar and Sophocles are yet unrivalled in poetry.—Thucydides, Polybius and Livy surpass all who have followed them in history.—Demosthenes and Cicero in eloquence.—Socrates, Plato and Plutarch in those moral lessons which form the human heart to virtue.—We penetrate into Grecian forests, and dive into the Tyber to rescue the relics of ancient [327]architecture, painting, sculpture and statuary; and preserve them as the most precious and perfect models of art.—Although, perhaps, gunpowder was unknown, yet they contrived to slaughter men enough without it, and the invention has only put the cowardice of a dastardly slave in uniform, more on a level with the manly exertions of an undisciplined freeman.—The invention of printing, the most important of all modern discoveries, has rather multiplied books than increased knowledge; nor has the discovery of an eighth planet5 brought with it any remedy for the inclemencies of a cold winter.—Our acquaintance with the skies is as useless as balloons. There is nothing solid or useful that is new—And I will venture to assert, that if every political institution is not fully explained by Aristotle, and other ancient writers, yet that, there is no new discovery in this the most important of all sciences, for ten centuries back. Our politicians of an hour, of an empire of a day, boast of government by representation, as a most important improvement; and whilst they discant on its excellencies they do not scruple to assert, that it was unknown to the ancients(a).—Some, indeed, have confined it to the British and their descendants. Government, by representatives, freely chosen by the body of the people, is as old as the history of mankind, and once formed the basis of every European government now existing; but as it is the most liable to corruption, it has always proved of the shortest duration; it has first degenerated into aristocracy, or the government of a few wealthy individuals, and has terminated regularly by a monarchy and standing army.—The reasoning on this progress is not essential at this moment, but as to the antiquity of government by representation, example must be produced to expose an error as general as it is surprizing. The first legal government of Athens, the most ancient we have any authentic history of, was by Archons elected by the body of the people, first for one and then for five years. Solon divided the legislative from the executive, as we have done, although not exactly in the same form.—This government lasted a very few years, and was destroyed by Pisistratus, assisted by a small standing force.—The examples drawn from several modern governments of Europe will be presently adduced.— But before this, it is essential that we examine what is meant by monarchy and aristocracy:—Unhappily for mankind frequent and ridiculous dispute is the least inconvenience arising from the imperfection of language.—Ambiguity and uncertainty of expression admit the imposition of dangerous doctrine, and produce more misfortune than error—Because in the government, from which we separated, the monarchy and aristocracy were attended with certain hereditary names and titles, [328]we are to be compelled to view the substance of those powers as inseperable from those forms and titles. Formerly the public authority exercised by one person, whether dignified with the title of Emperor, King, Stadtholder, Doge, &c. was elective, and generally revocable—as for instance, the ancient Emperors of Rome; the Emperors of Germany; the Emperor of Russia; the Kings of Denmark and Sweden; the Stadtholder of Holland; Doge of Genoa, &c.—They were seldom entrusted with any legislative power.—These various offices and titles, have all become hereditary, and have generally swallowed up the legislative power; except the Doge, who is only the pageant of the day, decorated with the tinsel trappings of authority, but not entrusted with the most trifling portion of its substance. Three great families have established an hereditary despotism over three-fourths of the habitable globe.—The house of Holstein, who now govern Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, great part of Poland, Germany, and the greatest part of Asia, within two centuries has sprung from a gentleman of less fortune than many Americans now possess.—The house of Austria, who have usurped the Imperial office of Germany, as a patrimony, and govern a great proportion of Europe, are derived, within a few centuries back, from a poor Count of Hapsburg without fortune or honor—And the mighty race of Bourbon, who possess France, Spain, the two Sicilies, two-thirds of America, and extensive dominions in Asia and Africa, sprung not long since from Hugh Capel, who, if he was not the son of a butcher (as is generally believed) was certainly of very low extraction.—There is not a kingdom in Europe, that does not contain many better families than these,—that is families, that have been longer people of property, and produced more illustrious men; but they are all involved in one common fate, reduced to a despicable slavery by these individuals, whose usurpations have been as successful as rapid, and who hold them in trembling subjection by numerous standing armies.—This is the history of monarchy divested of its glitter and pomp. Where wealth is hereditary, power is hereditary, for wealth is power—Titles are of very little, or no consequence—The rich are nobility, and the poor plebeans in all countries—And on this distinction alone, the true definition of aristocracy depends.—An aristocracy is that influence of power, which property may have in government; a democracy is the power or influence of the people or numbers, as contradistinguished from property. Machiavelli exposes the futility of an attempt to establish an aristocracy, upon any other principles than the solid distinction of property.6—In examining the principles of those artistocracies that now exist, we shall find hereditary wealth the only universally pervading principle and characteristic. In England the aristocracy have hereditary titles, and share in the legislature.—It is preserved by the power of the King to add the most wealthy and able of the commons to this order;—and if that principle, by which George Neville, Duke of Bedford, was degraded from his nobility on account of his poverty, still continued, it would be the most perfect and confirmed aristocracy in the world.—Although this aristocracy is extremely powerful, yet from the happy temperature of the government, by three well constituted estates, it has not proved oppressive; on the contrary, a firm rock, that has preserved this system from every shock of innovation.—Were the other two estates even as perfect as the aristocracy, the government might last forever. In Scotland, the aristocracy have hereditary titles, but they are almost entirely deprived of any share in the legislature, and their power is much broken by the axe and confiscation. In Holland, the aristocracy is composed of the wealthiest.—They hold their power for life most commonly, though in some instances for a limited time;—and elections are generally, though by no means universally abolished. Their estates are hereditary, but they have no titles.—Such is the aristocracy of America, yet in its infancy, and that of the aristocratic Cantons of Switzerland,—and they are all the most odious, oppressive and abominable aristocratics in the world;—for as their power is exclusively derived from wealth, which is more frequently the reward of iniquity and oppression than merit,—iniquity and oppression will be therefore openly and without shame practised to secure that wealth, which attended by power, defends its possessor from punishment. In France and Spain, the aristocracies are decorated with titles, but have no share in the legislature, yet still they are almost as powerful as the former, from their wealth;—but not so oppressive.—This wealth they hold by those fundamental laws which secure the descent of property from ancestors to heirs, on the preservation of which the King’s safety, in a great measure, depends.—In fine, in all governments by representation or delegation of power, where property is secured by fixed and permanent laws, from the rage of the populace on one side, and the tyranny of a despot on the other, the aristocracy will and must rule; that is a number of the wealthiest individuals, and the heads of great families:—The perfection of all political wisdom is so to temper this aristocracy as to prevent oppression. Between these two powers, the aristocracy and democracy, that is the rich and poor, there is a constant warfare.—Sir William Temple observes, that all the disputes, factions and revolutions in government spring from this source,—that the rich want to keep what they have [330]got, and the poor to take it from them;7—this is the favourable side of aristocracy, and is true where numbers unqualified by property have too great a weight in government.—Hence in such States, agrarian laws, and an abolition of debts, are always agitated; but this is only the infancy of government.—So long as the rich, only mean honestly to secure what they have lawfully gained, by their own or the industry of their ancestors, the contest is of short duration, and government, at an early period is so far strengthened as to secure property; but it is then, that the corruption of human nature discovers itself—the more we have, the more we want, and the possession of one object, becomes only the means of attaining another.—The aristocracy who move by system and design, and always under the colourable pretext of securing property, act as has been frequently said like the screw in mechanics, always gaining, holding fast what it gains, and never loosing; and in the event has ever proved an overmatch for the multitude, who never act but from their feelings, and are never permitted to feel until it is too late; and whose ineffectual violence, being generally attended by the outrages of despair, involves their cause in odium and horror. Hence it is that unsuccessful popular insurrections have always been succeeded by a general disposition favourable to tyranny. A great and good man has said, that an aristocracy in their progress to power is the most correct of all governments—after they have attained it, the most corrupt and abominable on earth.—The honest emoluments of office, are too few to gratify the many, who must be interested in administration in order to render it effectual,—they first connive at each other,—bad laws are made,—the good are perverted and avoided,—in fine, oppression becomes general, and the multitude in a paroxism of despair generally conclude, that it is better to suffer the tyranny of one man, than one hundred. The only remedy the ingenuity of man has discovered for this evil is—a properly constituted and independent executive,—a vindex injuriarum—an avenger of public wrongs; who with the assistance of a third estate, may enforce the rigor of equal law on those who are otherwise above the fear of punishment; and who may expose to public view and inquiry, those who screen their peculations under the sanction of office:—How well the new proposed federal or national government, for it is a government of individuals, not of States, has provided for this great end of all government, by uniting the executive with the aristocracy, or senate, tempting the aristocracy with every executive power that can rouse or stimulate their ambition,—and how the executive will be enabled to discharge its duty against those, without whose consent it [331]cannot act, I leave to the sensible and discerning part of my fellow-citizens. A senate should not only be composed of men of ripe age, where the violent passions have quitted the mental field, overcome by the vigor of judgment, but its chief perfection consists in such organization, that content with more than independence and a very respectable situation, they should be cut off from the active exercise of those powers which gratify personal ambition and tend to self aggrandizement or that of their friends, relatives and dependants:—That this feature of the constitution—that this union of the senate and executive will prove fatal to the liberty and happiness of America, unless corrected, I cannot doubt;—as I shall adduce examples of the same form of government, only not quite so bad as ours, terminating in despotism and a standing army, almost as soon as established.—For once let mankind listen to the counsel of experience:—This form of government is not new, it is the same form as that established in Denmark and Sweden, previous to the late revolutions, and exactly such a form as a number of wealthy and well disposed individuals, deliberately set to work, have made, and forever will make, in every age and every clime.—These examples will shew that ruin comes from a quarter entirely unexpected—they will, I hope, entirely disperse the delusion which now misleads our judgments, when we hug ourselves in the security, that we cannot be betrayed by representatives chosen every two years;—let every man, of any property, who has been active in the late revolution, and who is tolerably apprized of the sentiments of the people at large, scrutinize his own judgment; and let him ask himself whether in even the present disposition of the lower orders of our citizens, who bear with great impatience and reluctance their present inconveniences and incumberances, and those trifling distinctions and pre-eminences, which our present disinterested forms of government afford so trifling, that offices almost go a begging,—if in the event of the proposed plan the burthens of government should be encreased, greater distinctions among citizens arise, and emoluments of office be augmented—Will not the multitude croud with joy to the standard erected by any man in whom they have the least confidence, who will promise them vengeance on those whom they will consider as the authors of all their misfortunes, and to rid them at once of the evils of complicated government and numerous officers, whom they always think they pay, only to plunder them? To attempt to form a government composed simply of aristocracy and democracy—where rich and poor are jointly to govern—is long of yore represented in the fable of the league between the wolves and [332]sheep—The sheep were soon compelled to recall the shepherd and his dogs.8— But let us here for a moment return to Aristides.—He asks, what European power is without a standing army? and which has lost its liberties by them?9 Many of his remarks betray a misrecollection of the A, B, C, of politics, and some of the historical questions discover a total absence of memory.—It may be answered, that both political and civil liberty have long since ceased to exist in almost all the countries that now employ standing troops, and that their slavery has in every instance been effected and maintained by the instrumentality and invariable obedience of these living machines to their chief.—I grant that the discontent of the people under the oppressions of a complicated aristocratical government has always paved the way to the despotism of one man;—the progress is natural, troops must be raised in such circumstances to compel an unwilling obedience to the laws—these troops must not be part of the discontented—they cannot be trusted—they must not feel like them, and must therefore have separate interests—they must be paid and well paid—they must be admitted to a preference and pre-eminence over those whom they subdue—Here are new taxes and new oppressions, which cause insurrections.—A foreign enemy is expected to take advantage of the confusion; the people are not to be trusted—Your liberties (as they will then be called) must be committed to the guardianship of the standing army—a day which, as I am informed, a member in the late convention declared he wished to see10—The people look anxiously for the punishment of their oppressors, and they look up to that man who will gratify their revenge on the aristocracy.—All senates have been, and always will be for raising standing troops, notwithstanding they have invariably found to their destruction, that no oaths can prevent them, from following the fortunes of a favourite leader, whose orders their rigid discipline has accustomed them to obey.— That this is not the painting of a warm imagination, the history of those governments that were far less complicated and onerous than ours must prove, will evidence—Thirteen complicated forms all under one form of government, still more complicated, seem to bid defiance to all responsibility, (the only test of good government) as it can never be discovered where the fault lies—the blame will be shifted from the States to Congress—from Congress to the States—from one State to another, and so from one shoulder to another, until investigation is tired—the burthen of double government complete throughout, when we can scarce support its expence single.—This double officering from front to rear, will prove so extremely burthensome, and above all, this [333]double set of laws will afford so plentiful an harvest of oppression and confusion, that I do not see what right we have to expect a more fortunate fate, than those nations who had happier and fairer prospects. Let us now view the catastrophes of these governments.—⟨First of Sweden—previous to the year 1772—the States or legislature was composed of four orders—I. Nobility, who were only as we are informed the heads of the wealthiest families represented in a senate by selection—the old nobility having been almost to a man extirpated by that Nero of the North, Christian IId, who made a general massacre of the order assisted by the populace, who hunted them like bloodhounds—II. The clergy—III. The citizens chosen by the magistrates and common council of each corporation, their number about 150—IV. The farmers, chosen in each district by a majority of voices out of the landholders, their number 180.—It would seem as if theory could hardly invent a more perfect legislature.—The executive was committed to one man, dignified indeed by the title of King, a word to which we attach ideas unauthorized by its meaning—but this King however (who was elected for life) was in fact, hardly more than a president of the senate, without whose concurrence he could exercise none of the important powers belonging to the executive branch:⟩11—Although the King and every officer, civil and military, were sworn to support this constitution, yet there was but one military officer found who regarded this oath, when solicited by Gustavus to take a contrary oath to support its usurpation.—This singular man had the courage to declare, that the Prince ought to have no confidence in him, if he should by one oath violate another.—A few grenadiers with bayonets fixed, ordered to the senate-room, and a very few regiments previously prepared, effected the most sudden and unexpected revolution that ever mankind were the melancholy witnesses of.—A few days after the King published that form of government, which it was his will and pleasure the Swedes and their posterity should be governed by—The Americans ought to read it—they will find it in William’s history of Northern Governments.—In the preface is this remarkable passage: “We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, Senators, States, Counts, Barons, Bishops, Knights, and Nobles, Military Officers, Citizens, and Commons, who are actually here assembled, make known for us and our absent citizens and commons, that many of our citizens under the name of liberty had assumed a power and domination that was insupportable, &c. &c. &c.”12 In Denmark, the revolution in 1666, presents exactly the same story over again.—The constitution was the same as in Sweden precisely, senate, representatives of the people, and an executive elected for life, clogged in the same manner by the senate.—The representatives of [334]the people became at last so tired of the senate, that they made a formal offer of their liberties to Frederick IIId, and actually compelled the senate to give their assent.—This man whose moderation and real disinterested virtue had captivated the affections of all ranks, with the assistance of 24,000 troops, selected chiefly from foreign vagabonds, established the most despotic government, that ever mankind groaned under for them and their posterity;13—and no doubt with the best intentions, as from his declaration we find he believed what Mr. Pope has wrote, and what many good, but mistaken men, both in Europe and America, have thought and now think— For forms of government let fools contest That which is best administered, is best.14— and as for the good administration he thought he could very well trust that to himself and his posterity. It was thus that the hardy descendants of the Goths and Vandals lost their liberties, and from the boldest and most enterprizing they have degenerated into the most miserable and depressed of mankind, the country depopulated, commerce destroyed, dirty minions, and court-favourites plundering every-thing and nothing flourishing but the standing army.—For the truth of this picture I refer to William’s history. In Holland, at this moment, the standing troops adhering to the Stadtholder (who from the best accounts proved a traitor to his country last war) in conjunction with those bred under that grand Prince of despots, the late King of Prussia, have disarmed the Burghers, the national militia, and are now changing the form of government, under the pretext of throwing power into the hands of the States-General, but actually paving the way for the hereditary despotism of William of Nassau. It is so long since the other States of Europe have lost all semblance of liberty, that it may be difficult to trace their revolutions.—In France the oppressions of the aristocracy enabled first the politic Lewis IId, and afterwards Lewis XIIIth, and Cardinal Richlieu, by the assistance of the mob and standing army, since become the standing law of France, to destroy every vestige of freedom. In Spain the immense estates, which by the six fortunate marriages of the house of Austria (as they are called) became concentered in the person of Charles Vth.—The mines of the two Indies then lately discovered which became the property of his family, and above all the obstinacy of that hardy, disinterested and frugal priest, Ximenes, finished at a blow the power of the Cortes, who were chiefly composed of representatives elected by the people in the several States of Old and New Castile, Arragon, Catalonia, &c.—For Spain was at that time divided [335]into as many States almost as we are, and perhaps more independent of each other, having separate legislatives and executives, and the general power not entrusted with the right of taxation.—However, a standing army has from that time destroyed all hopes of a revolution in favour of the rights of mankind. It will be asked how has England preserved her liberties, with at least an apparent standing army?—I answer, she did loose them; but as there was no standing army until lately, she regained them again:—She lost them under the Tudors, who broke the then oppressive power of the aristocracy, but the unparalleled avarice of Henry VIIth, the boundless extravagance of Henry VIIIth, the short reign of Edward VIth, (which was but the sickly blaze of a dying candle) the bigotry of that weak woman Mary, who had no other object than religious persecution, and lastly the parsimony of Elizabeth, who had no children of her own to provide for, and who hated her legal successor and his family—all conspired to prevent their establishing a military standing force, sufficient to secure their usurpations; and the nation recovered from their paroxism under the Stuarts, who were too weak and too wicked to command even respect, notwithstanding their dignity.—On the revolution in 1688, the patriots of that day formed some glorious bulwarks, which seem as yet to have secured them from the evils and danger of their present standing army, though still in my opinion, they hold their remaining liberties by a very precarious tenure indeed, as the first enterprizing and popular Prince will most probably convince them. Let us now examine these defences and compare them with those of the proposed constitution. ⟨In England, by their bill of rights, a standing army is declared to be contrary to their constitution, and a militia the only natural and safe defence of a free people.—This keeps the jealousy of the nation constantly awake, and has proved the foundation of all the other checks. In the American constitution, there is no such declaration, or check at all. In England, the military are declared by their constitution to be in all cases subordinate to the civil power; and consequently the civil officers have always been active in supporting this pre-eminence. In the American constitution, there is no such declaration. In England, the mutiny bill can only be passed from year to year, or on its expiration every soldier is as free, and the equal by law of the first general officer of the land.15 In America, the articles of war (which is the same thing) has been already considered as perpetual (as I am well informed) under even the [336]present Congress,16 although the constitutions of all the States positively forbid any standing troops at all, much less laws for them. In England, the appropriation of money for the support of their army must be from year to year; in America it may be for double the period. How favorable is this contrast to Britain—that Britain which we lavished our blood and treasure to separate ourselves from, as a country of slavery—But we then held different sentiments from those now become so fashionable; for this I appeal to the constitutions of the several States. In the declaration of rights of Massachusetts, sect. 17.—The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military power shall always be held in exact subordination to the civil authority, and be governed by it. Sect. 27. In time of peace, no soldier ought to be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, such quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a manner ordained by the legislature.17 Declaration of rights of Pennsylvania, sect. 13.—That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State; and as standing armies in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by the civil power.18 Declaration of rights of Maryland, sect. 25.—That a well regulated militia is the proper and natural defence of a free government. Sect. 26. That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept without consent of the legislature. Sect. 27. That in all cases and at all times the military ought to be under strict subordination to, and controul of the civil power. Sect. 28. That no soldier ought to be quartered in any house in time of peace, without the consent of the owner; and in time of war, in such manner only as the legislature shall direct.19 Declaration of rights of Delaware, in the same words as Maryland.20 Declaration of rights of North-Carolina, sect. 17.—That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of the State; and as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by the civil power.21 Constitution of South-Carolina, sect. 42.—That the military be subordinate to the civil power of the State.22 But we are told by Aristides, that our poverty is our best security against many standing troops.—Are we then, and our posterity, always to [337]be poor? This security would certainly cease with our poverty; but the truth is, our poverty instead of preventing will be the first cause of the increase of a standing army.—Our poverty will render the people less able to pay the few troops it is admitted we must keep.—This expence added to the immense public and private debts, which an efficient government seems to be requisite to enforce payment of, together with the onerous and complicated civil governments, both Continental and State, will be productive of future uneasiness and discontent.—The most sanguine among us must expect some turbulence and commotion; let the smallest appearance of commotion peep out again in any part of the Continent, and there is not a rich man in the United States, who will think himself or his property safe, until both are surrounded with standing troops. This is the only public purpose for which these men ever did, or ever will willingly contribute their money. But then, according to their laudable custom, they must have interest for their advances;—this increases the public burthens—Commotion is followed by commotion, until the spirit of the people is broken and sunk by the halter, the scaffold, and a regular standing army.⟩23— Yet notwithstanding this I am as sensible as Aristides, that a few troops will be necessary for the United States, for those very services which he says it would be oppressive to a free people constantly to execute.—The western territory, some guards, arsenals and posts whenever our finances will admit our attention to that safe and honorable defence, a navy—will require a few men in constant pay. But it is this necessity that alone causes all my apprehension. There is no public abuse that does not spring from the necessary use of power,—it is that insensible progress from the use to the abuse, that has led mankind through scenes of calamity and woe, that make us now shrink back with horror, from the history of our species. Do we not see at this moment, that even the present Congress have been compelled by necessity to embody and maintain troops in time of peace for these purposes; and yet the raising or maintaining one man is as complete a violation of the bill of rights of the several States, as the raising 100,000.—This necessary infraction of the only check that existed, has already taught all America to view the approach of a standing army, with composure and indifference, nay when a limitation of the evil is proposed, Aristides asks without hesitation—how shall we distinguish between peace and a threatened war? Shall we not be surprized, unprepared? I must confess that from the vigor and resolution with which we began the erection of these our fabrics of freedom, I was persuaded that the grave would have closed on my bones, before this question would be publicly proposed in America.—Are we then to look up to a standing army for the defence of this soil from foreign invasion? Have [338]we forgot that a few freemen of Sparta defended their country against a million of Persian slaves? Have not an handful of free Swiss farmers, defended their country against the numerous veteran armies, which Burgandy, Austria and Bourbon have led against them? They beat them among their rocks, and then descended into the plains and beat them, and they will beat them forever on any ground, to all eternity, whilst they remain free and are defending that freedom.—Did it not cost the Spaniards more time and blood to subdue a few republican unarmed Indians, on the little island of Gran Canaria, than they expended in the destruction of the mighty empires of Mexico and Peru, defended by numerous standing armies? Did their arms meet with any resistance on this Continent, until they penetrated to the free republics of Chili?—I had rather trust the defence of a country to the savage valour of a few Shawnesse and Delawares, who live in freedom and value the blessing, than to the numerous hosts of civilized slaves that surround the thrones of Delhi, Pekin and Ispahan—But a few years have elapsed since that feather of a King, Lewis XIVth, overrun all Holland in a few days, and became master, almost without resistance, of that country which the veteran infantry of Spain, led by the most celebrated Captains, an age of chivalry produced, Alva, Alexander Farneza, and the Marquis Spinola, were forced to gain inch by inch, from a few desperate Burghers. When the French troops came, the people were universally discontented with the oppressions of the rich, as soon as they had reeked a brutal vengeance on the aristocracy, the latent courage of the nation revived, and Lewis was obliged to scamper off as fast as he came.—Let the body of the people be interested in the defence of a good government, and my countrymen need not fear being surprized by all the slaves and brutes that the despots of the old and new world can arm against them.—There will then need no distinction of a threatened war, and our establishment may at all times be limited to the purposes just mentioned.— But perhaps standing troops may be wanted to suppress domestic insurrections? The people cannot be trusted to [punish?] the people, is becoming a cant expression; but I fervently hope by no means a general sentiment. I am free to declare, that I never wish to see any measure of government enforced by arms, which the yeomanry of the United States will not turn out to support. ⟨My countrymen! never forget this truth, which the sad experience of your fellow-mortals has witnessed with their blood!—Remember it yourselves!—Engrave it on the tender minds of your children, as the first article of their political creed—that, There is no form of government safe with a standing army, and there is none that is not safe without.—A [339]people may frequently be so unfortunate as to loose their liberties. They may be so foolish as to give them away, as in Denmark, where not only the senators and representatives of the people, but also every man in the whole empire of the smallest note, or consequence, signed a formal surrender of their liberties on an instrument now kept in the archives of that kingdom24—an everlasting monument of—how catching a thing this signing of names is; or of what is now called—a modest deference for the opinion of others. But whether they loose them, or give them away, they will soon regain them, or resume them, unless they are prevented by a standing army⟩25—And also recollect, my fellow-citizens, That what is doctrine to day, may be treason to-morrow. (a) Is it not strange to hear the Governor of Connecticut, gravely asserting in their Convention,26 the novelty of government by representation, and pinning all his hopes of our future happiness, and exemption from evil on this new discovery! And yet the Governor of Connecticut is not only one of the worthiest of our citizens, but rather of uncommon information in a country, where very few are so independent in their fortunes as to afford much time to study."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,3/7/1788,"There are but two modes by which men are connected in society, the one which operates on individuals, this always has been, and ought still to be called, national government; the other which binds States and governments together (not corporations, for there is no considerable nation on earth, despotic, monarchical, or republican, that does not contain many subordinate corporations with various constitutions) this last has heretofore been denominated a league or confederacy.—The term federalists is therefore improperly applied to themselves, by the friends and supporters of the proposed constitution.—This abuse of language does not help the cause,—every degree of imposition serves only to irritate, but can never convince.—They are national men, and their opponents, or at least a great majority of them, are federal, in the only true and strict sense of the word.— Whether any form of national government is preferable for the Americans, to a league or confederacy, is a previous question we must first make up our minds upon.—There will then remain still another—Whether, if any, is the one proposed the best, in our circumstances safe, and such a one as we should unconditionally receive? and if ever duty required deliberation before decision, it calls for it now, and in terms too strong to be resisted or evaded.—Let the light come in free from every quarter. If reason cannot satisfy, experiment will determine. But even then, is it not the duty of those to whom the happiness of so great a proportion of the human species is entrusted, to conduct that experiment with the utmost coolness and fairness, with all those precautions which the wisdom of antiquity affords, and finally qualified with those securities to our liberty, that, should it prove oppressive or impracticable, ourselves, or at least our posterity, may not be prevented, by the power or influence of a civil or military oligarchy, from adopting the alternative? The advantages or disadvantages of national government, open too wide a field of discussion for my leisure or talents.—Some few remarks I shall cursorily offer. That a national government will add to the dignity and encrease the splendour of the United States abroad, can admit of no doubt: It is essentially requisite for both. That it will render government, and officers of government, more dignified at home is equally certain. That these objects are more suited to the manners, if not genius and disposition of our people is, I fear, also true. That it is requisite in order to keep us at peace among ourselves, is doubtful. That it is necessary, to prevent foreigners from dividing us, or interfering in our government, I deny positively; and after all, I have strong doubts whether all its advantages are not more specious than solid.—We are vain, like other nations,—we wish to make a noise in the world; and feel hurt that Europeans are not so attentive to America in peace, as they were to America in war. We are also, no doubt, desirous of cutting a figure in history.—Should we not reflect, that quiet is happiness?—That content and pomp are incompatible?—I have either read or heard this truth, which the Americans should never forget,—That the silence of historians is the surest record of the happiness of a people.—The Swiss have been four hundred years the envy of mankind, and there is yet scarcely an history of their nation. What is history, but a disgusting and painful detail of the butcheries of conquerors, and the woeful calamities of the conquered? Many of us are proud, and are frequently disappointed that office confers neither respect or difference. No man of merit can ever be disgraced by office. A rogue in office may be feared in some governments—he will be respected in none.—After all, what we call respect and difference only arise from contrast of situation, as most of our ideas come by comparison and relation. Where the people are free there can be no great contrast, or distinction among honest citizens in or out of office.—In proportion as the people loose their freedom, every gradation of distinction, between the Governors and governed obtains, until the former become masters, and the latter become slaves. In all governments virtue will command reverence.—The divine Cato knew every Roman citizen by name, and never assumed any pre-eminence; yet Cato found, and his memory will find, respect and reverence in the bosoms of mankind, until this world returns into that nothing, from whence Omnipotence called it.—That the people are not at present disposed for, and are actually incapable of, governments of simplicity and equal rights, I can no longer doubt—But whose fault is it? We make them bad, by bad governments, and then abuse and despise them for being so. Our people are capable of being made any thing, that human nature was or is capable of, if we would only have a little patience and [367]give them good and wholesome institutions; but I see none such and very little prospect of such.—Alas! I see nothing in my fellow-citizens, that will permit my still fostering the delusion, that they are now capable of sustaining the weight of self-government: A burthen to which Greek and Roman shoulders proved unequal.—The honor of supporting the dignity of the human character, seems reserved to the hardy Helvetians alone.—If the body of the people will not govern themselves, and govern themselves well too, the consequence is unavoidable.—A few will, and must govern them.—Then it is that government becomes truly a government by force only,—where men relinquish part of their natural rights to secure the rest, instead of an union of will and force, to protect all their natural rights, which ought to be the foundation of every rightful social compact.—Whether national government will be productive of internal peace, is too uncertain to admit of decided opinion.—I only hazard a conjecture when I say, that our state disputes, in a confederacy, would be disputes of levity and passion, which would subside before injury.—The people being free, government having no right to them, but they to government, they would separate and divide as interest or inclination prompted—as they do at this day, and always have done, in Switzerland—In a national government, unless cautiously and fortunately administered, the disputes will be the deep-rooted differences of interest, where part of the empire must be injured by the operation of general law; and then should the sword of government be once drawn (which Heaven avert) I fear it will not be sheathed, until we have waded through that series of desolation, which France, Spain, and the other great kingdoms of the world have suffered, in order to bring so many separate States into uniformity, of government and law; in which event the legislative power can only be entrusted to one man (as it is with them) who can have no local attachments, partial interests, or private views to gratify. That a national government will prevent the influence or danger of foreign intrigue, or secure us from invasion, is in my judgment directly the reverse of the truth:—The only foreign, or at least evil foreign influence, must be obtained through corruption.—Where the government is lodged in the body of the people, as in Switzerland, they can never be corrupted; for no prince, or people, can have resources enough to corrupt, the majority of a nation;—and if they could, the play is not worth the candle.—The facility of corruption is encreased in proportion as power tends by representation or delegation, to a concentration in the hands of a few.—The French have kept a minister in Switzerland for 300 years back to persuade them to place power in their General Assembly or Diet.—The Swiss have always proved faithful allies and [368]friends to France,—but have laughed at her political advice—as the assembly of Foxes treated with derision the curtailed Reynard—who advised them to part with their cumbersome quantity of brush.(a)—As to any nation attacking a number of confederated independent republics, who are always as populous as brave, it is not to be expected, more especially as the wealth of the empire is there universally diffused, and will not be collected into any one overgrown, luxurious and effeminate capital to become a lure to the enterprizing ambitious.—That extensive empire is a misfortune to be deprecated, will not now be disputed.—The balance of power has long engaged the attention of all the European world, in order to avoid the horrid evils of a general government.—The same government pervading a vast extent of territory, terrifies the minds of individuals into meanness and submission.—All human authority, however organized, must have confined limits,—or insolence and oppression will prove the offspring of its grandeur,—and the difficulty or rather impossibility of escape prevents resistance.—Gibbon relates that some Roman Knights who had offended government in Rome were taken up in Asia, in a very few days after.2—It was the extensive territory of the Roman republic that produced a Sylla, a Marius, a Caligula, a Nero, and an Eliagabalus.—In small independent States contiguous to each other, the people run away and leave despotism, to reek its vengeance on itself; and thus it is that moderation becomes with them, the law of self-preservation.—These and such reasons founded on the eternal and immutable nature of things have long caused and will continue to cause much difference of sentiment throughout our wide extensive territories.—From our divided and dispersed situation, and from the natural moderation of the American character, it has hitherto proved a warfare of argument and reason. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journnal,Landholder No. X,3/7/1788,"Mr. Goddard, Sir, In consequence of the justice I did Mr. Gerry, on a former occasion, I find myself complimented with an Address in your last Paper.—Whether the Landholder of the Connecticut Courant, and of the Maryland Journal, is the same person, or different, is not very material;—I however incline to the former opinion, as I hope, for the honour of human nature, it would be difficult to find more than one individual, who could be capable of so total a disregard to the principles of truth and honour. After having made the most unjust and illiberal attack on Mr. Gerry, and stigmatized him as an enemy to his country, and the basest of mankind, for no other reason than a firm and conscientious discharge [372]of an important trust reposed in that gentleman, had I not come in for a share of his censure, I confess I should have been both disappointed and mortified—It would have had at least the appearance, that the Landholder had discovered something in my principles, which he considered congenial with his own—However great may be my political sins, to be cursed with his approbation and applause, would be a punishment much beyond their demerit. But, Sir, at present, I mean to confine myself to the original subject of controversy, the injustice of the charges made against Mr. Gerry. That my veracity will not be questioned when giving my negative to anonymous slander, I have the fullest confidence—I have equal confidence that it will be as little questioned by any who know me, even should the Landholder vouchsafe to give the Public his name1—a respectable name I am sure it cannot be—His absolute want of truth and candour in assertions meant to injure the reputation of individuals, whose names are given to the Public, and to hold them up to the indignation of their fellow-citizens, will ever justify this assertion, even should the name belong to one decorated with wealth, or dignified by station. But the Landholder wishes it to be supposed, that though my veracity should not be doubted, yet my evidence ought to be rejected, and observes, that to comprehend what credit ought to be given to it, (by which, I suppose, he means its sufficiency if credited) it ought to be known how long I was absent from Convention, as well as the time I attended. I believe, Sir, whoever will read my former publication, will in a moment perceive, that I there “stated” all the “information” on this subject, that was “necessary” or material, and that I left no defect for the Landholder to supply—I there mentioned, that “I took my seat early in June, that I left Philadelphia on the fourth of September, and during that period, was not absent from the Convention while sitting, except only five days in the beginning of August, immediately after the Committee of Detail had reported.” I did not state the precise day of June when I took my seat—it was the ninth, not the tenth—a very inconsiderable mistake of the Landholder—But between that day and the fourth of September, he says, that I was absent ten days at Baltimore, and as many at New-York; and thereby insinuates, that an absence of twenty days from the Convention intervened during that period, in which time Mr. Gerry might have made, and failed in, his motion concerning continental money. A short state of facts is all that is necessary to shew the disingenuity of the Landholder, and that it is very possible to convey a falsehood, [373]or something very much like it, almost in the words of truth—On the twenty-fifth [i.e., sixth] of July the Convention adjourned, to meet again on the sixth of August—I embraced that opportunity to come to Baltimore, and left Philadelphia on the twenty seventh; I returned on the fourth of August, and on the sixth attended the Convention, with such members as were in town, at which time the Committee of Detail made their report, and many of the members being yet absent, we adjourned to the next day—Mr. Gerry left Philadelphia to go to NewYork, the day before I left there to come to Baltimore; he had not returned on Tuesday the seventh of August,2 when I set out for New-York, from whence I returned and took my seat in Convention on Monday the thirteenth. It is true that from the twenty-fifth of July to the thirteenth of August, eighteen (not twenty) days had elapsed; but on one of those days I attended, and on twelve of them the Convention did not meet; I was therefore perfectly correct in my original statement, that from early in June till the fourth of September, I was absent but five days from the Convention while sitting, and in that statement omitted no “necessary information”—It is also true, that of those eighteen days Mr. Gerry was absent twelve or thirteen, and that one of those days when he was not absent was Sunday, on which day the Convention did not meet. Thus, Sir, by relating facts as they really occurred, we find the only time between early in June and the fourth of September, when such a motion could have been made by Mr. Gerry, without my being present, is narrowed down to four, or at most five days, as I originally stated it, although the Landholder wishes it should be supposed there were twenty days during that period, when it might have taken place without my knowledge, to wit, ten while I was at Baltimore, and as many more while at New-York. The Landholder also states, that the Convention commenced the fourteenth day of May, and that I did not take my seat till the tenth day of June, by which, if he means any thing, I presume he means to insinuate, that within that portion of time, Mr. Gerry’s motion might have been made and rejected. He is here, Sir, equally unfortunate and disingenuous—Though the Convention was to have met by appointment on the fourteenth of May, yet no material business was entered upon till on or about the thirtieth of that month: It was on that day that the Convention, having had certain propositions laid before them by the Honourable Governor of Virginia, resolved to go into a consideration of those propositions3—In this fact I am confident I am not mistaken, as I state the day not merely from my own recollection, from minutes, which I believe to be very correct, in my possession, of the information given by the Honourable Mr. McHenry, to the assembly.4 [374]The truth is, Sir, that very little progress had been made by the Convention before I arrived, and that they had not been more than ten days, or about that time, seriously engaged in business.—The first thing I did after I took my seat was carefully to examine the journals for information of what had already been done or proposed—I was also furnished with notes of the debates which had taken place, and can with truth say, that I made myself “minutely informed” of what had happened before that period—In the same manner, after my return from New-York, I consulted the journals, (for we were permitted to read them, although we were not always permitted to take copies)—If the motion attributed to Mr. Gerry, had been made and rejected either before I first took my seat, or while at New-York, it would have there appeared; and that no such motion was made and rejected during either of those periods, I appeal to the highest possible authority—I appeal to those very journals, which ought to have been published, and which we are informed are placed in the possession of our late Honourable President5—But why, Sir, should I appeal to those journals, or to any other authority? Let the Landholder turn to his eighth number, addressed to the Honourable Mr. Gerry—let him blush, unless incapable of that sensation, while he reads the following passage! “Almost the whole time during the sitting of the Convention, and until the constitution had received its present form, no man was more plausible and conciliating on every subject than Mr. Gerry,” &c. “Thus stood Mr. Gerry till towards the close of the business, he introduced a motion respecting the redemption of paper-money”6—The whole time of the sitting of the Convention was not almost past—The Constitution had not received its present form—nor was the business drawing towards a close until long after I took my seat in Convention. It is therefore proved by the Landholder himself, that Mr. Gerry did not make this motion at any time before the ninth day of June—Nay more, in the paper now before me he acknowledges, that in his eighth number he meant (and surely no one ought to know his meaning better than himself) “to fix Mr. Gerry’s apostacy to a period within the last thirteen days.[”]7 Why then all this misrepresentation of my absence at Baltimore and New-York? Why the attempt to induce a belief that the Convention had been engaged in business from the fourteenth of May, and the insinuation that it might have happened in those periods? And why the charge that in not stating those facts I had withheld from the public information necessary to its forming a right judgment of the credit which ought to be given to my evidence? But, Sir, I am really at a loss which most to admire, the depravity of this writer’s heart, or the weakness of his head!—Is it possible he [375]should not perceive that the moment he fixes the time of Mr. Gerry’s motion to the last thirteen days of the Convention, he proves incontestibly the falshood and malice of his charges against that gentleman? for he has expressly stated that this motion and the rejection it received was the cause, and the sole cause, of his apostacy; that “before, there was nothing in the system, as it now stands, to which he had any objection, but that afterwards he was inspired with the utmost rage and intemperate opposition to the whole system he had formerly praised;”8—whereas I have shewn to the clearest demonstration, that a considerable time before the last thirteen days, Mr. Gerry had given the most decided opposition to the system; I have shewn this by recital of facts, which if credited, incontestibly prove it—facts which I again repeat, will never be contradicted by any member of the Convention—I ground this assertion upon the fullest conviction, that it is impossible to find a single person in that number so wicked, as publicly and deliberately to prostitute his name in support of falsehood, and at the same time so weak as to do this when he must be sure of detection. But the Landholder is willing to have it supposed, that Mr. Gerry might have made the motion in a “Committee,” and that there it might have happened without my knowledge; to such wretched subterfuges is he driven. This evasion, however, will be equally unavailing. The business of the committees were not of a secret nature, nor were they conducted in a secret manner; I mean as to the members of the Convention. I am satisfied that there was no committee while I was there, of whose proceedings I was not at least “so minutely informed,”9 that an attempt of so extraordinary a nature as that attributed to Mr. Gerry, and attended with such an immediate and remarkable revolution in his conduct, could not have taken place without my having heard something concerning it.—The non-adoption of a measure by a committee did not preclude its being proposed to the Convention, and being there adopted. Can it be presumed that a question in which Mr. Gerry is represented to have been so deeply interested, and by the fate of which his conduct was entirely influenced, would, for want of success in a committee, have been totally relinquished by him, without a single effort to carry it in Convention?—If any other proof is wanting, I appeal again to the Landholder himself:—In his eighth number he states that the motion was rejected “by the Convention”—Let it be remembered also, as I have before observed, in the paper now before me, he declares it was his intention in that number to fix Mr. Gerry’s apostacy to a period within the last thirteen days; and in the same number he observes, that Mr. Gerry’s resentment could only embarrass and delay the completion of the business for a few days; all which equally militates [376]against every idea of the motion being made before I left Philadelphia, whether in Committee, or in Convention. The Landholder hath also asserted, that I have “put into Mr. Gerry’s mouth, objections different from any thing his letter to the legislature of his state contains, so that if my representation is true, his must be false.”10 In this charge he is just as well founded as in those I have already noticed.—Mr. Gerry has more than once published to the world, under the sanction of his name, that he opposed the system from a firm persuasion that it would endanger the liberties of America, and destroy the freedom of the states and their citizens.11 Every word which I have stated as coming from his mouth, so far from being inconsistent with those declarations, are perfectly correspondent thereto, and direct proofs of their truth. When the Landholder informed us that Mr. Gerry was “face to face with his colleagues in the Convention of Massachusetts,”12 why did he not, unless he wished to mislead the public, also inform us for what purpose he was there? That it was only to answer questions that might be proposed to him, not himself to ask questions—that he could not consistently interfere in any manner in the debates—and that he was even prohibited an opportunity of explaining such parts of his conduct as were censured in his presence.13 By the anonymous publication alluded to by the Landholder,14 and inserted in the note, Mr. Gerry’s colleagues are not called upon to acquit him; it only declares “that he believes them to be men of too much honour to assert that his reasons in Convention were totally different from those he published;”—and in this, I presume, he was not disappointed—the Landholder otherwise would have published it with triumph;—but if Mr. Gerry, as it is insinuated, was only prevented by pride from, in person, requesting them to acquit him, it amounts to a proof of his consciousness that, as men of honour, they could not have refused it, had he made the request. No person, who views the absurdities and inconsistencies of the Landholder, can, I think, have a very respectable opinion of his understanding; but I, who am not much prejudiced in his favour, could scarcely have conceived him so superlatively weak as to expect to deceive the public and obtain credit to himself, by asking “if the charges against Mr. Gerry are not true, why do not his colleagues contradict them?”15 and “why is it that we do not see Mr. McHenry’s verification of your assertions?”16—If these gentlemen were to do Mr. Gerry that justice, he might as well inquire “why is it we do not also see the verification” of A, B, C and D, and so on to the last letter of the conventional alphabet. When the Landholder, in his eighth number, addressed himself to Mr. Gerry, he introduced his charges by saying, “you doubtless will recollect the following state of facts;—if you do not, every member of the Convention will attest them.”17 One member of the Convention has had firmness sufficient to contradict them with his name, although he was well apprised that he thereby exposed himself as a mark for the arrows of his political adversaries, and as to some of them, he was not unacquainted with what kind of men he had to deal: But of all the members who composed that body, not one has yet stepped forward to make good the Landholder’s prediction; nor has one been found to “attest” his statement of facts. Many reasons may be assigned why the members of the Convention should not think themselves under a moral obligation of involving themselves in controversy, by giving their names in vindication of Mr. Gerry; and I do not believe any of those who signed the proposed Constitution would consider themselves bound to do this by any political obligation:—But, Sir, I can hardly suppose that Mr. Gerry is so perfectly esteemed and respected by every person who had a seat in that body, that not a single individual could possibly be procured to give his sanction to the Landholder’s charges, if it could be done with justice; and as to myself, I much question whether it would be easy to convince any person, who was present at our information to the assembly, that every one of my honourable colleagues (to each of whose merit I cordially subscribe, though compelled to differ from them in political sentiments) would be prevented by motives of personal delicacy to myself, from contradicting the facts I have stated relative to Mr. Gerry, if it could be done consistent with truth. If the Landholder was a member of the Convention, to facilitate the adoption of a favourite system, or to gratify his resentment against its opposers, he has originally invented, and is now labouring to support, charges the most unjust and ungenerous, contrary to his own knowledge of facts.—If he was not a member, he is acting the same part, without any knowledge of the subject, and in this has the merit of either following his own invention, or of dealing out the information he receives from some person of whom he is the wretched tool and dupe, at the same time expressing himself with a decision, and making such professions of being perfectly in every secret, as naturally tends, unless contradicted, to deceive and delude the unsuspecting multitude. In one of these predicaments the Landholder must stand—he is welcome to take his choice—in either case he only wants to be known to be despised. Now, Sir, let the Landholder come forward and give his name to the public—It is the only thing necessary to finish his character—and to convince the world that he is as dead to shame, as he is lost to truth and destitute of honour. If I, Sir, can be instrumental in procuring him to disclose himself; even in this I shall consider myself as rendering a service to my country.—I flatter myself, for the dignity of human kind, there are few such characters; but there is no situation in life, in which they may not prove the bane and curse of society;—they, therefore, ought to be known, that they may be guarded against. I am, Sir, your very humble servant, Baltimore, March 3, 1788."
Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,3/14/1788,"Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Maryland, to his friend in this city, dated March 4. “The convention of Boston I find have agreed to the new constitution, but in such a manner,2 as will, in my opinion, considerably affect the system. New-York, Maryland, Virginia, North and South-Carolina, will, I am persuaded, in imitation, propose amendments, and this new government will not be established without paying a deference to the desire of so large a part of the confederation. “If some amendments should be adopted, it will be all right, and the efforts of the minority have no other object than to secure, in explicit terms, some of the essential rights and privileges of freemen. It may be of dangerous consequence to refuse desires so reasonable. If the constitution should pass at all, I hope it will be in such a way as may encrease the unity of the states and the harmony of our citizens, and that we be not a house divided against itself."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,3/18/1788,"(Continued from No. 357.) Thus it was that the opposite qualities of the first confederation were rather caused by than the cause of two parties, which from its first existence began and have continued their operations, I believe, unknown to their country and almost unknown to themselves—as really but few men have the capacity or resolution, to develope the secret causes, which influence their daily conduct.—The old Congress was a national government and an union of States, both brought into one [389]political body, as these opposite powers, I do not mean parties, were so exactly blended and very nearly balanced, like every artificial, operative machine where action is equal to re-action—it stood perfectly still—it would not move at all—Those who were merely confœderal in their views, were for dividing the public debt—those who were for national government, were for encreasing of it—Those who thought any national government would be destructive to the liberties of America, as I imagine, assisted those who thought it our only safety, to put every thing as wrong as possible.—Requisitions were made, which every body knew it was impossible to comply with—either in 82 or 83, ten millions of hard dollars, if not thirteen, were called into the continental treasury, when there could not be half that sum in the whole tract of territory between Nova-Scotia and Florida—The States neglected them in despair2—The public honor was tarnished, and our governments abused by their servants and best friends—In fine, it became a cant word—things are not yet bad enough to mend—However, as great part of the important objects of society were entrusted to this mongrel species of general government, the sentiment of pushing it forward became general throughout America, and the late Convention met at Philadelphia under the uniform impression, that such was the desire of their constituents—But even then the advantages and disadvantages of national government operated so strongly, although silently, on each individual, that the conflict was nearly equal—A third or middle opinion, which always arises in such cases, broke off and took the lead—the national party assisted, pursued steadily their object—the fœderal party dropt off, one by one, and finally, when the middle party came to view the offspring which they had given birth to, and in a great measure reared, several of them immediately disowned the child—Such has been hitherto the progress of party, or rather of the human mind dispassionately contemplating our separate and relative situation, and aiming at that perfect completion of social happiness and grandeur, which perhaps can be combined only in idea—Every description of men entertain the same wishes (excepting perhaps a few very bad men of each)—they forever will differ about the mode of accomplishment—and some must be permitted to doubt the practi[ca]bility. As our citizens are now apprized of the progress of parties or political opinions on the continent, it is fit they should also be informed of the present state, force and designs of each, in order that they may form their decisions with safety to the public and themselves—this shall be given with all the precision and impartiality the author is capable of. America is at present divided into three classes or descriptions of men, and in a few years there will be but two. The first class comprehends all those men of fortune and reputation who stepped forward in the late revolution, from opposition to the administration, rather than the government of Great-Britain—All those aristocrats whose pride disdains equal law—Many men of very large fortune, who entertain real or imaginary fears for the security of property—Those young men, who have sacrificed their time and their talents to public service, without any prospect of an adequate pecuniary or honorary reward—All your people of fashion and pleasure who are corrupted by the dissipation of the French, English and American armies; and a love of European manners and luxury—The public creditors of the continent, whose interest has been heretofore sacrificed by their friends, in order to retain their services on this occasion—A large majority of the mercantile people, which is at present a very unformed and consequently dangerous interest—Our old native merchants have been almost universally ruined by the receipt of their debts in paper during the war, and the payment in hard money of what they owed their British correspondents since peace—Those who are not bankrupts, have generally retired and given place to a set of young men, who conducting themselves as rashly as ignorantly, have embarrassed their affairs and lay the blame on the government, and who are really unacquainted with the true mercantile interest of the country—which is perplexed from circumstances rather temporary than permanent—The foreign merchants are generally not to be trusted with influence in our government—they are most of them birds of passage—some perhaps British emissaries encreasing and rejoicing in our political mistakes, and even those who have settled among us with an intention to fix themselves and their posterity in our soil, have brought with them more foreign prejudices, than wealth—time must elapse before the mercantile interest will be so organized as to govern themselves, much less others, with propriety: And lastly, to this class I suppose we may ultimately add the tory interest with the exception of very many respectable characters, who reflect with a gratification mixed with disdain, that those principles are now become fashionable for which they have been persecuted and hunted down—which, although by no means so formidable as is generally imagined, is still considerable—They are at present wavering—they are generally, though with very many exceptions, openly for the proposed, but secretly against any American government—A burnt child dreads the fire—but should they see any fair prospect of confusion arise, these gentry will be off at any moment for these five and twenty years to come—Ultimately should the administration promise stability to the new government, they may be counted on as the Janizaries of power, ready to efface all suspicion by the violence of [391]their zeal—In general, all these various people would prefer a government, as nearly copied after that of Great-Britain, as our circumstances will permit—some would strain these circumstances—others still retain a deep rooted jealousy of the executive branch and strong republican prejudices as they are called—finally, this class contains more aggregate wisdom and moral virtue than both the other two together—it commands nearly two-thirds of the property and almost one half the numbers of America, and has at present, become almost irresistible from the name of the truly great and amiable man who it has been said, is disposed to patronize it, and from the influence which it has over the second class—This class is nearly at the height of their power, they must decline or moderate, or another revolution will ensue, for the opinion of America is becoming daily more unfavorable to those radical changes which high-toned government requires:—A conflict would terminate in the destruction of this class, or the liberties of their country—May the Guardian Angel of America prevent both! The second class is composed of those descriptions of men who are certainly more numerous with us than in any other part of the globe—First, those men who are so wise as to discover that their ancestors and indeed all the rest of mankind were and are fools. We have a vast over proportion of these great men, who, when you tell them that from the earliest period at which mankind devoted their attention to social happiness, it has been their uniform judgment, that a government over governments cannot exist—that is two governments operating on the same individual—assume the smile of confidence and tell you of two people travelling the same road—of a perfect and precise division of the duties of the individual: Still however, the political apothegm is as old as the proverb—That no man can serve two masters,3 and whoever will run their noddles against old proverbs will be sure to break them, however hard they may be, and if they broke only their own, all would be right; but it is very horrible to reflect that all our numskulls must be cracked in concert.—Second—The trimmers who from sympathetic indecision are always united with, and when not regularly employed, always fight under the banners of these great men. These people are forever at market and when parties are nearly equally divided, they get very well paid for their services. Thirdly—The indolent, that is almost every second man of independent fortune you meet with in America—these are quite easy, and can live under any government. If men can be said to live, who scarcely breathe, and if breathing was attended with any bodily exertion, would give up their small portion of life in despair. These men do not swim with the stream as the trimmers do, but are dragged like mud at the bottom. As they have no other weight than [392]their fat flesh, they are hardly worth mentioning when we speak of the sentiments and opinions of America. As this second class never can include any of the yeomanry of the union, who never affect superior wisdom, and can have no interest but the public good, it can be only said to exist at the birth of government, and as soon as the first and third classes become more decided in their views, this will divide with each and dissipate like a mist, or sink down into what are called moderate men, and become the tools and instruments of others. These people are prevented by a cloud from having any view; and if they are not virtuous, they at least preserve the appearance which in this world amounts to the same thing. At the head of the third class appear the old rigid republicans, who although few in number, are still formidable—Reverence will follow these men in spite of detraction, as long as wisdom and virtue are esteemed among mankind—they are joined by the true democrats, who are in general fanatics and enthusiasts, and some few sensible, charming madmen—a decided majority of the yeomanry of America will, for a length of years, be ready to support these two descriptions of men; but as this last class is forced to act as a residuary legatee, and receive all the trash and filth—it is in some measure disgraced and its influence weakened, by 3dly. The free-booters and plunderers, who infest all countries and ours perhaps as little as any other whatever—these men have that natural antipathy to any kind or sort of government, that a rogue has to a halter. In number they are few indeed—such characters are the offspring of dissipation and want, and there is not that country in the world where so much real property is shared so equally among so few citizens, or where property is as easily acquired by fair means, very few indeed will resort to foul. Lastly, by the poor mob, infelix pecus! the property of whoever will feed them and take care of them—let them be spared—let the burthen of taxation sit lightly on their shoulders, but alas! this is not their fate—it is here that government forever falls with all its weight—it is here that the proposed government will press where it should scarcely be felt.— Oves [custos] bis mulget in hora, et succus pecori et lac subducitur agnis.4 If ever a direct tax is laid by the general government, it must, if not from necessity, at least from propriety, be laid on polls—it is the only one I believe to be practicable—there ought then to be some security that they avoid direct taxation where not absolutely indispensible, and some better security than the opinion of Aristides. In this class may be counted men of the greatest mental powers and of as sublime virtue as any in America—they at present command nearly one-third of the property and above half the numbers of the United States, and in either event they must continue to encrease in influence by great desertions from both the other classes.—If the government is adopted, by the numerous, discontented and disappointed, and from that natural jealousy, which Englishmen and their descendants always will retain, of their government and Governors. If the government is not adopted theirs will be the prevalent opinion. The object of this class either is or will be purely federal—an union of independent States, not a government of individuals: And should the proposed federal plan fail, from the obstinacy of those who will listen to no conditional amendments, although such as they cannot disapprove; or should it ultimately in its execution upon a fair trial, disappoint the wishes and expectations of our country: An union purely federal is what the reasonable and dispationate patriots of America must bend their views to. My countrymen, preserve your jealousy—reject suspicion, it is the fiend that destroys public and private happiness. I know some weak, but very few if any wicked men in public confidence; and learn this most difficult and necessary lesson:—That on the preservation of parties, public liberty depends. Whenever men are unanimous on great public questions, whenever there is but one party, freedom ceases and despotism commences. The object of a free and wise people should be so to balance parties, that from the weakness of all you may be governed by the moderation of the combined judgments of the whole, not tyranized over by the blind passions of a few individuals."
Newspaper,No,A Represent-or not -ative,,Maryland Gazette,,3/18/1788,"Mr. Hayes, By giving the underneath a place in your useful paper, you will oblige a constant reader. Hints for a Political Print. To exhibit fully and conspicuously the numerous characters that constitute our Public Councils, Conventions, Senates, Assemblies, &c. would [394]be a task too difficult even for the pencil of a Raphael, or Angelo; nor could the pericranium of any one man, contain so many ideas, as would suffice for the numerous subjects, that upon an impartial enquiry, would naturally present themselves. To select a few of those, which at present seems to engross the attention of the public, is the business of the following plan: Any gentleman, inclined to pursue the design, is left at liberty, to make what alterations, or additions, he may think proper, as I would not be understood, to claim any merit in the execution; and indeed I think blind chance has done more than the warmest fancy could have imagined, in bringing together such a group of figures, as I believe scarce ever appeared on canvass before. Let the principal figure, or rather figures, in this design, be the respectable members that formed the late Convention, mounted upon a lofty carriage, with thirteen wheels, representing the American States, constructed after the manner of those in Ezekiel, “A wheel within a wheel,”2 to denote the union as something mysterious; some of the spokes may appear broken, to express the imperfect system of our Government. Let several of the members be in an attitude of the most profound study, intent upon poring over pieces of paper, representing the old C—t-t-t—n;3 whilst others are in the posture of an Orator in the Roman Senate, declaiming with all the powers of language, and leading some by a long harrangue passing in a direct line through their noddles, in the manner of a [– – –], to a writing desk, to sign their names to a piece of parchment, inscribed with the words “New Federal Constitution,” they gazing all the while they are writing, mouth and eyes upon the Orators; and their faces making a right angle with the line of direction, from the Speaker’s mouth to the backside of their heads, and thence proceeding round them in the form of a spiral curve, till it enclose them from head to foot, with the end of it brought up to their mouths, which must be in the attitude of gulping it in, and vending some of the periods out afresh to others of the opposite party, who are canvassing their serpentine casement, and making their objections against such and such parts of it as appear to them inconsistent. These last may be represented in any attitude, provided they are each of them chewing the end of a period, to this or some such purpose, “The rights of freemen are not secured. It is the indispensible duty of every Patriot to oppose such measures. We cannot thus sacrifice the liberties of our Constituents,” &c. and amongst them may be placed Caution without Foresight, a motley figure half military, scarce civil, trembling like a shaking Q——r at the sight of a zealous member of the other side, tearing in pieces the old Constitution, who may be represented with a small head and a huge full-bottomed wig, that covers [395]three parts of his body, to denote him a man of consequence. Be careful that the leading ones of both sides have a ministerial air, with a tolerable degree of authority, and self importance impressed upon their countenances. The aforesaid carriage is to be represented as having no tongue or shafts, by which it may be drawn but the wheels placed in such a manner, that it may be pulled either way, with a sufficient number of men, at each wheel pulling in different directions: Some of them with a label out of their mouths to this effect, “Do you know what this means?” Having all the time their eyes fixed upon themselves and pulling with all their might, whatever way the croud around them may direct; whilst one is whispering on one side their heads, “This is the paladium of the liberties of America,” and another on the other side, “Let us unite to pull down this throne of a——t——cy.” Others standing at a distance and viewing the scene make their conjectures, by shrugging their shoulders and shaking their heads, like an Usurer at lawful interest; some, half expressing their approbation, by having their eyes and one leg advanced towards the carriage, while others are passing and repassing in different directions, to appearance altogether careless which side has the better, being invariably determined to pursue the example of the bats in the fable, to join whichever side may prove the strongest.4 It would not be amiss to represent some of the Demons, that disturb the public peace, as hovering over the croud, with Discord at their head, having a firebrand in one hand, and a dagger in the other: The Genius of America, endeavouring to expel them thence, exhibited as having displayed in one hand, a piece of paper with the word UNITE, and with the other pointing to the illustrious Washington, as a pattern of imitation to every well-wisher of the community.—So much for what may be called the grand design of the piece—others, less particular, may be placed as convenience admits, for instance, we may have a sketch of the P——t of the S——e, with a sufficient number of the Acts of As——y piled up behind him, and the word reversed wrote in capital letters upon the back of each of them; and out of his mouth a compliment A la Tilbury,5 h—— and d—— blast you all. Perhaps it would not be amiss to give his E——ll——y the air of f——g at the A——ts aforementioned; we may also have the portrait of a S——r and As——y—n, each having the end of a rope in their hands, whilst a slip-knot in the middle, may really strangle three-fourths of the p——le. Several other characters are omitted, which I leave to the luxurious fancy of the Artist. If there are any vacancies on the canvass, they may be filled up with fixtures or still life, such for instance as a free and independent elector [396]of B——e C——y [Baltimore County], with a ticket stuck upon the globe of his eye, and a label upon his mouth, “No, Sir, I’m of t’other side, Sir,”—how I lament that sounds cannot be conveyed to the eye. These are figures which if possible are to come forward towards the front of the piece; as to the back ground it may be shadowed over, with a sufficient number of our modern writers on politics, etched or rather itched out to the life; some grasping a pen, others a news-paper in one hand, with the other rivetted in their respective posteriors; writers on Divinity, Law, or Physick, are apt to scratch their foreheads in the agony of composition, to set the subsided ideas in a fermentation; but our late writers of the other class, if I mistake not the true spirit and force of their productions, look for the seat of inspiration in a much lower place, which, whilst the furor is upon them, they lacerate without mercy, and by the delectable friction, their imaginations become as prurient as their b——k——s, and the latter is relieved from one kind of matter, whilst their brains are supplied with another—in short, every thing they write seems to be polished ad unguem6—The genuine use or real influence, of their compositions, may be very well denoted, by a lunatic, brandishing a crutch, or bawling through a grate, or a Caledonian in the time of the late war, writing with desperate charcoal, a letter to North-America. I presume these few observations may suffice to give sketch enough of the design, to which may be added a great many more, equally as deserving of the public attention; but as I at first promised only to select a few, I leave the plan to be improved, or altered, as the undertaker may think proper."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/18/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. To you, my fellow-citizens, I hold myself in a particular manner accountable for every part of my conduct in the exercise of a trust reposed in me by you, and should consider myself highly culpable if I was to withhold from you any information in my possession, the knowledge of which may be material to enable you to form a right judgment on questions wherein the happiness of yourselves and your posterity are involved—Nor shall I ever consider it an act of condescension when impeached in my public conduct, or character, to vindicate myself at your bar, and to submit myself to your decision. In conformity to these sentiments, which have regulated my conduct since my return from the Convention, and which will be the rule of my actions in the sequel, I shall, at this time, beg your indulgence, while I make some observations on a Publication which the Landholder has done me the honour to address to me, in the Maryland Journal, of the 29th of February last. In my controversy with that writer, on the subject of Mr. Gerry, I have already enabled you to decide, without difficulty, on the credit which ought to be given to his most positive assertions, and should scarce think it worth my time to notice his charges against myself, was it not for the opportunity it affords me of stating certain facts and transactions, of which you ought to be informed, some of which were undesignedly omitted by me when I had the honour of being called before the House of Delegates.1 No “extreme modesty” on my part was requisite to induce me to conceal the “sacrifice of resentments” against Mr. Gerry—since no [398]such sacrifice had ever been made—nor had any such resentments ever existed—The principal opposition in sentiment between Mr. Gerry and myself, was on the subject of representation; but even on that subject, he was much more conceding than his colleagues, two of whom obstinately persisted in voting against the equality of representation in the Senate, when the question was taken in Convention upon the adoption of the conciliatory propositions, on the fate of which depended, I believe, the continuance of the Convention.2 In many important questions we perfectly harmonized in opinion, and where we differed, it never was attended with warmth or animosity, nor did it in any respect interfere with a friendly intercourse, and interchange of attention and civilities.—We both opposed the extraordinary powers over the militia, given to the general government3—we were both against the re-eligibility of the president4—we both concurred in the attempt to prevent members of each branch of the legislature from being appointable to offices,5 and in many other instances, although the Landholder, with his usual regard to truth, and his usual imposing effrontery, tells me, that I “doubtless must remember Mr. Gerry and myself never voted alike, except in the instances” he has mentioned. As little foundation is there in his assertion, that I “cautioned certain members to be on their guard against his wiles, for that he and Mr. Mason held private meetings, where the plans were concerted to aggrandize, at the expence of the small States, old Massachusetts and the ancient dominion.” I need only state facts to refute the assertion. Some time in the month of August, a number of members who considered the system, as then under consideration, and likely to be adopted, extremely exceptionable, and of a tendency to destroy the rights and liberties of the United States, thought it advisable to meet together in the evenings, in order to have a communication of sentiments, and to concert a plan of conventional opposition to, and amendment of that system, so as, if possible, to render it less dangerous. Mr. Gerry was the first who proposed this measure to me, and that before any meeting had taken place, and wished we might assemble at my lodgings; but not having a room convenient, we fixed upon another place—There Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason did hold meetings; but with them also met the Delegates from New-Jersey and Connecticut, a part of the delegation from Delaware, an honourable member from South-Carolina, one other from Georgia, and myself—These were the only “private meetings” that ever I knew or heard to be held by Mr. Gerry and Mr. Mason—meetings at which I myself attended until I left the Convention—and of which the sole object was not to aggrandize the great at the expence of the small, but to protect and preserve, if possible, the existence and essential rights of all the States, and the liberty and freedom [399]of their citizens.6 Thus, my fellow-citizens, I am obliged, unless I could accept the compliment at an expence of truth equal to the Landholder’s, to give up all claim to being “placed beyond the reach of ordinary panegyrick,” and to that “magnanimity” which he was so solicitous to bestow upon me, that he has wandered the regions of falsehood to seek the occasion. When we find such disregard of truth even in the introduction, while only on the threshold, we may form some judgment what respect is to be paid to the information he shall give us of what passed in the Convention, when he “draws aside the veil”—a veil which was interposed between our proceedings and the Public, in my opinion, for the most dangerous of purposes, and which was never designed by the advocates of the system to be drawn aside, or if ever, not till it should be too late for any beneficial purpose7—which as far as it is done or pretended to be done, on the present occasion, is only for the purpose of deception and misrepresentation. It was on Saturday8 that I first took my seat—I obtained that day a copy of the propositions that had been laid before the Convention, and which were then the subject of discussion in a committee of the whole.9 The secretary was so polite as, at my request, to wait upon me at the State-House the next day (being Sunday) and there gave me an opportunity of examining the journals, and making myself acquainted with the little that had been done before my arrival—I was not a little surprised at the system brought forward, and was solicitous to learn the reasons which had been assigned in its support; for this purpose the journals could be of no service, I therefore conversed on the subject with different members of the Convention, and was favoured with minutes of the debates, which had taken place before my arrival—I applied to history for what lights it could afford me—and I procured every thing the most valuable I could find in Philadelphia, on the subject of governments in general, and on the American revolution and governments in particular10—I devoted my whole time and attention to the business in which we were engaged, and made use of all the opportunities I had, and abilities I possessed, conscientiously to decide what part I ought to adopt in the discharge of that sacred duty I owed to my country, in the exercise of the trust you had reposed in me—I attended the Convention many days without taking any share in the debates, listening in silence to the eloquence of others, and offering no other proof that I possessed the powers of speech, than giving my yea or nay when a question was taken, and notwithstanding my propensity to “endless garrulity,” should have been extremely happy if I could have continued that line of conduct, without making a sacrifice of your rights and political happiness. The committee of the whole house had made but small progress, at the time I arrived, in the discussion of the propositions which had been referred to them; they completed that discussion, and made their report—The propositions of the minority were then brought forward and rejected11—The Convention had resumed the report of the committee, and had employed some days in its consideration—Thirty days,12 I believe, or more, had elapsed from my taking my seat before, in the language of the Landholder, I “opened in a speech which held during two days”.13—Such, my fellow-citizens, is the true state of the conduct I pursued when I took my seat in Convention, and which the Landholder, to whom falshood appears more familiar than truth, with his usual effrontery, has misrepresented by a positive declaration, that without obtaining, or endeavouring to obtain, any information on the subject, I hastily and insolently obtruded my sentiments on the Convention, and, to the astonishment of every member present, on the very day I took my seat, began a speech, which continued two days, in opposition to those measures, which, on mature deliberation, had been adopted by the Convention. But I “alone advocated the political heresy, that the people ought not to be trusted with the election of representatives.” On this subject, as I would wish to be on every other, my fellow-citizens, I have been perfectly explicit in the information I gave to the House of Delegates, and which has since been published.14—In a state government, I consider all power flowing immediately from the people in their individual capacity, and that the people, in their individual capacity, have, and ever ought to have, the right of choosing delegates in a state legislature; the business of which is to make laws, regulating their concerns, as individuals, and operating upon them as such; but, in a federal government, formed over free states, the power flows from the people, and the right of choosing delegates belongs to them only mediately through their respective state governments, which are the members composing the federal government, and from whom all its power immediately proceeds; to which state governments, the choice of the federal delegates immediately belongs.—I should blush, indeed, for my ignorance of the first elements of government, was I to entertain different sentiments on this subject; and if this is “political heresy,” I have no ambition to be ranked with those who are orthodox.—Let me here, my fellow-citizens, by way of caution, add an observation, which will prove to be founded in truth—those who are the most liberal in complimenting you with powers which do not belong to you, act commonly from improper and interested motives, and most generally have in view thereby to prepare the way for depriving you of those rights to which you are [401]justly entitled.—Every thing that weakens and impairs the bands of legitimate authority, smooths the road of ambition; nor can there be a surer method of supporting and preserving the just rights of the people, than by supporting and protecting the just rights of Government. As to the “jargon” attributed to me of maintaining [“]that notwithstanding each state had an equal number of votes in the Senate, yet the states were unequally represented in the Senate,” the Landholder has all the merit of its absurdity; nor can I conceive what sentiment it is that I ever have expressed, to which he, with his usual perversion and misrepresentation, could give such a colouring. That I ever suggested the idea of letting loose an army indiscriminately on the innocent and guilty, in a state refusing to comply with the requisitions of Congress, or that such an idea ever had place in my mind, is a falsehood so groundless, so base and malignant, that it could only have originated or been devised by a heart which would dishonour the midnight assassin. My sentiments on this subject are well known; it was only in the case where a state refused to comply with the requisitions of Congress, that I was willing to grant the general government those powers which the proposed constitution gives it in every case.(a)15—Had I been a greater friend to a standing army, and not quite so averse to exposing your liberties to a soldiery, I do not believe the Landholder would have chose me for the object on whom to expend his artillery of falsehood. That a system may enable government wantonly to exercise power over the militia, to call out an unreasonable number from any particular state without its permission, and to march them upon, and continue them in, remote and improper services—that the same system should enable the government totally to discard, render useless, and even disarm the militia, when it would remove them out of the way of opposing its ambitious views, is by no means inconsistent, and is really the case in the proposed constitution:—In both these respects it is, in my opinion, highly faulty, and ought to be amended. In the proposed system, the general government has a power not only without the consent, but contrary to the will of the state government, to call out the whole of its militia, without regard to religious scruples, or any other consideration, and to continue them in service as long as it pleases, thereby subjecting the freemen of a whole state to martial law, and reducing them to the situation of slaves.—It has also, by another clause, the powers, by which only the militia can be organized and armed, and by the neglect of which they may be rendered utterly useless and insignificant, when it suits the ambitious purposes of government:—Nor is the suggestion unreasonable, even if it had been made, that the government [402]might improperly oppress and harrass the militia, the better to reconcile them to the idea of regular troops, who might relieve them from the burthen, and to render them less opposed to the measures it might be disposed to adopt for the purpose of reducing them to that state of insignificancy and uselessness. When the Landholder declared that “I contended the powers and authorities of the new constitution must destroy the liberties of the people,” he, for once, stumbled on the truth; but even this he could not avoid coupling with an assertion utterly false. I never suggested that “the same powers could be safely entrusted to the old Congress;”—on the contrary, I opposed many of the powers as being of that nature that, in my opinion, they could not be entrusted to any government whatever, consistent with the freedom of the states and their citizens; and earnestly recommended, what I wish, my fellow-citizens, deeply to impress on your minds, that in altering or amending our federal government, no greater powers ought to be given than experience has shewn to be necessary, since it will be easy to delegate further power when time shall dictate the expediency or necessity; but powers once bestowed upon a government, should they be found ever so dangerous or destructive to freedom, cannot be resumed or wrested from government, but by another revolution. Baltimore, March 14, 1788. (a) According to this idea, I endeavoured to obtain as an amendment to the system, the following clause: “And whenever the legislature of the United States shall find it necessary that revenue shall be raised by direct taxation, having apportioned the same by the above rule, requisitions shall be made of the respective states to pay into the continental treasury their respective quotas, within a time in the said requisition to be specified; and in case of any of the states failing to comply with such requisition, then, and then only, to have power to devise and pass acts directing the mode, and authorizing the same in the state failing therein.”—This was rejected, and that power, which I wished to have given the government only in this particular instance, is given to it, without any restraint or limitation, in every case."
Newspaper,No,Manco,,Maryland Journal,,3/18/1788,"It is the established creed of America, that the Liberty of the Press is the Palladium of all the civil, political and religious rights of Americans2—The News-Papers are the best vehicles of intelligence and information, respecting public affairs, to the people at large; and to stop [404]their free circulation, is an act of injury and insult to the citizens of these United States. At no time can it be more necessary to keep open the channels of communication than at the present moment. The great motive for erecting the present Post-Office in America, was to promote the public good, by facilitating a constant and speedy conveyance of public despatches and private letters; and the incidental revenue arising from the latter, was but a secondary object. The mutual exchange of News-Papers by the Printers on this continent, in the mail, was always exercised under the British government, and continued since the revolution, until a few weeks ago, when Ebenezer Hazard, Esq; Post-Master-General, prohibited the sending any News-Papers in the mail.3—What must be the feelings of every Freeman in America, on the conduct of this little despot in office?—Take the alarm all the Lovers of Freedom—it is a sample of what you may expect, if the new system of national government should be adopted.4—The first symptom of a design on the liberties of America is the shackling of the Press; the second is the cutting off the communication of sentiment in the News-Papers.—If the people submit to this conduct, nothing can rouse them from their lethargy, and their next sleep will be the sleep of Death—the loss of their liberties. Baltimore, March 17, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,3/21/1788,"I have said that the boasted birthright of Englishmen and their posterity—the trial by jury in civil cases, is destroyed under the proposed federal constitution; that the hope of its re-establishment by the future Congress is at best doubtful; that its tenure, depending on the fluctuating breath of annual or biennial sessions, is uncertain; and finally, I denied the power of reviving it by a Congressional law at all, as it would be a violation of the constitution:—It may be expected that in a cause like this, assertion and proof should go hand in hand. It has ever been contended, at least on one side, that the proposed Congress are to exercise no power not expressly vested in them by the federal plan. This is the position of Aristides, and of all the friends of the system.—It is now asked, is the power of establishing juries in civil cases by Congress, given in that constitution? It must be answered no, not at least in express words.—Is it then given by implication? If so great an authority can be taken from the judges, the judiciary, an independent branch of government, by the legislature, and vested in a distinct branch, a jury, I do not see in what judiciary independence consists.—Can these judicial powers, vested in the judges, by the constitution, which gives them the cognizance of certain causes, be divested by an implied legislative power? If we imply this power, may we not imply any other? And does not the doctrine of implication totally defeat the fundamental position of Aristides, and the friends of the new government? But moreover does not Aristides, and every lawyer, know that in the interpretation of all political as well as civil laws, this fundamental maxim must be observed, That where there are two objects in contemplation of any legislature, the express adoption of one, is the total exclusion of the other; and that the adoption of juries in criminal cases, in every legal interpretation, amounts to an absolute rejection in civil cases:—If the right of establishing juries, by a Congressional law is admitted at all, it must be admitted, as an inherent legislative right, paramount to the constitution, as it is not derived from it, and then the power that can make, can by law unmake; so that referring this power to a source of authority superior to the act of government, would leave us without any juries at all (even in criminal cases) if Congress should so please; which position can never be the object of either friends or enemies to the system at present.—If it is [409]defective, it is still bad policy to make it worse; but still in every view, we must reflect, that the establishment of trials by jury, belongs to political, not to civil legislation. It includes the right of organizing government, not of regulating the conduct of individuals, as the following enquiry will prove; we must never give an assembly the power of giving itself power. As the worth and excellence of this mode of trial, preserved and handed down from generation to generation for near two thousand years, has drawn down the enthusiastic encomiums of the most enlightened lawyers and statesmen of every age; as it has taken deep root in the breast of every freeman, encompassed by the defences of affection and veneration, a repetition of its praises would be as tedious as useless: Some remarks however, still remain to be made, which will place this subject in a more important and conspicuous view. The trial by jury, is the only remaining power which the Commons of England have retained in their own hands, of all that plenitude of authority and freedom, which rendered their northern progenitors irresistible in war, and flourishing in peace.—The usurpations of the few, gradually effected by artifice and force, have robbed the many, of that power which once formed the basis of those governments, so celebrated by mankind.—The government of Sparta, the form of which, it is said, has continued from the days of Lycurgus to our age, preserving its model amidst those overwhelming tides of revolution and ship-wrecks of governments, which Greece has sustained for near three thousand years; the same form of government among the Saxons and other Germans, consisting of King, Lords and Commons, applauded by Tacitus and Machiavelli, were thus distinguished from the present government of England—The power of the Commons resided with them, not in representatives but in the body of the people.—De minoribus rebus, principes consultant; de majoribus omnes, are either the words of Tacitus or Cæsar.2 The administration of ordinary affairs was committed to the select men; but all important subjects were deliberated on by the whole body of the people.—Such was the constitution of Sparta, and of England, when Machiavelli gives them as a model, for there can be no doubt but that the folk-motes of the Saxons were not formed by representation—The venerable remembrance of which assemblies, hung long about the affections of Englishmen, and it was to restore them that they offered such frequent libations of their noblest blood; but the usurpations of the few have been unwearied and irresistible, and the trial by jury is all that now remains to the many. The trial by jury is—the democratic branch of the judiciary power—more necessary than representatives in the legislature; for those usurpations, which silently undermine the spirit of liberty, under the sanction of [410]law, are more dangerous than direct and open legislative attacks; in the one case the treason is never discovered until liberty, and with it the power of defence is lost; the other is an open summons to arms, and then if the people will not defend their rights, they do not deserve to enjoy them. The judiciary power, has generally been considered as a branch of the executive, because these two powers, have been so frequently united;—but where united, there is no liberty.—In every free State, the judiciary is kept separate, independent, and considered as an intermediate power;—and it certainly partakes more of a legislative, than an executive nature—The sound definition which Delolme applied to one branch may be justly extended to the whole judiciary,—That it is a subordinate legislation in most instances, supplying by analogy, and precedent in each particular case, the defects of general legislative acts,3—without then the check of the democratic branch—the jury, to ascertain those facts, to which the judge is to apply the law, and even in many cases to determine the cause by a general verdict—the latitude of judicial power, combined with the various and uncertain nature of evidence, will render it impossible to convict a judge of corruption, and ascertain his guilt.—Remove the fear of punishment, give hopes of impunity, and vice and tyranny come scowling from their dark abodes in the human heart.—Destroy juries and every thing is prostrated to judges, who may easily disguise law, by suppressing and varying fact:—Whenever therefore the trial by juries has been abolished, the liberties of the people were soon lost—The judiciary power is immediately absorbed, or placed under the direction of the executive, as example teaches in most of the States of Europe.—So formidable an engine of power, defended only by the gown and the robe, is soon seized and engrossed by the power that weilds the sword.—Thus we find the judiciary and executive branches united, or the former totally dependant on the latter in most of the governments in the world.—It is true, where the judges will put on the sword and weild it with success, they will subject both princes and legislature to their despotism, as was the case in the memorable usurpation of the Justizia of Arragon, where the judiciary erected themselves into a frightful tyranny. Why then shall we risque this important check to judiciary usurpation, provided by the wisdom of antiquity? Why shall we rob the Commons of the only remaining power they have been able to preserve, for their personal exercise? Have they ever abused it?—I know it has and will be said—they have—that they are too ignorant—that they cannot distinguish between right and wrong—that decisions on property are submitted to chance; and that the last word, commonly determines the cause:—There is some truth in these allegations—but whence [411]comes it—The Commons are much degraded in the powers of the mind:—They were deprived of the use of understanding, when they were robbed of the power of employing it.—Men no longer cultivate, what is no longer useful;—should every opportunity be taken away, of exercising their reason, you will reduce them to that state of mental baseness, in which they appear in nine-tenths of this globe—distinguished from brutes, only by form and the articulation of sound—Give them power and they will find understanding to use it—But taking juries with all their real and attributed defects, is it not better to submit a cause to an impartial tribunal, who would at least, as soon do you right as wrong—than for every man to become subservient to government and those in power?—Would any man oppose government, where his property would be wholly at the mercy and decision of those that govern?—We know the influence that property has over the minds of men—they will risque their lives rather than their property; and a government, where there is no trial by jury, has an unlimited command over every man who has any thing to loose.—It is by the attacks on private property through the judiciary, that despotism becomes as irresistible as terrible. I could relate numerous examples of the greatest and best men in all countries, who have been driven to despair, by vexatious law-suits, commenced at the instigation of the court, of favorites and of minions, and all from the loss of juries.—France was reduced to the brink of destruction in one instance.—The Queen mother Louise of Savoy, piqued at the constable of Bourbon, a young and amiable man, who refused to marry her, commenced a suit against him for all his estate—The judges were ready at the beck of the court, and without a shadow of justice deprived him by law of every shilling he was worth; and drove from his country an unfortunate hero, whose mad revenge carried desolation into her bosom.—In Denmark a despicable minion, who came in rags to the court, after the establishment of their new government, which they solicited Frederick the IIId to make for them, acquired an immense fortune by plunder, sheltered by the favour of the Sovereign. At last he fixed his eyes on a most delightful estate, and offered to buy it—The owner did not want money, and could not think of selling the patrimony of an ancient family; this wretch then spirited up law-suits against him, and after the most cruel vexations obliged him to sell the estate for much less than he at first offered him. This unfortunate gentleman was driven from the country which gave him birth, and a once happy society of relations and friends.—Such would have been the fate of England, from those courts without juries, which took cognizance of causes arising in the revenues and imports in Charles the first’s time, the court fortunately for the liberties of England, seized the bull by the horns, when they attacked that wonderful [412]man John Hampden. He spent 20,000l. rather than pay an illegal tax of twenty shillings, brought the cause before the Parliament, roused the spirit of the nation, and finally overturned courts, King, and even the constitution for many years. These dreadful examples may teach us the importance of juries in civil cases—they may recal to my countrymen a maxim which their ancestors, as wise, and more virtuous than their posterity, held ever in view—That if the people creep like tortoises, they will still find themselves too fast in giving away power."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/21/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. In the recognition which the Landholder professes to make “of what occurred to my advantage,” he equally deals in the arts of misrepresentation, as while he was “only the record of the bad,” and I am equally obliged, from a regard to truth, to disclaim his pretended approbation as his avowed censure. He declares, that I originated the clause which enacts, that “this Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or the laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.” To place this matter in a proper point of view, it will be necessary to state, that as the propositions were reported by the committee of the whole house, a power was given to the general government to negative the laws passed by the state legislatures—a power [414]which I considered as totally inadmissible;—in substitution of this, I proposed the following clause, which you will find very materially different from the clause adopted by the Constitution, “that the legislative acts of the United States, made by virtue and in pursuance of the articles of the union, and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the respective states, so far as those acts or treaties shall relate to the said states, or their citizens; and that the judiciaries of the several states shall be bound thereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws of the individual states to the contrary notwithstanding.”1 When this clause was introduced, it was not established that inferior continental courts should be appointed for trial of all questions arising on treaties and on the laws of the general government,2 and it was my wish and hope that every question of that kind would have been determined, in the first instance, in the courts of the respective states; had this been the case, the propriety and the necessity that treaties duly made and ratified, and the laws of the general government should be binding on the state judiciaries, which were to decide upon them, must be evident to every capacity, while, at the same time, if such treaties or laws were inconsistent with our constitution and bill of rights, the judiciaries of this state would be bound to reject the first and abide by the last; since in the form I introduced the clause, notwithstanding treaties and the laws of the general government were intended to be superior to the laws of our state government, where they should be opposed to each other, yet that they were not proposed, nor meant to be superior to our constitution and bill of rights. It was afterwards altered and amended (if it can be called an amendment) to the form in which it stands in the system now published,3 and, as inferior continental, and not state, courts are originally to decide on those questions, it is now worse than useless; for being so altered as to render the treaties and laws made under the general government superior to our constitution, if the system is adopted, it will amount to a total and unconditional surrender to that government, by the citizens of this state, of every right and privilege secured to them by our constitution, and an express compact and stipulation with the general government, that it may, at its discretion, make laws in direct violation of those rights: But on this subject I shall enlarge in a future number.4 That I “voted an appeal should lay to the supreme judiciary of the United States, for the correction of all errors both in law and fact,” in rendering judgment, is most true; and it is equally true that if it had been so ordained by the Constitution, the supreme judiciary would only have had an appellate jurisdiction, of the same nature with that possessed by our high court of appeals,5 and could not in any respect intermeddle [415]with any fact decided by a jury; but as the clause now stands, an appeal being given in general terms from the inferior courts, both as to law and fact, it not only doth, but was avowedly intended to give a power very different from what our court of appeals, or any court of appeals in the United States or in England enjoys—a power of the most dangerous and alarming nature, that of setting at nought the verdict of a jury, and having the same facts which they had determined, without any regard or respect to their determination, examined and ultimately decided by the judges themselves; and that by judges immediately appointed by the government. But the Landholder also says, that “I agreed to the clause that declares nine states to be sufficient to put the government in motion.”— I cannot take to myself the merit even of this, without too great a sacrifice of truth.— It was proposed that if seven states agreed, that should be sufficient;—by a rule of convention in filling up blanks, if different numbers were mentioned, the question was always to be taken on the highest: It was my opinion, that to agree upon a ratification of the constitution by any less number than the whole thirteen states, is so directly repugnant to our present articles of confederation, and the mode therein prescribed for their alteration, and such a violation of the compact which the states, in the most solemn manner, have entered into with each other, that those who could advocate a contrary proposition, ought never to be confided in and entrusted in public life6—I availed myself of this rule, and had the question taken on thirteen, which was rejected—Twelve, eleven, ten and nine were proposed in succession; the last was adopted by a majority of the members—I voted successively for each of these numbers, to prevent a less number being agreed on—Had nine not been adopted, I should on the same principle have voted for eight: But so far was I from giving my approbation that the assent of a less number of states than thirteen should be sufficient to put the government in motion, that I most explicitly expressed my sentiments to the contrary, and always intended, had I been present when the ultimate vote was taken on the constitution, to have given it my decided negative, accompanied with a solem[n] protest against it, assigning this reason among others for my dissent. Thus, my fellow-citizens, that candour with which I have conducted myself through the whole of this business, obliges me, however reluctantly, and however “mortifying it may be to my vanity” to disavow all “those greater positive virtues” which the Landholder has so obligingly attributed to me in Convention, and which he was so desirous of conferring upon me as to consider the guilt of misrepresentation and falsehood but a trifling sacrifice for that purpose, and to increase my mortification, you will find I am equally compelled [416]to yield up every pretence, even to those of a negative nature, which a regard to justice has, as he says, obliged him not to omit.—These consist, as he tells us, in giving my entire approbation to the system, as to those parts which are said to endanger a trial by jury, and as to its want of a bill of rights, and in having too much candour there to signify that I thought it deficient in either of these respects:—But how, I pray can the Landholder be certain that I deserve this encomium? Is it not possible, as I so frequently exhausted the politeness of the Convention, that some of those marks of fatigue and disgust, with which he intimates I was mortified as oft as I attempted to speak, might, at that time, have taken place, and have been of such a nature as to attract his attention;—or, perhaps, as the Convention was prepared to slumber whenever I rose, the Landholder, among others, might have sunk into sleep, and at that very moment might have been feasting his imagination with the completion of his ambitious views, and dreams of future greatness:—But supposing I never did declare in Convention, that I thought the system defective in those essential points, will it amount to a positive proof that I approved the system in those respects, or that I culpably neglected an indispensable duty? Is it not possible, whatever might have been my insolence and assurance when I first took my seat, and however fond I might be at that time of obtruding my sentiments, that the many rebuffs with which I met—the repeated mortifications I experienced—the marks of fatigue and disgust with which my eyes were sure to be assailed wherever I turned them—one gaping here—another yawning there—a third slumbering in this place—and a fourth snoring in that—might so effectually have put to flight all my original arrogance, that, as we are apt to run into extremes, having at length become convinced of my comparative nothingness, in so august an assembly, and one in which the science of government was so perfectly understood, I might sink into such a state of modesty and diffidence, as not to be able to muster up resolution enough to break the seal of silence and open my lips, even after the rays of light had begun to penetrate my understanding, and in some measure to chase away those clouds of error and ignorance, in which it was enveloped on my first arrival.—Perhaps, had I been treated with a more forbearing indulgence while committing those memorable blunders, for want of a sufficient knowledge in the science of Government, I might, after the rays of light had illuminated my mind, have rendered my country much more important services, and not only assisted in raising some of the pillars, but have furnished the edifice with a new roof of my own construction, rather better calculated for the convenience and security of those who might wish to take shelter beneath it, than that which it at [417]present enjoys.—Or even admitting I was not mortified, as I certainly ought to have been, from the Landholder’s account of the matter, into a total loss of speech, was it in me, who considered the system, for a variety of reasons, absolutely inconsistent with your political welfare and happiness, a culpable neglect of duty in not endeavouring, and that against every chance of success, to remove one or two defects, when I had before ineffectually endeavoured to clear it of the others, which, therefore, I knew must remain. But to be serious; as to what relates to the appellate jurisdiction in the extent given by the system proposed, I am positive there were objections made to it, and as far as my memory will serve me, I think I was in the number of those who actually objected; but I am sure that the objections met with my approbation.7 With respect to a bill of rights—Had the government been formed upon principles truly federal, as I wished it, legislating over and acting upon the states only in their collective or political capacity, and not on individuals, there would have been no need of a bill of rights, as far as related to the rights of individuals, but only as to the rights of states:—But the proposed constitution being intended and empowered to act not only on states, but also immediately on individuals, it renders a recognition and a stipulation in favour of the rights both of states and of men, not only proper, but in my opinion, absolutely necessary.—I endeavoured to obtain a restraint on the powers of the general government, as to standing armies, but it was rejected.8 It was my wish that the general government should not have the power of suspending the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus, as it appears to me altogether unnecessary, and that the power given to it, may and will be used as a dangerous engine of oppression; but I could not succeed.9 An honourable member from South-Carolina, most anxiously sought to have a clause inserted, securing the Liberty of the Press, and repeatedly brought this subject before the Convention, but could not obtain it.10—I am almost positive he made the same attempt to have a stipulation in favour of Liberty of Conscience, but in vain.11—The more the system advanced, the more was I impressed with the necessity of not merely attempting to secure a few rights, but of digesting and forming a complete bill of rights, including those of states and of individuals, which should be assented to, and prefixed to the constitution, to serve as a barrier between the general government and the respective states and their citizens; because the more the system advanced, the more clearly it appeared to me that the framers of it did not consider that either states or men had any rights at all, or that they meant to secure the enjoyment of any to either the one or the other; accordingly, I [418]devoted a part of my time to the actually preparing and draughting such a bill of rights, and had it in readiness before I left the Convention, to have laid it before a committee.—I conversed with several members on the subject; they agreed with me on the propriety of the measure, but, at the same time, expressed their sentiments that it would be impossible to procure its adoption if attempted.—A very few days before I left the Convention, I shewed to an honourable member sitting by me, a proposition, which I then had in my hand, couched in the following words, “Resolved, that a committee be appointed to prepare and report a bill of rights, to be prefixed to the proposed constitution,” and I then would instantly have moved for the appointment of a committee for that purpose, if he would have agreed to second the motion, to do which he hesitated, not as I understood from any objection to the measure, but from a conviction in his own mind, that the motion would be in vain.12 Thus, my fellow-citizens, you see that so far from having no objections to the system on this account, while I was at Convention, I not only then thought a bill of rights necessary, but I took some pains to have the subject brought forward, which would have been done, had it not been for the difficulties I have stated:—At the same time I declare, that when I drew up the motion, and was about to have proposed it to the Convention, I had not the most distant hope it would meet with success.—The rejection of the clauses attempted in favour of particular rights, and to check and restrain the dangerous and exorbitant powers of the general government from being abused, had sufficiently taught me what to expect:—And from the best judgment I could form while in Convention, I then was, and yet remain, decidedly of the opinion, that ambition and interest had so far blinded the understanding of some of the principal framers of the constitution, that while they were labouring to erect a fabrick by which they themselves might be exalted and benefited, they were rendered insensible to the sacrifice of the freedom and happiness of the states and their citizens, which must, inevitably, be the consequence.—I most sacredly believe their object is the total abolition and destruction of all state governments, and the erection, on their ruins, of one great and extensive empire, calculated to aggrandize and elevate its rulers and chief officers, far above the common herd of mankind—to enrich them with wealth, and to encircle them with honours and glory—and which, according to my judgment, on the maturest reflection, must, inevitably, be attended with the most humiliating and abject slavery of their fellow-citizens, by the sweat of whose brows, and by the toil of whose bodies, it can only be effected:—And so anxious were its zealous promoters to hasten to a birth [419]this misshapen, heterogeneous monster of ambition and interest, that, for some time before the Convention rose, upon the least attempt to alter its form, or modify its powers, the most fretful impatience was shewn, such as would not have done much honour to a state assembly, had they been sitting as long a time, and their treasury empty; while it was repeatedly urged on the contrary, but urged in vain, that in so momentous an undertaking, in forming a system for such an extensive continent, on which the political happiness of so many millions, even to the latest ages, may depend, no time could be too long—no thought and reflection too great—and that if by continuing six months, or even as many years, we could free the system from all its errors and defects, it would be the best use to which we could possibly devote our time. Thus, my fellow-citizens, am I under the necessity of resigning again into the hands of the Landholder, all those virtues both of a positive and negative kind, which, from an excess of goodness, he bestowed upon me, and give him my full permission to dispose of them hereafter in favour of some other person, who may be more deserving, and to whom they will be more acceptable; at the same time, I must frankly acknowledge, however it may operate as a proof of my dullness and stupidity, that the “ignorance in the science of government” under which I laboured at first, was not removed by more than two months close application, under those august and enlightened masters of the science, with which the Convention abounded, nor was I able to discover during that time, either by my own researches, or by any light borrowed from those luminaries, any thing in the history of mankind, or in the sentiments of those who have favoured the world with their ideas on government, to warrant or countenance the motley mixture of a system proposed; a system which is an innovation in government of the most extraordinary kind;—a system neither wholly federal, nor wholly national—but a strange hotch-potch of both—just so much federal in appearance as to give its advocates, in some measure, an opportunity of passing it as such upon the unsuspecting multitude, before they had time and opportunity to examine it, and yet so predominantly national, as to put it in the power of its movers, whenever the machine shall be set agoing, to strike out every part that has the appearance of being federal, and to render it wholly and entirely a national government:—And if the framing and approving the constitution now offered to our acceptance, is a proof of knowledge in the science of government, I not only admit, but I glory in my ignorance; and if my rising to speak had such a somnific influence on the Convention as the Landholder represents, I have no doubt the time will come, should this system be adopted, when my countrymen will ardently wish I had never [420]left the Convention, but remained there to the last, daily administering to my associates, the salutary opiate. Happy, thrice happy, would it have been for my country, if the whole of that time had been devoted to sleep, or been a blank in our lives, rather than employed in forging its chains! As I fully intended to have returned to the Convention before the completion of its business, my colleagues very probably might, and were certainly well warranted to, give that information the Landholder mentions; but whether the Convention was led to conclude that I “would have honoured the constitution with my signature, had not indispensable business called me away,” may be easily determined after stating a few facts.—The Landholder admits I was at first against the system.—When the compromise took place on the subject of representation, I in the most explicit manner declared in Convention, that though I had concurred in the report, so far as to consent to proceed upon it, that we might see what kind of a system might be formed, yet I disclaimed every idea of being bound to give it my assent, but reserved to myself the full liberty of finally giving it my negative, if it appeared to me inconsistent with the happiness of my country.—In a desultory conversation, which long after took place in Convention, one morning before our honourable president13 took the chair, he was observing how unhappy it would be should there be such a diversity of sentiment as to cause any of the members to oppose the system when they returned to their states;—on that occasion I replied, that I was confident no state in the union would more readily accede to a proper system of government than Maryland, but that the system under consideration was of such a nature, that I never could recommend it for acceptance;—that I thought the state never ought to adopt it, and expressed my firm belief that it never would. An honourable member from Pennsylvania, objected against that part of the sixth article which requires an oath to be taken by the persons there mentioned, in support of the constitution, observing (as he justly might from the conduct the convention was then pursuing) how little such oaths were regarded:14 I immediately joined in the objection, but declared my reason to be, that I thought it such a constitution as no friend of his country ought to bind himself to support.—And not more than two days before I left Philadelphia, another honourable member from the same state, urged most strenuously that the convention ought to hasten their deliberations to a conclusion, assigning as a reason, that the assembly of Pennsylvania was just then about to meet, and that it would be of the greatest importance to bring the system before that session of the legislature, in order that a convention of the state might be [421]immediately called to ratify it, before the enemies of the system should have an opportunity of making the people acquainted with their objections, at the same time declaring that if the matter should be delayed, and the people have time to hear the variety of objections which would be made to it by its opposers, he thought it doubtful whether that state, or any state in the union, would adopt it.(a) As soon as the honourable member took his seat, I rose and observed, that I was precisely of the same opinion, that the people of America never would, nor did I think they ought to, adopt the system, if they had time to consider and understand it, whereas a proneness for novelty and change—a conviction that some alteration was necessary, and a confidence in the members who composed the Convention might possibly procure its adoption, if brought hastily before them—but that these sentiments induced me to wish that a very different line of conduct should be pursued from that recommended by the honourable member—I wished the people to have every opportunity of information, as I thought it much preferable that a bad system should be rejected at first, than hastily adopted, and afterwards be unavailingly repented of. If these were instances of my “high approbation,” I gave them in abundance, as all the Convention can testify, and continued so to do till I left them.15— That I expressed great regret at being obliged to leave Philadelphia, and a fixed determination to return, if possible, before the Convention rose, is certain—That I might declare that I had rather lose an hundred guineas than not to be there at the close of the business is very probable—and it is possible that some who heard me say this, not knowing my reasons, which could not be expressed without a breach of that secrecy to which we were enjoined, might erroneously have concluded that my motive was the gratification of vanity, in having my name enrolled with those of a Franklin and a Washington. As to the first, I cordially join in the tribute of praise so justly paid to the enlightened philosopher and statesman, while the polite friendly and affectionate treatment myself and my family received from that venerable sage, and the worthy family in which he is embosomed, will ever endear him to my heart—The name of Washington is far above my praise!—Would to Heaven that, on this occasion, one more wreath had been added to the number of those which are twined around his amiable brow!—that those with which it is already surrounded, may flourish with immortal verdure, nor wither or fade till time shall be no more, is my fervent prayer! and may that glory which encircles his head, ever shine with undiminished rays! To find myself under the necessity of opposing such illustrious characters, whom I venerated and loved, filled me with regret, but viewing [422]the system in the light I then did, and yet do view it, to have hesitated would have been criminal; complaisance would have been guilt. If it was the idea of my State, that whatever a Washington or Franklin approved, was to be blindly adopted, she ought to have spared herself the expence of sending any members to the Convention, or to have instructed them implicitly to follow where they led the way. It was not to have my “name enrolled with the other labourers,” that I wished to return to Philadelphia—that sacrifice which I must have made of my principles by putting my name to the constitution, could not have been effaced by any derivative lustre it could possibly receive from the bright constellation with which it would have been surrounded.—My object was, in truth, the very reverse, as I had uniformly opposed the system in its progress, I wished to have been present at the conclusion, to have then given it my solemn negative, which I certainly should have done, even had I stood single and alone, being perfectly willing to leave it to the cool and impartial investigation both of the present and of future ages to decide who best understood the science of government—who best knew the rights of men and of states—who best consulted the true interest of America, and who most faithfully discharged the trust reposed in them, those who agreed to, or those who opposed, the new Constitution—and so fully have I made up my own mind on this subject, that as long as the history of mankind shall record the appointment of the late Convention, and the system which has been proposed by them, it is my highest ambition that my name may be also recorded as one who considered the system injurious to my country, and as such opposed it. Having shewn that I did not “alter my opinion after I left Philadelphia,” and that I acted no “contradictory parts on the great political stage,” and, therefore, that there are none such to reconcile, the reason assigned by the Landholder for that purpose, doth not deserve my notice, except only to observe, that he shrewdly intimates there is already a junto established, who are to share in, and deal out the offices of this new government at their will and pleasure, and that they have already fixed upon the character who is to be “Deputy Attorney-General of the United States for the State of Maryland.” If this is true, it is worth while to inquire of whom this junto consists, as it might lead to a discovery of the persons, for the gratification of whose ambition and interest this system is prepared, and is, if possible, to be enforced; and from the disposition of offices already allotted in the various and numerous departments, we possibly might discover whence proceeds the conviction and zeal of some of its advocates. Baltimore, March 19, 1788. (a) How exactly agreeable to the sentiments of that honourable member has been the conduct of the friends of the constitution in Pennsylvania and some other states, I need not mention.16"
Newspaper,No,H.Z.,,Maryland Journal,,3/21/1788,"Mr. William Goddard, Sir, We are informed by a gentleman from your place, that a complete system of government for the United States, has been drawn up by the Honourable Luther Martin, and is intended to be published in your Paper—As the time appointed for the meeting of the Convention draws near, it must be of great importance to the community, to have this work published as speedily as possible, in order that the people at large may have time to consider it with that attention which the nature of the subject requires, and after careful examination, and comparing with the system proposed by the late national Convention, they may have time calmly to judge for themselves, which of the two is most likely to secure their liberty, and promote their happiness. Should the publication of this new system be delayed, the people will in all probability conclude, that the constitution proposed by the late Convention, is the best that can be contrived, for say they, if any good man knew of a better, he surely would, in love to his country, publish it. It is not sufficient that the defects of the proposed plan of government have been pointed out, for the people know, that every system framed by men, will be imperfect—but if they can have the two systems laid before them, a fair opportunity then arises of choosing the best, or that which is least defective. I persuade myself this work will meet no delay in your hands, and am, Sir, your humble servant, Harford County, March 15, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,3/25/1788,"I have been long since firmly persuaded, that there are no hidden sources of moral agency beyond the reach of investigation.—The all-wise and all-bountiful Author of Nature, could never have created human reason unequal to the happy regulation of human conduct.—The errors and misfortunes of mankind spring from obvious sources. Religious and political prejudices, formed by education, strengthened by habit, maintained by interest, and consecrated by fear, are forever arming the passions against the judgment.—The celebrated Blaise Pascal (the powers of whose understanding were rather miraculous than surprizing) closed his painful researches after religious truth, with this dogma, as pernicious as untrue,—“That a religion purely spiritual, was never intended for mankind.”2 There could be no judgment more unbiassed, for there was no mind so strong, no heart more pure; but bred in the bosom of the church, even her idolatry impressed him with veneration and awe. Notwithstanding his conclusion, the doctrines of Calvin maintain their ground in their primitive simplicity, divested of the aid of ceremony and form. The thunders of the Vatican, which for ages deluged Europe with blood, have dissipated their force, and reason has resumed her spiritual empire. Would to God, that the history of temporal despotism had terminated as favourably for the happiness of mankind!—In the political world, the chains of civil power, upheld by the numerous links of private interest, have proved more equal and permanent in their effects, they have, and I fear forever must, shackle the human understanding; and it is much to be questioned whether the full and free political opinion of any one great luminary of science, has been fairly disclosed to the world—Even when the great and amiable Montesquieu had hazarded a panegyric on the English constitution, he shrinks back with terror into this degrading apostrophe—“Think not that I mean to undervalue other governments—I who think an excess of liberty an excess of all things, even of reason itself, a misfortune, and that the happiness of mankind is only to be found in a medium between two [432]extremes.”3—The author of the Persian letters, at that moment recollected the afflicting presure he had felt from the hand of Gallic government, and his pen trembled as he wrote. Is it then possible that governments of simplicity and equal right, can have been fairly dealt by in theory or practice? The votaries of tyranny and usurpation stand not alone—in bitter opposition; every man of enterprize, of superior talents and fortune, is interested to debase them; their banners have ever been deserted because they never can pay their troops.—The most amiable and sensible of mankind seem to have made a stand in favour of a mixed government founded on the permanent orders and objects of men.—Thither I suspect the American government is now tending. If it must be so—Let it go gently then—with slow and equal steps.—Let each gradation and experiment have a full and fair trial—Let there be no effect without a good, apparent and well considered cause—Let us live all the days of our lives, and as happily as circumstances will permit.—Finally, let moderation be our guide and the influence of manners will conduct us (I hope without injury) to some permanent, fixed establishment, where we may repose a while, unagitated by alteration or revolution—For in sudden and violent changes, how many of the most worthy of our fellow-citizens must get their bones crushed? I cannot think that any able and virtuous citizen, would in his cool and dispationate moments, wish to blend or risque the fundamental rights of men, with any organization of society that the Americans can or will make for fifty years to come.—Let us keep these rights of individuals—these unalienable blessings reserved and separated from every constitution and form—If they are unmingled, the attentive eyes of every citizen will be kept fixed upon them. We shall watch them as a sacred deposit, and [we?] may carry them uninjured and unimpaired through every vicissitude and change, from the government we have left, into some other that may be established on the fixed and solid principles of reason—Nor can there be, I imagine, any prudent man, who would trust the whimsical inventions of the day, with that dangerous weapon a standing army, in our present unsettled circumstances—striving to substantiate inefficient and unnatural forms—it would wield us into despotism in a moment, and we have surely had throat-cutting enough in our day. Throughout the world government by representation, seems only to have been established to disgrace itself and be abolished—its very principle is change, and it sets all systems at defiance—it perishes by speedy corruption.—The few representatives can always corrupt themselves by [433]legislative speculations, from the pockets of their numerous constituents—quick rotation, like a succession of term tenants on a farm, only encreases the evil by rendering them more rapacious: If the executive is changeable, he can never oppose large decided majorities of influential individuals—or enforce on those powerful men, who may render his next election abortive, the rigor of equal law, which is the grand and only object of human society.—If the executive is to be rendered ineligible at a certain period, he will either not do his duty, or he will retire into the unprotected situation of a private individual, with all the sworn animosities of a powerful majority—aristocracy—junto—the cry of the populace, or perhaps the whole combined to pursue him to the grave, or a public execution. The considerate and good, who adorn private life, and such only can be safely trusted in high public station, will never commit themselves to a situation where a consciencious discharge of duty may embitter the evening of life, if not draw down ruin and infamy on themselves and families.—There never was but one man who stepped from the top to the bottom, without breaking his neck, and that was Sylla; and although it is true that whilst he was up, he broke the hearts of the Romans, yet his dying undisturbed in private life, is one of those miracles that must remain forever unexplained. If the aristocracy, or representation of wealth, (the principle of which order is to keep all things as they are, for by confusion they may lose more than they can gain) is also changeable, there then is nothing fixed and permanent in government.—Legislative tyranny commences, and exhibits a perpetual scene of plunder and confusion, fearlessly practised under the sanction of authority and law. It is true that the influence of manners may and will resist for a time; yet that must give way to a general and prevalent corruption—Those who are respectable at home and have permanent views in life, and such only can give stability to government, will not suffer themselves to be mounted up on the wheel of fortune, to be let down again as it turns, the mockery of children and fools.—Where representation has been admitted as a component part of government, it has always proved defective, if not destructive. What then must be the consequence where the whole government is founded on representation? Every American can now answer, it will be at best but—representation of government—with us the influence of manners has been great—it is indeed declining fast; but aided by the solidity of the judiciary establishments, and the wisest code of civil laws, that ever mankind were blessed with, it has hitherto supported the forms of society: But the people are now weary of their representatives and their governments.—We may trace the progress.—One candidate, to recommend his pretensions, discloses and descants on the errors of the preceding administration—The people believe him and are deceived—they [434]change men; but measures are still the same, or injured by the sudden and violent alteration of system—At least the next candidate asserts it is so—is again believed, and his constituents again deceived; a general disgust and sullen silence ensue; elections are deserted; government is first despised, and then cordially hated. There can be no fixed and permanent government that does not rest on the fixed and permanent orders and objects of mankind.—Government on paper may amuse, but we pay dear for the amusement, the only fixed and permanent order with us at present are the yeomanry, and they have no power whatever,—unless the right of changing masters at a certain period, and devolving on their changeable representatives their whole political existence—may be called power—The order of gentry, with us, is not a fixed and permanent order at all, and if they attempt to erect themselves into one at present, it is usurpation, and they will be pulled down; and yet, in my opinion, such an order is essential to a perfect government, founded on representation.—Every other mode of introducing wealth into power, has proved vicious and abominable.—With us delegates become by selection, themselves a species of subaltern aristocracy—they intrigue with the senates, who by a refined mode of election are a misbegotten, side blow, representation of wealth, and they both form an imperfect aristocracy, on the worst principles on which that order can be admitted into government—and the democratic influence which is thus amalgomated and not divided, but unformed becomes vicious from its impotence. These defects spring from our attempting to erect republican fabrics on the ruined and imperfect pillars of an old corrupt monarchy—not less absurd, than to expect the limbs to perform the functions of life, after cutting off the head.—The opposition which brought Charles the first to the block, was composed of some of the ablest and most virtuous characters that ever adorned any age or clime—Hampden, Pym, Selden, Sir Harry Vane, Sydney, Marvell and many others.—They pursued their old model—attempted to form a government by representation which was at first steadied and restrained by the best senate in the world, (the English House of Lords)—the two houses soon disagreed, and there being no third power to interpose, the representatives, voted the House of Lords useless—new modelled the government into a single branch, and then began to plunder most unmercifully—At last Cromwell kicked them all out of doors, and after his tyrannical usurpation and death, the nation were very happy to take shelter again under the regal government, and even restored an unworthy family (which they had irritated beyond forgiveness) to the throne. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Neckar,,Maryland Gazette,,3/25/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. I am not deeply versed in politics, nor do I understand much of what are called the secret springs of government. Necessary occurrences in life have taught me, that pence, accumulated make shillings; and shillings in the same mode amount to pounds:—That as it is the duty of individuals to acquit their obligations to each other, so it is equally the duty of a State to discharge her obligations to her sister States. I have been led into this reflection from considering the delinquency of several of the States in paying their quotas of the requisitions made to them by Congress, for the support of the Union, and payment of our foreign and domestic debts, and the operation of the proposed new constitution, should it be adopted. Agreeable to the powers vested in Congress by the confederation, the States have been regularly apprised of their several proportions or quotas, necessary to discharge the public claims; attended with requisitions to them to make suitable provisions for paying the same into the public treasury. Some of the States have seriously attended to the requisitions, and pretend to have fully complied with them: Others, have paid considerable sums; and several have contributed little or nothing; and of course are considerably in arrears.2 By the proposed new constitution every State without regard to local situation is in the collection of revenue to be placed on an equal footing—That is to say, that all money collected by mode of impost, or direct taxation, the latter of which is to be the same in every State, is to be paid into the public treasury, and there become an aggregate fund destined to general governmental purposes. The State of Maryland, if not of the number which has fully paid, is on a respectable footing at least; and has ever been considered for her attention to Congress requisitions, and faithful application of the sums levied for those purposes.3 Every citizen who has paid his taxes has contributed to the good reputation of the State—has discharged his duty as a member of the Union, and is entitled to exact the same compliance from every other. In many instances the persons, though well disposed to pay, have from disappointments, and the evils flowing from a peace suddenly negotiated, been unable to do it—in consequence of which their property has been seized under execution, and sold at most for one half the value, which it would have commanded under other circumstances—This part of the community having severely suffered for their non-compliance to pay taxes have, upon every equitable principle of impartial justice, a right to demand and to expect a like coercion on every delinquent member of the Union. Many citizens of some States, whose influence pervaded even their Legislatures, have sought every subterfuge to avoid paying their proportions of the general expence, and trusted to future events to relieve themselves entirely from them. A change of government did not escape the calculation of those hawk-eyed delinquents, and has been looked up to as the spunge of their iniquity—But shall those men triumph in their wickedness? Forbid it justice and every tie of honour, requisite to the Union of our extensive empire! Whether the necessary regulations to guard against the evils which may result from the conduct alluded to, should have flowed from the convention which formed the new constitution; or whether the subject was ever attended to by that body I am unable to say? It however strikes me as a subject requiring the serious deliberation of the different State conventions, and particularly that of Maryland—That the general one, as it is called, has not made provision for a collection of the deficiencies due from the several States; but that it has effectually precluded the making any by them, or the new Congress, will evidently appear from an attentive perusal of the constitution; by which the power of laying and collecting all taxes is assumed, and a provision that no one State shall be subject to any other than the general regulations—I confess the subject appears of such importance, that I hardly can believe it to [446]have escaped the attention of many of the members of the convention—and if it did not, much satisfaction might be given to the public by knowing the motives for not proceeding upon it. If business of such magnitude did escape their notice, I then contend it is a strong argument why the State conventions should not be confined in their deliberations on the new constitution; and that they should particularly attend to every provision requisite to the placing all citizens on an equal footing; whether by amendment or otherwise. Should the arrears due from the several States pass unnoticed, great injustice will be done to that part of the community, which has in fact been the only support of government to this hour, and consequently many of the pence, shillings and pounds, of orderly citizens, must be drawn from their pockets, to pacify, and silence men of speculation, without principle; who when they shall by their want of good conduct, have again reduced the States they reside in to a situation similar with their present, will as readily join in oversetting the proposed constitution, as they have been forward in promoting it—flattering themselves to escape with impunity. Some questions may with propriety be asked should the arrearages be unattended to—Where the taxes have been rated, part levied, part not, is the collection of the part unpaid to be pursued? If collected how is it to be applied? To be paid into the continental treasury, to make up the deficient sum of the quota of the State paying it; or are the several States to hold the money thus raised at their own disposal? Unless every State is bound to pay up her quota, no particular one will conceive herself bound to do it—But the collection will involve another question—The civil power of a State and that of the United States must not clash. In a case of insolvency which shall have the preference? But should a State have neglected, previous to the adoption of the new constitution, making any arrangement for complying with the requisitions of the former Congress, by what means, if so disposed, is she to make provision afterwards? The new constitution, as already said, assumes all powers of taxation, and consequently in the above case cuts off those of retributive-justice—It follows of consequence, that the refractory and unprincipled part of the community, are encouraged to become as unworthy members under the new, as they were under the old government. We are told by some, that many of the powers of taxation, granted by the new constitution, will not be put in motion, because all ways and means of supplies may be found in that of an impost and others directly issuing from it, such as an excise, &c.—That therefore direct taxation will cease; and the farmer and planter again enjoy halcyon days! It would have afforded me, and doubtless many others, much satisfaction, had writers discovered to the public the principles of the calculations, on which such assertions are founded. I conceive differently of the business—Every State whose local situation can admit of it, has adopted an impost; and in the opinion of many who are well informed of the nature of our coasts, to as great an extent as can be, without encouragement to smuggling, and an excessive increase of officers. Some have also laid an excise—The revenues arising from this impost and excise, no matter the sum, have been expended either for State, or continental purposes; and superadded to them heavy direct taxes on the inhabitants and their property—Those States whose local situation will not admit of an impost, have adopted an excise, tax on property, [– – –], &c. The income of which has likewise been applied as above, and in some instances proved inefficient; as in New-Jersey. If such is the true state of things, as I believe it, I would wish to be informed how under the new constitution, we in Maryland, are to be relieved from direct taxation? On the contrary, will not our taxes be encreased? In the States not permitting an impost—direct taxation is to cease, until the revenues arising from an impost shall be found insufficient for the general purposes.—It then follows, that these revenues of an impost must be equal in means, not only to the objects they are at present applied to; but also embrace the amount of those at present raised by direct taxation; which are to cease. And consequently those States whose situation will not admit of an impost will, as far as that collected will apply, be absolutely exempted from contributing to the general expences—for the fact is, that they consume very little of imported goods; and that it is only by direct taxation, any thing considerable can be drawn from them. From what source is such an encrease in the revenues of our impost to take its rise? The idea strikes me as chimerical, and strongly so, when I consider that it is the business of the Legislatures to infuse into their citizens a spirit of frugality,4 and abstaining from foreign luxuries; and I therefore conclude that direct taxation will be necessary in addition to an impost. These taxes must be equal throughout the States.—What will then be the comparative situation of those having an impost with those who have none? The taxes of the former must be encreased in proportion to the sum previously relinquished by the latter—But if arrearages already due are unattended to, then must our direct taxes be still farther encreased to make up those deficiencies; and not only our pence, but shillings and pounds will be wanting for the purpose. It may be argued that a sacrifice is encumbent on us—That unanimity alone will prove our strength and guardian.—It is an axiom I will [448]not dispute—no one more ardently desires union; or would more cheerfully sacrifice to the attainment of it—But all who expect, or wish a sacrifice on the occasion, can only ask it as to future connections—the engagements of the past ought to be religiously fulfilled. Party-spirit may alledge from the foregoing suggestions, that the writer of them is opposed to the new constitution, or as it is now said, though improperly, antifœderal.—Every person is free in the enjoyment of opinion, and I shall not by any declarations of mine, attempt to biass that of others—Suffice it to say, that I wish the good of my country, and provided there be an impartial administration of justice, am indifferent as to the men or measures—If I have erred in the statement made, no doubt many are ready to correct it, and I shall with pleasure submit to better judgment—But until sufficient proofs are adduced against my conclusions, I flatter myself the subject will be attentively considered; and that all who interest themselves in the election of members for the State convention, will not suppose the business of it confined to a mere approbation of, or dissent from, a particular measure.—The persons proper for the occasion are those who will be inclined to listen to the voice of reason; who if amendments or particular provisions, should on discussion be found necessary, will steadily persevere to obtain them; and if superfluous, will cheerfully submit to that which may promote the general weal—That particular provisions are necessary cannot I think be doubted. The case stated is a proof:—But attend to this—Every stipulation should be previous to adoption; or like the good people of Massachusetts, we may first concede our rights, and then humbly crave a partial restoration.5 March 15, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,3/28/1788,"After every consideration I can give this subject, I am satisfied, that government founded on representation, indispensibly requires, at least an [449]executive for life, whose person must be sacred from impeachment, and only his ostensible ministers responsible—A senate for life, the vacancies to be filled up and the number occasionally encreased but under a limitation, by the executive—the hand that holds the balance must have the power of adding weight and influence to the lightest scale, and of frequently removing turbulent men into an higher and inoffensive situation:—I am inclined to think that an important portion of American opinion leans that way at this moment—My fear is, that our general government may ultimate in an hereditary authority—if not despotism—to avoid the former, great attention should be paid to the important office of Vice-President—at present but little understood:—A Vice-President to succeed on a vacancy prevents those evils which have ruined Poland and all the northern kingdoms—thus we see the King of the Romans has secured Germany from every evil of elective monarchy, and had the golden bull prevented one of the family or kindred of the reigning Emperor from filling the office of the King of the Romans, this part of the Germanic constitution would have been perfect, and the house of Austria would never have been enabled to usurp the imperial crown as a patrimony and desolate Europe with her ambitious views; she would have continued in that beggarly condition from which Rodolph of Hapsburg raised it—The American constitution is much better guarded but not by any means completely so. If this is the best we can hope for—if this is the best reward we can expect for the sons of America slain, and the distresses we shall long continue to feel—is it not incumbent on us to examine minutely all its consequences?—Let us view government by representation in its favorite form—The constitution of England—its uncommon success and length of duration there, has drawn on it very unmerited encomiums from the enlightened Genevan Delolme—the only great political writer who does not seem to hold representation in contempt,2—indeed the viewing it through this favorable medium has always animated our hopes, and led many sensible Americans to imagine, this old and universal experiment, to be peculiar to that isle—In pursuing my inquiry into the principles and effects of the British government, I shall first grant that it is a rational system, founded on solid, safe principles—and one of the best governments for the higher ranks of mankind in the world—but then I must insist that it was hardly a government at all, until it became simplified by the introduction and regular formation of the effective administration of responsible ministers, on its present system—which we cannot date higher up, than the appointment of Lord Stratford and others by Charles 1st(a)—Moreover I do not know how far the system of bribery introduced by Sir Robert Walpole, and the influence of the numerous body of public creditors, are not now absolutely necessary [450]to its present stability—and after all, I am not satisfied how such a simplification as would produce a responsibility, can be effected in a government, complicated by so many subordinate and powerful corporations as the American States will be—and yet responsibility must be attained and an easy and certain mode adopted, of changing measures and men without commotion, or liberty will be lost in the attempt—I am confused and bewildered when I arrive at this point of reflection, and despotism meets me at every turn.—There are but two modes of governing mankind, by just and equal law, enforced impartially on all ranks of society, or by the sword:—If such laws cannot be obtained, or the attainment is attended with too much difficulty, the sword will supply their place; et inter arma leges silent. When arms command the laws are disobeyed. Shall we have patience, with the disorders of our complicated machine? As Alexander dissolved the gordian knot with the sword—so I fear a standing army will simplify the governments of America.—I have said that the government of England afforded firm protection to property—it certainly does so, comparatively speaking—yet the history of its frequent revolutions, will discover that even property is insecure there. During the civil wars, in which the Stuarts involved this nation, two-thirds of the property of the kingdom changed masters; and in those between Lancaster and York, and before the firm establishment of the line of Tuder, almost all the old families perished and their property became dissipated:—And yet its protection of property is its favorable side; turn your eyes to the lower order of citizens, and they are pressed into the earth by taxation and imposition—very rarely will industry enable the husbandman to rear a family—where the sons of agriculture are so poorly rewarded, government must be ulcerated to the heart—the miserable poor who pursue the dictates of nature and religion, in that connection which is destined to sweeten the bitter draught of life, are commonly handed from constable to constable, until their unfortunate birth compels some parish to own them.—The people of England have always and forever will emigrate—The people of England never repair to arms to repel foreign invasion—and they never will unless compelled—to conquer England, it would only seem necessary from past example, to escape their floating defences and land on the island; passing by former invasions and conquests. As late as the year 1745, Prince Charles Edward, at the head of an undisciplined rabble, belonging to some Highland clans attached to his family, marched undisturbed, through the most populous counties into the heart of the kingdom, and the capital containing 200,000 fighting men trembled for its safety at the approach of an unexperienced boy, followed by 4 or 5000 half armed peasants—scarcely a man [451]in the kingdom shouldered a musquet until the danger disappeared, and government owed its safety to the protection of foreign mercenaries, or rather the weakness and irresolution of the assailant—The fact is, the people will never fight (if they can help it) for representatives, taxes and rags. Let us now contrast this scene with one, where the people personally exercise the powers of government—The three small democratic Cantons of Uri, Schuitz and Underwald, broke the chains of their former servitude, and laid the foundation of the Swiss confederacy—they effected the revolution, and in conjunction with the other democratic Cantons and their democratic allies the Grisons, have supported the grand fabric of Helvetic liberty to this day. Every Swiss farmer is by birth a legislator, and he becomes a voluntary soldier to defend his power and his property; their fathers have been so before them for near 500 years, without revolution, and almost without commotion—they have been the secure spectators of the constant and universal destruction of the human species, which the usurpations of the few have ever created, and must I fear forever perpetuate:—Whilst all Europe were butchering each other for the love of God, and defending the usurpations of the clergy, under the masque of religion, the malignant evil crept into this sacred asylum of liberty; (but where the government resides in the body of the people, they can never be corrupted by the artifice or the wealth of the few) they soon banished the demon of discord, and Protestant and Papist sat down under the peaceful shade of the same tree, whilst in every surrounding State and kingdom, the son was dragging the father, and brothers, their brothers, to the scaffold, under the sanction of those distinctions:—Thus these happy Helvetians have in peace and security beheld all the rest of Europe become a common slaughter-house.—A free Swiss acquires from his infancy, a knowledge of the fundamental laws of his country, and the leading principles of their national policy are handed down by tradition from father to son—the first of these is never to trust power to representatives, or a national government. A free Swiss pays no taxes, on the contrary he receives taxes; every male of 16 years, shares near ten shillings sterling annually, which the rich and powerful surrounding monarchies pay for the friendship of these manly farmers. Whenever their societies become too large, as government belongs to the citizens and the citizens are the property of no government, they divide amicably, and each separate part pursues the simple form, recommended by their ancestors and become venerable, by the glorious and happy experience of ages of prosperity—Their frugal establishments are chiefly supported by the pay which the officers of government receive for the services [452]they render individuals. With a country the most unfriendly to industry in the world, they have become in a series of years, passed in uninterrupted but moderate labor, frugality, peace and happiness, the richest nation under the sun. I have seen a computation, by which it appeared, that the interest of the money they have before hand, and that which is due them from the rich nations of Europe, would support themselves and their posterity forever, without farther exertion; and this whilst every other government is actually as much or more in debt than it is worth. An intelligent author has remarked, that passing from a democratic to an aristocratic Canton of Swisserland, you quit the society of men to contemplate the regular labor of brutes; they are compelled indeed in the aristocratic Cantons to be extremely moderate in their government, and to lay few or no taxes, or they would drive their subjects into the neighbouring free States—as it is, they are well cloathed, well fed and taken good care of—The same author remarks, that the line which separates all Swisserland, from the countries around (where men like cattle are the property of their proud Lords and kept chained to the soil) is the line of division between light and darkness—between happiness and horror. The love of the Switzers for their country is altogether romantic and surpasses the bounds of credibility—those memorable relations authenticated by the common consent of all historians, of their beating on all occasions the flower of the Austrian and French troops (who have invaded them) with numbers so unequal and trifling as scarce to exceed their enemies out-guards; the instances of hundreds of citizens devoting their lives for the safety of their country; of their frequently disdaining life and refusing quarter when overpowered by numbers, have astonished and terrified the neighbouring powers, and seem incomprehensible to a people dispirited by taxes, overloaded with debts and disgusted with government. I cannot omit a striking characteristic, authenticated by Coxe and others, whose authority will not be questioned; they relate that there is a rustic tune familiar in the mountains of Swisserland—it is called the Rantz des vacqes—it consists of a few simple notes of native wild melody. The French and Dutch governments have been compelled to forbid under very severe penalties, the playing this woodland music, to those Swiss troops, which they hire for a limited time; the well-known notes revive instantly all the fond images, which were impressed on their youthful bosoms, their friends, their parents, their relations and their beloved country, rush into their imaginations in a full tide of affection—no persuasion can detain them, they desert home in regiments, or if retained by force, they pine away in the deepest melancholy—no instance has yet occurred of Swiss troops serving in any part [453]of Europe, who have not returned, with the diligence and anxiety of affectionate children, on the first appearance of danger to their parent country:3—The same amor-patriæ, the same divine love of their country, universally pervades the bosom of every citizen, who in right of his birth, legislates for himself:—Grosley relates that he saw in Rome a poor fellow (who had travelled through great part of Europe and Asia afoot) declaiming to a crowd with the most passionate zeal, in praise of his own country, boasting of her happiness and prefering San Marino to all the world besides4—This democratic republic, is a little bee-hive of free citizens, who have made a delicious garden of the top of a bleak barren mountain, situated in the midst of the finest and most fruitful plains of Italy, which tyranny has depopulated around them.—Look into the human breast—We love that power, which we exercise ourselves, but we detest that which others exercise over us, be they Representatives, Lords, or Kings; and to this source we may trace the abuse, which the Americans bestow on their country and their governments. But we are told that Swisserland, should be no example for us—I am very sorry for it—they are the only, the only part of the human species that sustain the dignity of character, belonging to the divine resemblance we bear,—they are few in number it is said—This is not true—they are more numerous then we are—They cover a small spot of territory—this is also not true—they possess a large tract of country in the very heart of Europe—but this is not all—The Helvetic confederacy, including the three leagues of the Grisons comprehends one hundred perhaps two hundred, independent governments and States—nor is there any reason from their history or present state to doubt, that the same plan of confederation might not be extended with as lasting and happy effects to one thousand independent governments—But it is also said they are a poor, frugal people—As to their poverty that is likewise untrue—they have great sums of money before hand and owe not a six-pence—they indeed are a wise and consequently a frugal people—though they still have great estates and even luxury among them too—But should we despise their poverty or their frugality? We who are so many millions worse than nothing? But still we are told we must not take example from them—we must take example from Holland and Germany—They had better at once tell us, that we must desert the worship of God and follow that of the devil. From the first dawn of light, that broke in upon my reason, I became devoted to governments of simplicity and equal right—The names of heroes, whose blood has bedewed the altars of freedom, vibrate like the shock of electricity, on my frame; and when I read the story of Brutus and of Cassius, the most noble and the last of the Romans, tears [454]of admiration gush from my eyes.—Under these impressions which only the grave can erase, I feel unspeakable horror at every step, which removes power and rights, at a greater distance from the body of the people, to whom they belong, and confines them to the hands of the few. I have proposed to myself this question: If representatives cannot govern the people—If they abuse the power entrusted to them, shall they devolve this power on a still smaller number, who must be more liable to corruption from the encrease of temptation? Or should they restore it into the hands of the people, from whom they received it? who alone are incorruptible, because the wealth of the few can never bribe the many, against the duty they owe to themselves. If I am told that the people are incapable of governing themselves—I shall answer that they have never been tried in America, except among the native Indians, who are free and happy, and who prove that self-government is the growth of our soil—And I also answer that they are more fit for self-government, than they are at present for any of the safe and solid governments, founded on representation.—When I see all these principles established by the example of the Swiss, who have remained under the simplest of all forms of government for near five hundred years, in uninterrupted tranquility and happiness—whilst every other invention of genius, devise of art, or imposition of force, has been torn up by the roots, with every aggravated circumstance of horror—I can no longer doubt—All the mists of theory and speculation vanish before an experiment like this. The greatest human discernment, ever concentrated in the mind of one man, was the portion of the celebrated Nicholas Machiavelli—a name loaded with abuse by tyrants, flatterers and the mushrooms of science, because he told the truth; because he was a republican and the friend of mankind in times of usurpation; or because, they have never read or do not understand his works. After every inquiry which the most unbounded information and reflection, with a long experience in high public office afforded, Machiavelli, delivers his deliberate opinion in favour of the body of the people, as the only safe depository of liberty and power—He prefers it to the aristocracy and the Prince; but he does not disgrace the inquiry by mentioning representation.5 If this was the opinion of Machiavelli, a citizen of Florence, where a numerous populace confined and crowded within the walls of a city, formed the most turbulent republic, that ever disgraced the cause of freedom by cruelty and anarchy—How much more favourably must his decision apply to the yeomanry of America—Landholders and consequently the most independent of mankind, mild by nature, moderate by manners, and persevering in every honest pursuit:—Surely if ever [455]men were worthy of being entrusted with their own rights, the freeholders of America are—Make them then and their posterity legislators by birth—I mean not the lowest populace—I mean that class of citizens to whom this country belongs:—Numbers unqualified by property, should have their influence—they should be protected—they might preserve the right of election—But they who hold the property of the soil, are alone entitled to govern it:—To effect this there would need but little change in the present forms—They might all stand—But the laws which pass the legislature before they become binding, should be referred to the different counties and cities—printed reasons drawn by committees, might if necessary, accompany each, together with an annual estimate of public wants and a detail of the expenditures of the former sums granted. Let these laws then be submitted to the free deliberation of the freeholders of the counties and cities—the numbers of the yeas and nays be taken on each by the presiding magistrate, and transmitted to the executive, who may then upon comparing the returns from the several counties and corporations, declare what laws are the will of the people. On the appearance of any sudden danger the two houses or indeed a majority of one house, might invest the Executive with that authority, exigency might require for the safety of the republic, until remedy should be provided by law. The number of representatives might be decreased and an expence saved—this would at one blow destroy all legislative speculations—the influence of demagogues, or oligarchic juntos must then cease—The assemblage of the freeholders, separate in different counties would prevent disturbance—As no new law could be made in them, little confusion could ensue—After some years, or even immediately if confined to future cases—the celebrated law of Geneva might be introduced, and no freeholder admitted to the assembly until he had paid his father’s debts. Sumptuary laws, permitting the use, but prohibiting the abuse of wealth, might be interposed to guard the public manners.—The Governor and two members of the senate might constitute a council of censors, to punish offenders against the sumptuary laws and the laws of morality, by a removal from office, and even disfranchisement, if necessary, with an appeal to the people of the county where the offender resided, in the latter case, and to the people of the State in the former.—Seminaries of useful learning, with professorships of political and domestic economy might be established in every county, discarding the philosophy of the moon and skies, we might descend to teach our citizens what is useful in this world—the principles of free government, illustrated by the history of mankind—the sciences of morality, agriculture, commerce, the management of farms and household [456]affairs—The light would then penetrate, where mental darkness now reigns.—Do these things and in a very few years, the people instead of abusing, would wade up to their knees in blood, to defend their governments. For some years past this has been the darling object of my life—to which all my views have tended—And I now think that nothing intermediate would be lasting or worthy the pursuit—Whenever I fairly lose sight of this—As soon as I turn my back forever on these dear illusions, which will be as soon as the proposed federal government is adopted—I shall turn all my wishes to that social state, whither that government will lead us, and I both hope and expect that with those amendments and guards, which it seems to be the general disposition to provide—it will gradually maturate in a safe and reasonable government.—Until that adoption I speak to my fellow citizens in the words of the proverb—Do not that by others, which you can do yourselves. (a) Before that period they were minions and favorites, who by plundering and oppressing the people excited constant commotion, and were seldom changed but with their masters, and by the axe or halter."
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,3/28/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. There is, my fellow-citizens, scarcely an individual of common understanding, I believe, in this State, who is any ways acquainted with the proposed constitution, who doth not allow it to be, in many instances, extremely censurable, and that a variety of alterations and amendments are essentially requisite, to render it consistent with a reasonable security for the liberty of the respective states, and their citizens. Aristides, it is true, is an exception from this observation; he declares, that “if the whole matter was left to his discretion, he would not change [457]any part of the proposed constitution;”2—whether he meant this declaration as a proof of his discretion, I will not say; it will, however, readily be admitted, by most, as a proof of his enthusiastic zeal in favour of the system:—But it would be injustice to that writer not to observe, that if he is as much mistaken in the other parts of the constitution, as in that which relates to the judicial department,3 the constitution which he is so earnestly recommending to his countrymen, and on which he is lavishing so liberally his commendation, is a thing of his own creation, and totally different from that which is offered for your acceptance.—He has given us an explanation of the original and appellate jurisdiction of the judiciary of the general government, and of the manner in which he supposes it is to operate, an explanation so inconsistent with the intention of its framers, and so different from its true construction, and from the effect which it will have, should the system be adopted, that I could scarce restrain my astonishment at the error, although I was, in some measure, prepared for it, by his previous acknowledgment, that he did not very well understand that part of the system;4 a circumstance I apprehended he did not recollect at the time when he was bestowing upon it his dying benediction:—And if one of our judges, possessed of no common share of understanding, and of extensive acquired knowledge, who, as he informs us, has long made the science of government his peculiar study, so little understands the true import and construction of this constitution, and that too in a part more particularly within his own province, can it be wondered at that the people in general, whose knowledge in subjects of this nature is much more limited and circumscribed, should but imperfectly comprehend the extent, operation and consequences of so complex and intricate a system?—and is not this, of itself, a strong proof of the necessity that it should be corrected and amended, at least so as to render it more clear and comprehensible to those who are to decide upon it, or to be affected by it? But although almost every one agrees the constitution, as it is, to be both defective and dangerous, we are not wanting in characters who earnestly advise us to adopt it, in its present form, with all its faults, and assure us we may safely rely on obtaining, hereafter, the amendments that are necessary:—But why, I pray you, my fellow-citizens, should we not insist upon the necessary amendments being made now, while we have the liberty of acting for ourselves, before the constitution becomes binding upon us by our assent, as every principle of reason, common sense and safety would dictate?—Because, say they, the sentiments of men are so different, and the interests of the different states [458]are so jarring and dissonant, that there is no probability they would agree if alterations and amendments were attempted.—Thus, with one breath, they tell us that the obstacles to any alterations and amendments being agreed to by the states, are so insuperable, that it is vain to make the experiment, while in the next, they would persuade us it is so certain the states will accede to those which shall be necessary, and that they may be procured even after the system shall be ratified, that we need not hesitate swallowing the poison, from the ease and security of instantly obtaining the antidote; and they seem to think it astonishing that any person should find a difficulty in reconciling the absurdity and contradiction! If it is easy to obtain proper amendments, do not let us sacrifice every thing that ought to be dear to freemen, for want of insisting upon its being done, while we have the power. If the obtaining them will be difficult and improbable, for God’s sake do not accept of such a form of government, as without amendments cannot fail of rendering you mere beasts of burthen, and reducing you to a level with your own slaves, with this aggravating distinction, that you once tasted the blessings of freedom. Those who would wish you to believe that the faults in the system proposed are wholly or principally owing to the difference of state interests, and proceed from that cause, are either imposed upon themselves, or mean to impose upon you.—The principal question in which the state interests had any material effect, were those which related to representation, and the number in each branch of the legislature, whose concurrence should be necessary for passing navigation acts, or making commercial regulations.—But what state is there in the union whose interest would prompt it to give the general government the extensive and unlimited powers it possesses in the executive legislature and judicial departments, together with the powers over the militia, and the liberty of establishing a standing army without any restriction?—What state in the union considers it advantageous to its interest, that the President should be re-eligible—the members of both houses appointable to offices—the judges capable of holding other offices at the will and pleasure of the government, and that there should be no real responsibility either in the President, or in the members of either branch of the legislature?—or what state is there that would have been averse to a bill of rights, or that would have wished for the destruction of jury trial in a great variety of cases, and in a particular manner in every case, without exception, where the government itself is interested?—These parts of the system, so far from promoting the interest of any state, or states, have an immediate tendency to annihilate all the state governments [459]indiscriminately, and to subvert their rights, and the rights of their citizens.—To oppose these, and to procure their alteration, is equally the interest of every state in the union.—The introduction of these parts of the system must not be attributed to the jarring interests of states, but to a very different source—the pride, the ambition and the interest of individuals:—This being the case, we may be enabled to form some judgment of the probability of obtaining a safe and proper system, should we have firmness and wisdom to reject that which is now offered; and also of the great improbability of procuring any amendments to the present system, if we should weakly and inconsiderately adopt it. The bold and daring attempt that has been made to use, for the total annihilation of the states, that power that was delegated for their preservation, will put the different states on their guard. The votaries of ambition and interest being totally defeated in their attempt to establish themselves on the ruins of the states, which they will be, if this constitution is rejected, an attempt in which they had more probability of success from the total want of suspicion in their countrymen, than they can have hereafter; they will not hazard a second attempt of the same nature, in which they will have much less chance of success; besides, being once discovered, they will not be confided in. The true interest and happiness of the states and their citizens will, therefore, most probably, be the object, which will be principally sought for by a second convention, should a second be appointed, which, if really aimed at, I cannot think very difficult to accomplish, by giving to the federal government sufficient power for every salutary purpose, while the rights of the states and their citizens should be secure from any imminent danger.—But if the arts and influence of ambitious and interested men, even in their present situation, while more on a level with yourselves, and unarmed with any extraordinary powers, should procure you to adopt this system, dangerous as it is admitted to be to your rights, I will appeal to the understanding of every one of you, who will, on this occasion, give his reason fair-play, whether there is not every cause to believe they will, should this government be adopted, with that additional power, consequence and influence it will give them, most easily prevent the necessary alterations which might be wished for, the purpose of which would be directly opposite to their views, and defeat every attempt to procure them.—Be assured, whatever obstacles or difficulties may be at this time in the way of obtaining a proper system of government, they will be increased an hundred fold after this system is adopted. Reflect also, I entreat you, my fellow-citizens, that the alterations and amendments which are wanted in the present system, are of such a [460]nature as to diminish and lessen, to check and restrain the powers of the general government, not to increase and enlarge those powers:—If they were of the last kind, we might safely adopt it, and trust to giving greater powers hereafter, like a Physician who administers an emetick, ex re nata, giving a moderate dose at first, and increasing it afterwards as the constitution of the patient may require.—But I appeal to the history of mankind for this truth, that when once power and authority are delegated to a government, it knows how to keep it, and is sufficiently and successfully fertile in expedients for that purpose:—Nay more, the whole history of mankind proves, that so far from parting with the powers actually delegated to it, government is constantly encroaching on the small pittance of rights reserved by the people to themselves, and gradually wresting them out of their hands, until it either terminates in their slavery, or forces them to arms, and brings about a revolution. From these observations it appears to me, my fellow-citizens, that nothing can be more weak and absurd, than to accept of a system that is admitted to stand in need of immediate amendments to render your rights secure; for remember, if you fail in obtaining them, you cannot free yourselves from the yoke you will have placed on your necks, and servitude must, therefore, be your portion! Let me ask you, my fellow-citizens, what you would think of a Physician, who, because you were slightly indisposed, should bring you a dose, which properly corrected with other ingredients might be a salutary remedy, but, of itself was a deadly poison, and with great appearance of friendship and zeal, should advise you to swallow it immediately, and trust to accident for those requisites necessary to qualify its malignity, and prevent its destructive effects?—Would not you reject the advice, in however friendly a manner it might appear to be given, with indignation, and insist that he should first procure, and properly attemper, the necessary ingredients, since after the fatal draught was once received into your bowels, it would be too late, should the antidote prove unattainable, and death must ensue?—With the same indignation ought you, my fellow-citizens, to reject the advice of those political quacks, who, under pretence of healing the disorders of our present government, would urge you rashly to gulp down a constitution, which, in its present form, unaltered and unamended, would be as certain death to your liberty, as arsenick could be to your bodies. Baltimore, March 25, 1788."
Broadside,No,Luther Martin,,,,3/30/1788,"The following sheets contain the information given by me to the legislature of Maryland, when officially called before them for that purpose:—No friend to his country will think that they require an apology; I should have been unworthy the trust reposed in me, and guilty of the blackest ingratitude to a State, which has given me the most distinguishing marks of its confidence, had I not been explicit.—No fact has been intentionally mis[s]tated by me, I aimed to be perfectly correct; and, though in some measure obliged to depend on my memory, I believe I have in no instance, given malice an opportunity to charge me with misrepresentation. No writer, with his name, has denied the information to be just—I think they never will—though we differ in politics, should it be necessary, there are men of honor who were in the convention, who are ready to decide in my favour; and I can, with confidence, appeal to a Washington, a Franklin, and other respectable members of the convention, for the veracity of my information. Few, very few, even of the anonymous publications have insinuated the information to be in any respect uncandid; and those few have confined themselves to generals, without daring to descend to particulars.—The lowest scurrility in the form of Extracts of letters, coined at the mint of meanness and falsehood, I have experienced; it is what I expected; I know myself, and I am known by others, to be infinitely above them, and have read them with a smile of contempt.—Me they cannot injure;—but they disgrace their authors, and the cause in which they are engaged.—This is a trifling sacrifice—In the cause of freedom, were it necessary, I am ready to make a much greater. As far as I have expressed my opinions of the views of the framers of the constitution, I have followed the fullest conviction of my mind, founded on my own observations made on their conduct while in convention, and confirmed by the conduct of the friends of the system since that time.—They were my sentiments while there; I at that time expressed them freely, and then found many who perfectly corresponded with me in sentiment, although some of them may not now choose to avow it, or, no doubt from a conviction of their error, may now advocate the system they there condemned and opposed. But as to myself, so far from having any reason to change the opinion I there formed, every circumstance which has since taken place has confirmed it. The conduct adopted by the convention, rendered the dissemination of these sheets the more necessary: Could there possibly be a greater indignity and insult offered to the majesty of the free States, and the free citizens of America, than for the very men who were entrusted with powers for the preservation and security of their rights, and for the establishment of a permanent system to promote their happiness, to make use of that power to destroy both the one and the other?—For this purpose, in time of profound peace, to shut themselves up in mystery and darkness; to keep all their deliberations an absolute secret from their constituents, who were to be affected thereby; to prevent the publication of their journals; to deprive the free citizens of America of every means of information: to attempt to pass upon them, as meeting with their unanimous approbation, that which did not in reality meet with the perfect approbation of perhaps one individual in the convention; to give you no other alternative but to accept of it as proposed, without alteration, or to reject it entirely, while at the same time some of them were resounding, from one end of the continent to the other, the necessity of its acceptance, and that none but the enemies of their country would reject it—And to abuse your confidence in them, by endeavouring to hurry you into a hasty adoption, under that delusion, before you could obtain information, and be able to form a proper judgement for yourselves. Such a conduct in any other country, or even in this, at any other time, would have drawn down upon them the indignation and resentment of those who were thus attempted to be abused and enslaved. To counteract the views of ambition and interest has been my aim—To this I devoted every effort while in convention—The same motives have directed my conduct since—Should my exertions in the smallest degree assist in effecting the rejection of this detestable system of slavery, I shall enjoy the highest possible gratification, that of rendering my country an essential benefit. But should the system be adopted, I shall even then enjoy the highest possible consolation which a good citizen can enjoy in the public calamity, that of having conscientiously discharged my duty to my country, by endeavouring to avert it. Baltimore, March 30, 1788."
Broadside,No,A Citizen of the State of Maryland,,,,3/30/1788,"REMARKS relative to a BILL of RIGHTS. It has been asserted by many, that a bill of rights was altogether useless, and in some respects a dangerous experiment; such an opinion [514]is evidently calculated to mislead the people, and to take off the necessary checks from those who will be entrusted with the administration of government. We are told by that able advocate for constitutional liberty, Lord Abingdon, that in every free government “there are found three principal powers, the first of these is the power of the people; the second, the power of the constitution; the third, the power of the law.—That the constitution ascertains the reciprocal duties, or several relations subsisting betwixt the governors and governed; that the law, or third power of the State, maintains the rights, and adjusts the differences arising between individuals, as parts of the same whole.”1 Thus his Lordship makes a very evident distinction between the constitution and the law; he also calls the rights of the people the substantial parts of the constitution. From a perusal of his letter to Mr. Edward Burke, it is evident, he considers the constitution, as that power which gives law, or restrains the conduct of the legislature; that as the laws of the land are the rule of action to the people; so the principles of the constitution direct the legislature in their several duties, for the rules of the one are to the other, what the law is to the Judges. In examining the constitution for the United States, as proposed by the late convention, I do not find any explicit declaration respecting the rights of the people, that can be considered as a sufficient guide on these points to the legislature, though they ought to to have been its substantial parts. It is true, the legislature may act according to their own principles of equity and reason; but these may differ from real constitutional principles, which should be so particularly expressed, that the constitution might have a controul over the legislature and the law. “My idea of government,” says Lord Abingdon, “to speak as a lawyer would do, is, that the legislatures are the trustees of the people, the constitution the deed of gift, wherein they stood seized to uses only, and those uses being named, they cannot depart from them; but for their due performance are accountable to those by whose conveyance the trust was made. The right is therefore fiduciary, the power limited; or, as a mathematician would say, more in the road of demonstration; the constitution is a circle, the laws the radii of that circle, drawn on its surface with the pen of the legislature, and it is the known quality of a circle that its radii cannot exceed its circumference, whilst the people, like the compasses, are fixed in the center, and describe the circle.”2 I do not perceive in the new constitution, those uses named, for which the administration of government is entrusted; no directing principles, [515]sufficient for security of life, liberty, property, and freedom in trade; and therefore, as a supplement, a declaration or bill of rights is evidently wanting; otherwise, we shall have a legislature without check or controul; which if it should take place, it would open a door to every species of fraud and oppression.—Should the present system now proposed, pass without amendments, it would immediately constitute an aristocratic tyranny, a many-headed leviathan, an ungovernable monster, without constitutional checks, deplorable and to be deplored, dangerous and destructive, in proportion to the number of which it consists. An eminent lawyer expressed an idea, which has been re-echoed, and become pretty general, “that what power was not expressly given, was retained by the people.”3—Another civilian, of equal standing and professional abilities, has asserted the reverse of this proposition, and insisted that what power was not expressly declared, was relinquished and given up:4—Since then, the sentiments of men, respectable for their talents, are so discordant on essential points surely, the common people may well be at a loss in a choice of their political guides,—and the safest way for them must be, to insist upon a solemn declaration of their rights and privileges, as the substantial and unalterable parts of the constitution: for such a declaration cannot be prejudicial; but may restrain the growth of despotism, the wantonness of power, and the base, licentious attempts of juvenile, daring ambition. In fine, let me caution the supreme power, the people, to take care how they part with their birth-right; that they do not, like Esau, sell it for a mess of pottage;5 and let them reflect, seriously reflect, on the inestimable value of the least atom of their liberty; she is more precious than rubies, and all the things that can be desired, are not to be compared unto her."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,Aristides,4/1/1788,"Retired in the country the publication by Aristides did not reach the Farmer until this moment.1 The object of the remarks by the Farmer was to draw the attention of the public to a question of the greatest magnitude to them and their posterity; and the cause in which he has ventured to publish his sentiments is a cause of the United States.—The great and manifest defects in the national government proposed for America,—the omission of a declaration to ascertain the rights of the several States, and the rights of individuals, the primary object of every good and free government, particularly the trial by jury on suit against a federal officer for abuse of authority;—the want of proper checks to prevent the abuse, or annihilation of those rights;—the manifest danger to public liberty from a standing army, without limitation of number, in time of peace;—and the pernicious doctrines of Aristides; alone induced the Farmer to lay his reflections before the tribunal of public opinion. It would give the Farmer real pain to stain a public cause with private altercation, and he flatters himself that his candid and impartial readers will admit, that his first address, which has given so great offence to Aristides, and which he calls abuse, slander, calumny, and a wanton and unprovoked attack on his good name, was temperate, moderate, and decent, and even respectful to that writer. The Farmer took the liberty to condemn and to expose the doctrines and errors of Aristides; but with charity he imputed his opinions to defect of judgment, or want of information. A good and virtuous citizen may, from want of understanding, maintain principles incompatible with the public welfare. If his [463]integrity is not accused he should bear admonition or reproof with temper and moderation. If his opinions are censured he should justify or explain them with candor and decency, and should treat his adversary with respect. If his motives of action are questioned, he should defend himself with dignity and manly firmness, without petulance or asperity, or as Aristides recommends, “he should behave like a gentleman.” Personalities are always odious and can only be excused by the imputation of political opinions to improper, unworthy or base motives. The Farmer could not possibly entertain any personal resentment against Aristides. A knowledge by sight and a very few occasional conversations comprehend all the acquaintance between them. The Farmer was disposed to think well of Aristides from the report of some few of his acquaintance, and not from his own declaration, however solemn, of his immaculate purity, and love of country; for in this degenerate age the integrity and the patriotism of men must be measured by their actions, and not their professions. The Farmer disdains intentionally to misrepresent Aristides, he may have been so unfortunate as to have misunderstood him. It seems that what the Farmer considered as the opinions of Aristides were only objections to a bill of rights by some æriel forms, which he has pleased to usher into his drama to close the catastrophe, when from the former character he had assumed, he could not so well appear with the sword himself. Why did Aristides put groundless objections in the mouths of any persons, which no persons had ever used? What sense is there in making objections of no weight (and which he himself despised) to a bill of rights, under the covert of persons of his own creating?—If the Farmer misunderstood Aristides, it might have arose from his combining with his general doctrine a report of a declaration by him of the respect and regard he would pay to the Maryland bill of rights in his judicial capacity.—The Farmer then firmly believed, and he still believes that Aristides thought that bills of rights were considered in Europe as grants of Kings. The Farmer knew that this had been the language and argument of a Judge of another State.2 All the arguments of the Farmer went to prove that they were not so considered in Europe, attended with the observation that he never knew the doctrine advanced in print, but by Filmer and Aristides.3 Aristides insinuates that the remarks of the Farmer on his opinions proceeded from his desire to pay court to a gentleman who lately held the highest office in the State.4 This insinuation is as false as it is mean and illiberal. The Farmer can respect and esteem the public and private virtues of a citizen without degrading himself to the lowest servility of [464]the lowest sycophant. The Farmer has never dealt in the fulsome language of modern dedications, and if inclined, he could not direct his flatteries to obtain any office civil or military, under the new government. The Farmer has no wish to conceal himself from the apprehension of censure from an impartial public; and from the resentment of Aristides it is impossible he can have any thing to fear. A fancied superiority, and insolence of office gave birth to this unwarrantable suggestion. There may be other reasons why Aristides has thought proper to make known his real name to the public than those he has suggested. If his vanity prompted him to believe, that his character would carry respect and authority to his publication, never was any political writer more mistaken. His pamphlet will injure the cause he undertakes to defend wherever it appears. It might be expected that Aristides would be more competent to understand the part of the new constitution, that establishes the judiciary, than any other.5 He approves the whole system, and yet he knows the least of what he ought to understand the most. He says the article erecting the judiciary has been generally misconceived, and the Farmer verily believes by no person more than by Aristides. That Farmers and Planters should not comprehend the jurisdiction of the federal judicial power might be expected; but that a great law character, like Aristides, should so egregiously blunder, is very astonishing. A man grossly mistaken in his profession may be justly suspected in other subjects. Aristides asserts, “that the inferial federal courts, and the State courts will have concurrent original jurisdiction in all the enumerated cases, wherein an appeal lies to the supreme federal court, except only the cases created by, or under the proposed constitution.”—By the second section of the third article, “The judicial power is to extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under the constitution, or the laws of the United States; and to all controversies between citizens of different States, and the citizens of any of the United States, and the citizens, or subjects, of foreign States;” and by the eighth section of the first article, “The Congress are invested with power to levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; and to make such laws as shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution these powers.” Aristides contends that a federal officer, say an excise officer, may be sued by a citizen in a State court (I suppose any county court as well as the supreme court) for an abuse of his authority; and with confidence he asserts, “That no sound lawyer, of a good moral reputation will maintain the contrary opinion;” and he treats with supercilious contempt the objection of want of remedy in a State court, and a trial by jury for the citizen against a federal officer, for an abuse of office, “as a ridiculous bugbear, fit only [465]to alarm minds on which no science has ever dawned.” Is it not evident that the jurisdiction in the cases above-mentioned, is expressly given to the inferior federal courts, with an appeal, both as to law and fact, to the supreme federal court?—Is it not clear that it was intended to keep the federal and State jurisdictions entirely separate? Were not the subordinate federal courts established to protect the continental revenue officers from the State jurisdictions?—If an action would lie against a federal officer in the State courts would it not blend and confound the two jurisdictions, and that too without any appeal from the State courts?—Is not the supreme federal court superior to the State courts? Is it not superior to the bills of rights, and the constitutions, of the several States?—If the State courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the inferior federal courts, that is, if any suit of which the latter has cognizance by the new government, may notwithstanding be instituted in the former, is it not self-evident that there may be different adjudications on the same question; and if decided in the inferior federal court with an appeal, if decided in a State court without any appeal, to the supreme federal court? What would be the effect of opposite decisions by two courts having concurrent jurisdiction?—If an action is commenced in a State court, Aristides thinks, and justly too, that thence there is no appeal to the supreme federal court, but only to their own high court of appeals, as heretofore. With confidence he maintains that as the jurisdiction of the State courts is not taken away by an express clause, or necessary implication, that they will still have cognizance of those cases of which jurisdiction is given to the inferior federal courts. The Farmer believes there is not another lawyer, or Judge, of sound judgment in the law, in all America, that entertains a similar opinion.—The Farmer is so bold as to hazard his opinion, contrary to that of Aristides, that if a citizen of Georgia, or subject of Great-Britain, has any claim against a citizen of Maryland, or if he has any claim against them, that suits in such cases, after the establishment of the national government, can only be commenced and prosecuted in the inferior federal courts, because the State courts are ousted of their jurisdiction of those cases, by necessary implication, from the obvious motives for the establishment of the federal judiciary, and the evident absurdities that must flow from a concurrent jurisdiction in the same cases. Is it not absurd to suppose that the national governments intended that the State courts should have jurisdiction to decide on the laws of the United States, whether consonant or repugnant to the national constitution; or whether the federal officers abuse their authority?—And yet the grave, the solemn, the didactic Aristides asserts, “That every State Judge will have a right to reject any act handed to him as a law of the United States, which he may conceive repugnant to the constitution.”6 How perverted or confused must be the head of that man who [466]can seriously entertain so ridiculous an opinion! He can never claim from his knowledge of the national, or any other government to be one of the Judges of the most inferior of the inferior federal courts—Risum teneatis. A puisne Judge of a petty State (of Delaware, or Rhode-Island) to have a right to declare a law of the United States void? Will any sound lawyer, his moral reputation out of the question, risk his legal character so far as to maintain this assertion?—If Aristides has not too much pride to be convinced, if he has the candour he professes, or the legal or political knowledge he wishes the world to believe, he would not obstinately continue in error, but confess, how greatly he has misunderstood the judiciary system of the national government. If Aristides shall determine to mix private resentment with a public cause, if he cannot discuss political questions without descending to offensive personalities, or if he wishes to examine into the motives or private reputation of his adversary, as he very improperly calls the Farmer, he is informed that the Farmer has left his real name with the Printer.—If Aristides can discover ought in the life or manners of the Farmer, the detection of which may serve the public cause, or gratify private malice, he has free liberty to publish, to expose it to the world, in the strongest colours;—he will for his own sake confine himself to fact.—Calumniating invective may rouse any temper. Aristides has too long held a licentious pen with impunity. March 24, 1788."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer and Planter,,Maryland Journal,,4/1/1788,"To the FARMERS and PLANTERS of MARYLAND. Fellow-Citizens, The time is nearly at hand, when you are called upon to render up that glorious liberty you obtained, by resisting the [467]tyranny and oppression of George the Third, King of England, and his ministers.—The first Monday in April is the day appointed by our assembly, for you to meet and choose delegates in each county, to take into consideration the new Federal Government, and either adopt or refuse it. Let me entreat you, my fellows, to consider well what you are about—Read the said Constitution, and consider it well before you act—I have done so, and can find that we are to receive but little good, and a great deal of evil—Aristocracy, or government in the hands of a very few nobles, or rich men, is therein concealed in the most artful wrote plan that ever was formed to entrap a free people. The contrivers of it have so completely entrapped you, and laid their plan so sure and secretly, that they have only left you to do one of two things; that is either to receive or refuse it. And in order to bring you into their snare, you may daily read new pieces published in the News-Papers, in favour of this new government; and should a writer dare to publish any piece against it, he is immediately abused and vilified. Look round you and observe well the rich men, who are to be your only rulers, lords and masters in future! Are they not all for it? Yes! Ought not this to put you on your guard? Does not riches beget power, and power, oppression and tyranny? I am told that four of the richest men in Ann-Arundel County, have offered themselves candidates to serve in the Convention, who are all in favour of the new Federal Government;2 let me beg of you to reflect a moment on the danger you run—If you choose these men, or others like them, they certainly will do every thing in their power to adopt the new government—Should they succeed, your liberty is gone for ever; and you will then be nothing better than a strong ass crouching down between two burthens3—The new form of government gives Congress liberty at any time, by their laws, to alter the state laws, and the time, places and manner of holding elections for representatives; by this clause they may command, by their laws, the people of Maryland to go to Georgia, and the people of Georgia to go to Boston, to choose their representatives—Congress, or our future lords and masters, are to have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises—Excise is a new thing in America, and few country farmers and planters know the meaning of it; but it is not so in Old England, where I have seen the effects of it, and felt the smart. It is there a duty, or tax, laid upon almost every necessary of life and convenience, and a great number of other articles. The excise on salt in the year 1762, to the best of my recollection, in England, was 4s. sterling per bushel, for all that was made use of in families, and the price of salt per bushel about 6s. sterling, and the excise 4s. 6d. on every gallon of rum made use of. If [468]a private family make their own soap, candles, beer, cider, &c. &c. they pay an excise-duty on them; and if they neglect calling in an excise-officer at the time of making these things, they are liable to grievous fines and forfeitures, besides a long train of evils and inconveniencies attending this detestable excise; to enumerate particularly would fill a volume—The excise-officers have power to enter your houses at all times, by night or day, and if you refuse them entrance, they can, under pretence of searching for exciseable goods, that the duty has not been paid on, break open your doors, chests, trunks, desks, boxes, and rummage your houses from bottom to top; nay, they often search the cloaths, petticoats and pockets of ladies or gentlemen, (particularly when they are coming from on board an East-India ship) and if they find any the least article that you cannot prove the duty to be paid on, seize it and carry it away with them; who are the very scurf and refuse of mankind, who value not their oaths, and will break them for a shilling. This is their true character in England, and I speak from experience, for I have had the opportunity of putting their virtue to the test; and saw two of them break their oath for one guinea, and a third for one shilling’s worth of punch. What do you think of a law to let loose such a set of vile officers among you! Do you expect the Congress excise-officers will be any better, if God, in his anger, should think it proper to punish us for our ignorance, and sins of ingratitude to him, after carrying us through the late war, and giving us liberty, and now so tamely to give it up by adopting this aristocratical government? Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers. This seems to imply, that we shall be taxed by the poll again, which is contrary to our bill of rights;4 but it is possible that the rich men, who are the great landholders, will tax us in this manner, which will exempt them from paying assessments on their great bodies of land in the old and new parts of the United States; many of them having but few taxable by the poll.—Our great Lords and Masters are to lay taxes, raise and support armies, provide a navy, and may appropriate money for two years, call forth the militia to execute their laws, suppress insurrections, and the President is to have the command of the militia.—Now, my countrymen, I would ask you, why are all these things directed and put into their power?—Why, I conceive, they are to keep you in a good humour; and if you should, at any time, think you are imposed upon by Congress and your great Lords and Masters, and refuse or delay to pay your taxes, or do any thing that they shall [469]think proper to order you to do, they can, and I have not a doubt but they will, send the militia of Pennsylvania, Boston, or any other state or place, to cut your throats, ravage and destroy your plantations, drive away your cattle and horses, abuse your wives, kill your infants, and ravish your daughters, and live in free quarters, until you get into a good humour, and pay all that they may think proper to ask of you, and you become good and faithful servants and slaves.(a)—Such things have been done, and I have no doubt will be done again, if you consent to the adoption of this new federal government. You laboured under many hardships whilst the British tyrannized over you!—you fought, conquered and gained your liberty—then keep it, I pray you, as a precious jewel—trust it not out of your own hands—be assured, if you do, you will never more regain it—the train is laid, the match is on fire, and they only wait for yourselves to put it to the train, to blow up all your liberty and commonwealth governments, and introduce aristocracy and monarchy, and despotism will follow of course, in a few years: for a four-years President will be, in time, a King for life, and after him, his son, or he that has the greatest power among them, will be King also.—View your danger, and find out good men to represent you in convention—men of your own profession and station in life—men who will not adopt this destructive and diabolical form of a federal government:—There are many among you that will not be led by the nose by rich men, and would scorn a bribe.—Rich men can live easy under any government, be it ever so tyrannical—they come in for a great share of the tyranny, because they are the ministers of tyrants, and always engross the places of honour and profit, whilst the greater part of the common people are led by the nose, and played about by these very men, for the destruction of themselves and their class.—Be wise, be virtuous, and catch the precious moment as it passes, to refuse this new-fangled federal government, and extricate yourselves and posterity from tyranny, oppression, aristocratical or monarchical government. You, who have an opportunity of getting the news-papers, no doubt have seen the farce and parade at Boston!—they adopted the federal government, and afterwards proposed amendments5—let us be wiser—let us not adopt it until it is amended.—I revere the characters of some of the gentlemen that composed the convention at Philadelphia, yet I think they were human, and subject to imposition and error, as well as the rest of mankind.—You lost eight or ten years of your lives and labour by the last war, and were left at last with your debts and incumbrances on you, and numbers of you were soon after the close of [470]it, sued and harrassed for them—your persons have been put into a loathsome prison, and others of you have had your property sold for taxes, and by your rapacious creditors, for one fourth, and sometimes for one tenth of its former and actual value; and you now pay very grievous and heavy taxes, double and treble what you paid before the war; and should you adopt this new government, your taxes will be greatly increased to support them, their officers, servants, and retainers, who will be multiplied upon you to keep you in obedience, and collect their duties, taxes, impositions, and excises. Some of you may say the rich men were virtuous in the last war; yes, my countrymen, they had reason then to be so! our liberty then was in dispute with a mighty and powerful tyrant, and it was for their interest to promote and carry on the opposition, as long as they could stay at home and send the common people into the field to fight their battles—After the war began, they could not with decency recede, for the sword and enemy were at the very entrance of their gates. The case is greatly altered now; you conquered the enemy, and the rich men now think to subdue you by their wiles and arts, or make you, or persuade you, to do it yourselves. Their aim, I perceive, is now to destroy that liberty which you set up as a reward for the blood and treasure you expended in the pursuit of and establishment of it. They well know that open force will not succeed at this time, and have chosen a safer method, by offering you a plan of a new Federal Government, contrived with great art, and shaded with obscurity, and recommended to you to adopt; which if you do, their scheme is compleated, the yoke is fixed on your necks, and you will be undone, perhaps for ever, and your boasted liberty is but a sound. Farewell!—be wise, be watchful, guard yourselves against the dangers that are concealed in this plan of a new Federal Government. March 27, 1788.

Letter,No,John Francis Mercer,,,,4/1/1788,"To the Members of the Conventions of New York and Virginia5.5.I 5.5.2 Gentlemen The galling Chains of Despotizm under the oppressive weight of which nine tenths of our Fellow Mortals groan-the Tortures which unfeeling Tyranny has invented and fearlessly practized in every Age and every Clime, are melancholy and terrifying proofs of the Incapacity of the many to defend those rights, which God and Nature gave them, from the artful and unceasing usurpations of the Few:-and they are frightful Lessons to teach us a watchful Jealousy of great and unnecessary Grants of Power and of Changes in a State of Society which we know to be mild and free-Still there are moments of national Languor and Lethargy which the Ambitious [,J ever enterprizing [,J mark with Alacrity and use with Success.-The People long unaccustomed in a good and guarded Government, to bold and selfish Designs in their Rulers, look up with an unsuspicious Confidence, to any alteration, which those entrusted with Power may propose-however unconstitutional the changes, if recommended by Men used to govern them, they seem to come forward under the Sanction of legal authority-if prepared in Secrecy-the public mind taken by surprize, and every Engine previously set in Motion-the unconcerted and unconnected Defence of Individuals is branded with the opprobrious Epithet of Opposition and overwhelmed in the directed Tide of popular Clamour-a clamour which a Number of wealthy Men may at all Times command at a small Expence from the most indigent of the Populace.! We forbear to remark on the Manner in which the Constitution proposed for the United States came forward-as the Circumstances are known to you, your own Feelings will render any Observations unnecessary. The Object of our present Address is to prevent your forming unjust Conclusions from the Adoption of the Constitution in the State of Maryland by so large a Majority of the Convention and the subsequent dissolution of that Body, without proposing any Amendments. 2_ Permit us to assure You that the Torrent which burst forth at the Birth of the Constitution had but little Effect on the Minds of many of us-and altho' it might prevent our having that weight with our Countrymen, in the first Paroxisms of Phrenzy which forever accompany great and sudden Revolutions in Government-we were yet determined not to be wanting in our Duty to the Republic, at that Moment when Reason should resume her Empire over the unagitated Minds of our fellow Citizens-~from many Circumstances we despaired of this in Maryland untill the adoption of the Constitution-At that Period, when our Efforts could not be subjected to Calumniating Misrepresentation,-we expected that an Appeal to the reflection of our Countrymen, would be listened to with attention and produce those Effects which unanswered and unanswerable Reasons ought to command-All opposition being thus postponed and every necessary Step to inform the minds of our Citizens on one Side neglected-while unremitting Exertions by a Number of wealthy and respectable Characters were continued on the other-it cannot be surprizing that the Elections were generally favorable to the Constitution-In a very few of the Counties did any Candidates propose themselves against it-very few voted and even in those Counties where the Opposition succeeded by such a decided Majority-those Gentlemen's offering was merely accidental. They had refused every Solicitation of the People and had actually determined not to serve in Convention until within 6 Days before the Election That the People of the State would have made alterations and amendments a Condition of Adoption, is a Question which from the above Circumstances it is impossible to decide-but that four fifths of the people of Maryland are now in favor of considerable Alterations and Amendments, and will insist on them,-we dont hesitate to declare (as our Opinion) to You and the world.- The difference between amending before or after adoption (provided it is amended) is certainly not worth a Distinction. We are persuaded that the People of so large a Continent, so different in Interests, so distinct in Habits, cannot in all cases legislate in one Body by themselves or their Representatives-By themselves it is obviously impracticable-By their Representatives it will be found on Investigation equally so--for if these representatives are to pursue the general Interest without Constitutional checks and restraints-it must be done by a mutual Sacrifice of the Interests, wishes and prejudices of the parts they represent-and then they cannot be said to represent those Parts, but to misrepresent them. 3-Besides as their Constituents cannot judge of their Conduct by their own Sense of what is right and proper-and as a representative can always in this view screen his abuse of Trust under the Cloak of Compromize, we do not see what check can remain in the Hands of the Constituents-for they cannot Know how far the Compromise was necessary and the representative wrong-and to tum out and disgrace a Man when they cannot prove him wrong, and when he will have of Course the voice of the Body he is a Member of in his Favor, would in the Event be found subversive of the Principles of good Government. Thus then the pursuit of the general Interest produces an unchecked Misrepresentation-but if Representatives are to pursue the partial Interests of the Districts they represent (which to recommend themselves to their Constituents it is most probable they will do) then the Majority must ruin the Minority, for the Majority will be found interested to throw the Burthens of Government upon that Minority which in these States present a fair Opening by difference of Cultivation-lmportation and property-In such extensive Territories governed by one Legislature, the Experience of Mankind tells us that if not by Preference the People will at least be led gradually to confide the legislative Power to the Hands of one Man and his Family-who alone can represent the whole, without partial Interests[-]and this is or leads to unlimited Despotizm We have not that permanent and fixed distinction of ranks or orders of Men among us, which unalterably seperating the interests and views, produces that division in pursuits, which is the great security of the mixed Government we seperated from, and which we now seem so anxiously to copy;4-[I]f the New Senate of the United States will be really opposite in their pursuits and views from the Representatives, have they not a most dangerous power, of interesting foreign Nations by Treaty to support their views?-for instance the relinquishment of the navigation of Missisippi And yet these Treaties are expressly declared paramount to the Constitutions of the several States and being the Supreme Law, must of course control the national legislature, if not supercede the Constitution of the United States itself-[T]he check of the President over a Body, with which he must act in concert, or his influence and power be almost annihilated, can prove no great Constitutional security; And even the Representative body itself-and much more the Senate-are not sufficiently numerous to secure them from corruption-for all Governments tend to corruption, in proportion as power concentrating in the hands of the few. renders them objects of corruption to Foreign Nations and among themselves For these and many other reasons we are for preserving the Rights of the State Governments, where they must not be necessarily relinquished for the welfare of the Union-and where so relinquished the line should be definitely drawn[.p [I]f under the proposed Constitution the States exercise any Power, it would seem to be at the mercy of the General Government-for it is remarkable that the clause securing to them those rights not expressly relinquished in the old Confoederation, is left out in the new Constitution; And we conceive that there is not Power which Congress may think necessary to exercise for the general welfare. which they may not assume under this Constitution-and this Constitution and the Laws made under it are declared paramount even to the unalienable rights, which have heretofore been assured to the Citizens of these States by their Constitutional compacts. Altho' this new Constitution can boast indeed of a Bill of Rights of seven Articles-yet of what nature is that Bill of Rights? to hold out such a security to the rights of property as might lead very wealthy and influential Men and Families into a blind compliance and adoption-whilst the Rights that are essential to the great body of Yeomanry of America are entirely disregarded .Moreover those very powers, which are to be expressly vested in the new Congress, are of a nature most liable to abuse-They are those which tempt the avarice and ambition of Men to a violation of the rights of their fellow Citizens, and they will be screened under the sanction of an undefined and unlimited authority-Against the abuse and improper exercise of these special powers, the People have a right to be secured by a sacred Declaration, defining the rights of the Individual and limiting by them, the extent of the exercise-The People were secured against the abuse of those Powers by fundamental Laws and a Bill of Rights, under the Government of Britain and under their own Constitutions-That Government which permits the abuse of Power, recommends it; and will deservedly experience the tyranny which it authorizes; for the history of Mankind establishes the truth of this political adage--that in Government what may be done will be done. 6 The most blind admirer of this Constitution must in his heart confess that it is as far inferior to the British Constitution, of which it is an imperfect imitation [,] as darkness is to light-In the British Constitution, the rights of Men, the primary objects of the social Compact-are fixed on an immoveable foundation and clearly defined and ascertained by their Magna Charta, their Petition of Rights and Bill of Rights[;] and their Effective administration by ostensible Ministers, secures Responsibility-In this new Constitution-a complicated System sets responsibility at defiance and the Rights of Men, neglected and undefined[,] are left at the mercy of events; We vainly plume ourselves on the safeguard alone of Representation, forgetting that it will be a Representation on principles inconsistent with true and just Representation-that it is but a delusive shadow of Representation proffering in theory what can never be fairly reduced to practice;-And after all Government by Representation (unless confirmed in its views and conduct by the constant inspection, immediate superintendance, and frequent interference and control of the People themselves on one side, or an hereditary nobility on the other, both of which orders have fixed and permanent views) is really only a scene of perpetual rapine and confusion.-and even with the best checks it has failed in all the Governments of Europe, of which it was once the basis, except that of England. 7_ When We tum our Eyes back to the scenes of blood and desolation which we have waded through to separate from Great Britain-we behold with manly indignation that our blood and treasure have been wasted to establish a Government in which the Interest of the few is preferred to the Rights of the Many-When We see a Government so every way inferior to that we were born under, proposed as the reward of our sufferings in an eight years calamitous war---our astonishment is only equalled by our resentment-On the conduct of Virginia and New York, two important States [,] the preservation of Liberty in a great measure depends-the chief security of a Confoederacy of Republics was boldly disregarded and the old Confoederation violated by requiring Nine instead of 13 voices to alter the Constitution.[B]ut still the resistance of either of these States, in the present temper of America (for the late conduct of the Party here must open the eyes of the People in Massachusetts with respect to the fate of their amendments) will secure all that we mean to contend for-The natural and unalienable Rights of Men in a constitutional manner-At the distant appearance of danger to these, We took up arms in the late Revolution-and may we never have cause to look back with regret on that period when connected with the Empire of Great Britain, We were happy, secure, and free ."
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,Aristides,4/4/1788,"Aristides with a degree of confidence, which many will deem presumption, insinuates that his arguments can only be combated by sophistry:—Language expressly calculated to impose on the uninformed mind may be justly suspected; but remarks addressed to the reason of those who are happy in education and leisure for reflection, can never do injury:—Sophistry may blind or mislead the wavering and inconstant mind, of the humble and unenlightened individual; but to convince the understanding and rouse the spirit, of the intelligent part of mankind, is the sacred province of truth alone. To examine and elucidate the great and leading principles of government, we must penetrate to the source of human action, and explore the heart and constitution of man;—a consciousness of the equal rights of nature, is a component part of that ætherial spirit, which we dignify with the appellation of soul; the ardent desire and unceasing pursuit of equality, can therefore be no more destroyed by human power, than the soul itself; the chains of terrestrial despotism may confine, afflict and bow down to the earth, this mould of flesh; but the soul more free than air, quits this mortal frame, surrounded by ills no longer supportable, and after witnessing the final overthrow of all its hopes in this world, retires with indignation, into a world unknown. Let any people be personally and fairly consulted on the form of that government, which is to rule them and their children, and they will establish the law of equality as its basis;—the unequal division of property silently and gradually, undermines this foundation, almost as soon as society is formed; or before a new compact is confirmed, this equality is materially injured if not destroyed.—Montesquieu justly observes that men, in the advanced stages of government, quit the equality of nature, from the moment of their birth, never to re-enter it but by the force of equal law;2—the law then that is equally enforced on all ranks of society, to which the great and the humble, are compelled to submit, in the next state of equality, to which this ever active principle of the mind aspires; with this it would be content, as the most perfect state of liberty, which exists only, in a just medium between two extremes; but in the attainment and preservation of this, the efforts of the human understanding never keep pace with the will. Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur achivi. It is the poor people who suffer for the misrule of the great.3 Laws are cobwebs, catching only the flies and letting the wasps escape. The great and powerful, can easily bring to justice, the poor and humble offender; but who is to lead to punishment the great? These lords of the earth, who have extensive and powerful connexions, who aim at no trifling [luxuries?]; but who plunder a people of their liberties and put public revenues into their private purses, under the sanction of laws made by themselves:—These are the men who deprive their fellow mortals of their fondest hopes, and compel them to resort to the supreme aim of a monarch—to the authority of a single person—who exalted far above all may reduce them all, once more to that common level of equal law, of which mankind never lose sight:—Come we will choose one man to rule over us! is the cry of a people who are tired of the rule of the elders—the meaning of the word senate, is an assembly of elders; but this the last and most fatal step, is never retrieved, until government returns through blood into that original chaos—from the discordant elements of which, new and equal forms of society arise, created upon first principles. The corruption of the rule of one man is also regular and perhaps like every other progressive step of mixed government—unavoidable.—He is at first limited and his hands tied; but as the powerful and strong are alone able to keep him confined—they are the checks which are necessarily imposed.—The elders, or the senate, are always joined in power to guard against his usurpations:—The people in this event, find that instead of a protector of their equal rights, they have elected a [475]patron for the rich and powerful, who, under the sanction of his name and authority, plunder and oppress with still greater security.—If a weak Prince should attempt to curb their insolence, he generally becomes himself the sacrifice to his own temerity—the proud chiefs rebel—put new shackles on their principal;—until at length tired of his own uneasy and dependant situation—disgusted at sheltering evil and his incapacity to do good—Some able and politic chieftain breaks the bonds of restraint; perhaps with the manly boldness of a Gustavus Erickson, he may demand of the representatives of the nation, to take back that power which is only a cloak for vice and which is too weak to do good.—He may request them to deprive him of the authority he had received, or give him that which would enable him to secure the public prosperity and private happiness.—Let him leave the legislature with a stern firmness—retire to an army who adore him, and submission must follow;—or let such a chief pursue the more usual rout to power—let him profit of the discontents of the multitude and he will quickly fasten the cords of authority around the necks of the great. The chief magistrate is now cloathed with full authority to do good.—If he does so, he confirms a solid tyranny for his degenerate successors—For if power does not corrupt him it certainly will those that follow:—In this view, the best elected magistrates have only entailed misery on mankind—the wise and moderate administration of Augustus, (who was appointed commander in chief of the established forces, and was annually elected consul during the whole period of his life) secured the power and gave full scope to the vices of Tiberius, Caligula and Nero in whom the julian line ended:—A veneration for the memory of Titus enabled his brother Domitian to sink the spirit of the world, and the divine Marcus Aurelius found that the lustre of his own virtues would frustrate every endeavour of his disinterested and patriot head, to set aside the election of that monster, his son, or rather his wife’s son Commodus; for Marcus Aurelius could never have been the father of such a son—and the latter end of this all-accomplished mortal, was embittered with the prospect, of the misery of his fellow citizens under the administration of a brute—As to hereditary chief magistrates, I perfectly agree with the Marquis Mirabeau, and what he says of France may be justly extended to the whole world—he says, if I recollect right, that in 1100 years there have been but four Princes on the French throne, that did not deserve the gallows.—In England, an Henry IId. was succeeded by a brute, a coward and a fool.—Richard, John and Henry—the valiant and just Edward the Ist. made way for the mean and despicable Edward IId—the Great Edward the IIId and [476]his adored son, the Black Prince, crowned the English throne with laurels to be lavished away by the profuse and injudicious hand of Richard IId—and the valiant Henry the Vth. transmitted his glory and authority to be tarnished by his weak son, Henry the sixth.—In fine, there is no general truth more fully established than, that human beings entrusted with power will abuse it—from the Prince who fills the throne, down to the degraded negro, who beats his poor plough-horses and oxen so unmercifully:—There is a humane and benevolent saying of an illustrious Prince, the Marshal Vendome, which deserves to be imprinted on our minds in indelible characters.—He said that in a long march he listened attentively to the quarrels between the muleteers and the mules, and that he found the mules always in the right—thus the possession and the abuse of power seem inseperably connected.4 The rule of any one man, who is elevated to a preheminence of power, is always surrounded by those vile minions and favorites, who bask in the sunshine of courts—deify the object of their adoration with the venal incense of flattery—intercept every avenue to truth, and who never can be satisfied until they reduce the people to the slavery of the ancient Persians—who, when their Prince ordered them to be well bastinadoed, were obliged to fall down upon their knees and say—We thank you most gracious Sovereign for deigning to recollect us.— But it will be asked can this happen in America?—My countrymen, you will yet discover before your day is cold, a truth long established by every political enquiry—that in all governments, in which there is sown the smallest seed of the rule of one man, no checks—no bars, can prevent its growing into a monarchy, or a despotism if the empire is extensive—And that to attempt to form a virtuous republic on the unqualified principles of representation is as vain as to expect a carriage to run with wheels only on one side.—Wheels will be added on the other, and the machine once set in motion down hill will never stop until it carries us to the bottom—then let us not set off without every necessary check. It is true the proposed national system guarantees to each State a republican form of government—Whoever will look into Coxe’s Northern Travels, will find that in the treaty whereby the three arch-despots of Russia, Germany and Prussia, divided that poor distracted country, Poland—they solemnly guarantee (in express words) to the said Poland—a republican government forever.5 (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,Luther Martin,,Maryland Journal,,4/4/1788,"To the CITIZENS of MARYLAND. If those, my fellow-citizens, to whom the administration of our government was about to be committed, had sufficient wisdom never to err, and sufficient goodness always to consult the true interest of the governed,—and if we could have a proper security that their successors should to the end of time be possessed of the same qualifications, it would be impossible that power could be lavished upon them with too liberal a hand. Power absolute and unlimited, united with unerring wisdom and unbounded goodness, is the government of the Deity over the universe!—But remember, my fellow-citizens, that the persons to whom you are about to delegate authority, are and will be weak, erring mortals, subject to the same passions, prejudices and infirmities with yourselves; and let it be deeply engraven on your hearts, that from the first history [481]of government to the present time, if we begin with Nimrod, and trace down the rulers of nations to those who are now invested with supreme power, we shall find few, very few, who have made the beneficent Governor of the Universe the model of their conduct, while many are they who, on the contrary, have imitated the demons of darkness. We have no right to expect that our rulers will be more wise, more virtuous, or more perfect than those of other nations have been, or that they will not be equally under the influence of ambition, avarice, and all that train of baleful passions, which have so generally proved the curse of our unhappy race. We must consider mankind such as they really are,—such as experience has shewn them to be heretofore, and bids us expect to find them hereafter, and not suffer ourselves to be misled by interested deceivers or enthusiastick visionaries; and therefore in forming a system of government, to delegate no greater power than is clearly and certainly necessary, ought to be the first principle with every people, who are influenced by reason and a regard for their safety, and in doing this, they ought most solicitously to endeavour so to qualify even that power, by such checks and restraints, as to produce a perfect responsibility in those who are to exercise it, and prevent them from its abuse with a chance of impunity;—since such is the nature of man, that he has a propensity to abuse authority and to tyrannize over the rights of his fellow-men;—and to whomsoever power is given, not content with the actual deposite, they will ever strive to obtain an increase. Those who would wish to excite and keep awake your jealousy and distrust, are your truest friends;—while they, who speak peace to you when there is no peace—who would lull you into security, and wish you to repose blind confidence in your future governors, are your most dangerous enemies.—Jealousy and distrust are the guardian angels who watch over liberty:—security and confidence are the forerunners of slavery. But the advocates for the system tell you that we who oppose it, endeavour to terrify you with mere possibilities, which may never be realized, that all our objections consist in saying government may do this,—and government may do that.— I will, for argument sake, admit the justice of this remark, and yet maintain that the objections are insurmountable.—I consider it an incontrovertible truth, that whatever by the constitution government even may do, if it relates to the abuse of power, by acts tyrannical and oppressive, it some time or other will do.—Such is the ambition of man, and his lust for domination, that no power less than that which fixed [482]its bounds to the ocean, can say, to them, “thus far shall ye go and no farther.”2—Ascertain the limits of the may, with ever so much precision, and let them be as extensive as you please, government will speedily reach their utmost verge; nor will it stop there, but soon will overleap those boundaries, and roam at large into the regions of the may not.—Those who tell you the government by this constitution may keep up a standing army,—abolish the trial by jury,—oppress the citizens of the states by its powers over the militia,—destroy the freedom of the press,—infringe the liberty of conscience, and do a number of other acts injurious to and destructive of your rights, yet that it never will do so; and that you safely may accept such a constitution, and be perfectly at ease and secure that your rulers will always be so good, so wise, and so virtuous—such emanations of the Deity, that they will never use their power but for your interest and your happiness—contradict the uniform experience of ages, and betray a total ignorance of human nature, or a total want of ingenuity. Look back, my fellow-citizens, to your conduct but a few years past, and let that instruct you what ought to be your conduct at this time. Great-Britain then claimed the right to pass laws to bind you in all cases whatever.3—You were then told in all the soft insinuating language of the present day, and with all the appearance of disinterested friendship now used, that those who insisted this claim of power might be abused, only wandered in the regions of fancy—that you need not be uneasy, but might safely acquiesce in the claim—that you might have the utmost possible confidence in your rulers, that they never would use that power to your injury;—but distrustful of government, and jealous of your liberty, you rejected such counsel with disdain;—the bare possibility that Britain might abuse it, if once conceded, kindled a flame from one end of this continent to the other, and roused you to arms—Weak and defenceless as you were, unused to military exertions, and unsupplied with warlike stores, you braved the strength of a nation the most powerful and best provided—you chose to risk your lives and property rather than to risque the possibility that the power claimed by the British government should be exercised to your injury—a possibility, which the minions of power at that time, with as much confidence as those of the present day, declared to be absolutely visionary. Heaven wrought a miracle in your favour, and your efforts were crowned with success. You are not now called upon to make an equal sacrifice—you are not now requested to beat your ploughshares into swords, or your pruning hooks into spears4—to leave your peaceful habitations, and exchange domestic tranquility for the horrors of war;—peaceably, quietly [483]and orderly to give this system of slavery your negative, is all that is asked by the advocates of freedom—to pronounce the single monosyllable no, is all they entreat;—shall they entreat you in vain?—when by this it is to be determined, whether our independence, for obtaining which we have been accustomed to bow the knee with reverential gratitude to Heaven, shall be our greatest curse;—and when on this it depends whether we shall be subjected to a government, of which the little finger will be thicker than the loins of that of Great-Britain.5 But there are also persons who pretend that your situation is at present so bad, that it cannot be worse, and urge that as an argument why we should embrace any remedy proposed, however desperate it may appear. Thus do the poor erring children of mortality, suffering under the presence of real or imaginary evils, have recourse to a pistol or halter for relief, and rashly launch into the untried regions of eternity—nor wake from their delusion, until they wake in endless wo[e].—Should the citizens of America, in a fit of desperation, be induced to commit this fatal act of political suicide, to which by such arguments they are stimulated, the day will come when labouring under more than Egyptian bondage, compelled to furnish their quota of brick, though destitute of straw and of mortar;6 galled with your chains, and worn down by oppression, you will, by sad experience, be convinced (when that conviction shall be too late) that there is a difference in evils, and that the buzzing of gnats is more supportable than the sting of a serpent. From the wisdom of antiquity we might obtain excellent instruction, if we were not too proud to profit by it—Aesop has furnished us with the history of a nation of Frogs7—between which and our own there is a most striking resemblance.—Whether the catastrophe shall be the same, rests with ourselves. Jupiter, out of pure good nature, wishing to do them as little injury as possible, on being asked for a King, had thrown down into their pond a Log to rule over them;—under whose government, had they been wise enough to know their own interest and to pursue it, they might, to this day, have remained happy and prosperous.—Terrified with the noise, and affrighted by the violent undulations of the water, they for some time kept an awful distance, and regarded their monarch with reverence; but the first impression being in some measure worn off, and perceiving him to be of a tame and peaceable disposition, they approached him with familiarity, and soon entertained for him the utmost contempt:—In a little time were seen the leaders of the Frogs croaking, to their respective circles, on the weakness and feebleness of the government at home, and of its want of dignity and respect abroad, [484]till the sentiment being caught by their auditors, the whole pond resounded with “Oh Jupiter, good Jupiter, hear our prayers—take away from us this vile Log, and give us a ruler who shall know how to support the dignity and splendor of government!—give us any government you please, only let it be energetic and efficient.”—The Thunderer, in his wrath, sent them a Crane. With what delight did they gaze on their Monarch, as he came majestically floating on the wings of the wind!—They admired his uncommon shape—it was such as they had never before seen—his deformities were, in their eyes, the greatest of beauties—and they were heard, like Aristides, to declare, that, were they on the verge of eternity, they would not wish a single alteration in his form8—His monstrous beak, his long neck, and his enormous poke—even these, the future means of their destruction, were subjects of their warm approbation.—He took possession of his new dominions, and instantly began to swallow down his subjects; and it is said, that those who had been the warmest zealots for Crane-administration, fared no better than the rest.—The poor wretches were now much more dissatisfied than before, and, with all possible humility, applied to Jupiter again for his aid, but in vain—he dismissed them with this reproof, “that the evil of which they complained, they had foolishly brought upon themselves, and that they had no other remedy now, but to submit with patience.”—Thus forsaken by the God, and left to the mercy of the Crane, they sought to escape his cruelty by flight; but pursuing them to every place of retreat, and thrusting his long neck through the water to the bottom, he drew them out with his beak from their most secret hiding-places, and served them up as a regale for his ravenous appetite. The present federal government is, my fellow-citizens, the Log of the fable—the Crane is the system now offered to your acceptance.—I wish you not to remain under the government of the one, nor to become subjected to the tyranny of the other.—If either of these events take place, it must arise from your being greatly deficient to yourselves, from your being, like the nation of Frogs, “a discontented, variable race, weary of liberty, and fond of change.”—At the same time I have no hesitation in declaring, that if the one or the other must be our fate, I think the harmless, inoffensive, though contemptible Log, infinitely to be preferred to the powerful, the efficient, but all-devouring Crane.

Here then we arrive at the summit of imperfection in human legislation—the magistrate whose will is law, is no longer restrained by the influence of manners—a regard to reputation or the desire of glory—the three ruling principles that guide the heart to virtue;—his own inclinations become the manners of the empire—establish reputation and fix the standard of fame.—Caius Cæsar, who was declared Imperator or Emperor of the Roman republic (a title in its most extensive signification meaning only a military commander in chief) was devoted to lust—A grave senate of Rome—that senate which twenty or indeed ten years before, had commanded the awe and veneration of mankind, [488]solemnly proposed a law, as Suetonius informs us, to submit their wives and daughters to his embraces2—it was his regard for the public reputation that alone forbad this sacrifice of the honor of the empire—the first Cæsar was a compound of the most exalted virtue and deepest vice—but the fact discovers what instantaneous change, the slightest alterations of government may create in the manners of a people—of a most enlightened and virtuous people—for the age of Julius Cæsar, was the age of Cicero, Cato, Brutus, Cassius and of all that noble but unfortunate band of conspirators.— But this furious passion which has celestial beauty for its object, soon banishes philosophy and moderation—even the glowing idea that gives all that is beautiful and amiable to our arms, makes the senses drunk with passion—What effects then must spring from the idea realized—all history informs us—the minds of all men, even the best unrestrained by their own, or the constitution of the State become inebriated with lust, from the times of David, the second chief magistrate of Israel—a man after God’s own heart—and his son Solomon—the wise, who had the moderate share of seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines—down to the amorous Charles, (who restored to the English throne, before the republican fever had cooled, or Presbyterian sanctity had relaxed) yet contrived to fill the English peerage with his bastards.—The nation made one jump from the cold pulpit of religion into the hot-bed of vice—This irresistible passion marked with celebrity the decemvirate of Rome—a tyranny established by the free suffrages of the people, in the infancy and most quiet and virtuous æra of the republic; because they took it into their heads that their old constitution and laws were not good enough, and therefore sent to Greece for new ones:—If in the six and twenty senators of America, some future Appius may be found, I yet trust from the high confidence I repose in my fair countrywomen, that for many years a Virginia will not be wanting to re-act the Roman tragedy;—but all human virtue is frail—What the senate intended by law for Julius Cæsar, the influence of manners provided for Octavius and his successors—Matrons and the beauties of the first rank of Rome esteemed it the highest honor to prostitute themselves to the artful Augustus, and even to such an infamous villain as Caligula:—The amorous dispositions of a succession of Princes, have rendered the present of the handkerchief the highest honor, to which female beauty and merit could aspire in the seraglio of Constantinople, and in the courts of the two Lewises—who preceded the present amiable and virtuous monarch of France; yet they were rewarded with implicit obedience,[489] and Lewis the 16th meets with turbulence and resistance in his most meritorious acts:—Virtue only breeds confusion in perverted government.—Whoever will read what the pens of Suetonius and Tacitus have described, will be lost in admiration at the original and surpassing wickedness to which Rome arrived in less than half a century—But can these things happen to the Americans? What distinguishes the Americans, from the French—the Germans—the Turks or the Persians?—America is in a great measure peopled by emigrants from the old countries, now enthralled in slavery—Does crossing the atlantic alter the nature of these people?—Let our countrymen reflect on this awful truth, that nothing creates that wide distinction between them, and the white slaves of the old world, or indeed their black slaves here, but their government—Let them consider this well, and they will be rendered cautious how they change it—(bad as it is) for new imported constitutions—Amalgomated as we were with a corrupt old monarchy—with the combined corruptions of three armies—a constant communication with the luxurious and debauched capitals of the old world—we cannot be surprised, that some of our great cities are now ripe for any thing.—These remarks are intended for the thinking part of our citizens, and particularly those who are most active in promoting this revolution.—In the most important characters of this class of men, the author has great confidence:—America has more to dread from the want of information than the want of integrity in her rulers; and her own precipitation is the most dreadful of all. People should be liberal of every thing but power—but to give away an atom of their liberties is as criminal as dishonorable. However degrading and disgraceful the state of society just described may be—worse as it is far then ten thousand deaths to a feeling and delicate mind—yet to the mass of the people it is not so afflicting as the loss of the other moral virtues, which in large governments, are exchanged for the fashionable vices of him who presides:—Under Caligula, the Roman legions were not ashamed to adorn their helmets with cockle-shells in triumph for their expedition against Britain, in which, they never ventured to leave the shores of Gaul—this Prince—the degenerate son of the adored Germanicus, happened to be a poltron.—During the reign of Nero, fiddling—dancing—singing—burning cities—plundering States—perfidy and assassination were the manners of the age, and discover the motley mind of this monster of levity and vice.—Domitian who like every man that from weakness—vicious heart—or the allurements of pleasure, deserts the paths of virtue—hated cordially those examples of merit which he could not imitate. [490]Tacitus informs us, that during his life—virtue became a death warrant—Philosophy fled—Pliny sat himself down quietly to compose a grammar—the only work of science then safe—in short, nothing was honourable or profitable but assassinations, informations, and all sorts of corruptions and pollutions.

Newspaper,No,John Calvin,,Maryland Journal,,4/8/1788,"Copy of a Letter of JOHN CALVIN to MARTIN LUTHER—shortly after the General Council of Trent, held Anno Dom. 1563.2 Dear Luther, In this dawn of the day of reformation, permit me, in the name and behalf of all the faithful, to congratulate you on your success, or at least the happy prospect thereof, in the glorious opposition you have made, and still continue to make, to the last tyrannical, apostatical, diabolical General Council. With what language shall I express, my dear fellow-worker in this labour of love, the high and sacred sense which all the reformed of our community entertain of thy fervent zeal, and undaunted resolution in withstanding, and combating with true christian fortitude and heroism the united powers of Antichrist! The glorious testimony you have thereby manifested to the world in general, and those under your own pastoral instruction in particular, of thy uncontaminated sanctity, and incorruptible integrity in the common cause of christian freedom, must and will secure thee the confidence and veneration of all thy true believers to the latest posterity. Your guarded vigilance through every stage of that important business committed to your charge, and that indefatigable industry wherewith thou wast inspired to resist the combined powers of darkness, may prove, manifestly prove even to this wicked and perverse generation, that thou hast spoken, “not with the tongue of man,” from the light of human reason, nor even those sacred records thou so industriously procured from the church of Philadelphia;3 but evidently by the immediate, infusive inspiration of that miraculous power, that influences all your [492]undertakings, and by which you still continue to exhibit to the world those oratorical abilities, and that sacred knowledge wherein thou so superlatively aboundest to the subversion of iniquity, the maintenance of truth, and the establishment of those laws, founded on the eternal equity and fitness of things, which are absolutely requisite for supporting good government, distributing justice, and securing the temporal and eternal interests of human society. Should not our hearts, my beloved brother, rejoice with exultation, and the sincerest gratitude to that arm of omnipotence, which hath exalted us to the dignified office of enlightening and reforming the church militant? What although you and I differ as to some little, trifling, non-important non-essentials; yet, we are, and that to the woful mortification of our enemies, decidedly agreed in our endeavours to extirpate, overwhelm, and totally suppress a system, an erroneous, damnable, and condemnably consolidated system of corporal and spiritual tyranny. Surely our grateful souls ought to exult in strains of enraptured congratulation, that, not only so many able advocates have been added to our holy faith, and reformed doctrine; but that also an opportunity hath been afforded us, and that by the most unmolested and secret combination during the very session of the Council, of forming a divine junto to oppose and disappoint the ambitious, interested, enslaving, infernal designs of that synagogue of Satan. Be it moreover matter of rejoicing to us, that our truly well-beloved brother of the church of Massachusitia, the powerful apostle of the church of Virginia,4 and your disciple of Carolina,5 have with the most zealous industry spread, promulgated, and diffused among all ranks, such a spirit of uncontrolable resistance, that a very considerable number of proselytes have been thereby secured: And that, if no insidious, infernal machination thwart our joint endeavours, such multitudes shall be daily added to the faithful, as must in the end, sap, overthrow, and utterly erase that Babylonic Tower6 of error and confusion, never more to rear it’s monstrous head, till that curst hierarchy which raised it be totally swept from the summit of their hopes. Justice, indeed, requires that they should be for ever extirpated from among those whom they wished to rule, not with the lenient sceptre of licentiousness; but with that iron rod of oppression, that intolerable yoke of ceremonies, that accursed accumulation of order and economy, which “neither we nor our fathers are able to bear.”7 May we not, my right reverend friend, verily persuade ourselves, that the miraculous power hath not yet entirely forsaken the church: Otherwise, how could it ever have entered into the heart of man to conceive, that such, comparatively speaking, impotent instruments should have presumed, [493]secretly or avowedly presumed, to oppose such a formidable host of confederated, antichristian oppressors! O glorious opposition! O thou unlimited prerogative of the people! O tempora et mores!8 Well may I be allowed to exclaim in the words of the prophane poet of old, tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur ab illis!9 What but the marvellous interposition of Heaven, could gain us, who are less “than a drop in the bucket,” or, “a grain of dust on the balance,”10 the smallest credit, in opposition to the united wisdom of the world! But thus seemeth it good unto him, who “by the foolishness of preaching shall save such as believe.”11 Notwithstanding, these sentiments are engraven in indelible characters on the tablet of my heart; yet I must confess, when I considered, that generally, in all sacred or civil controversies, it was only reasonable to expect that mankind, especially in it’s present state of iniquitous apostacy, would rely with greater confidence on the judgment of those dignified, and sanctified sages, who had so long maintained over them a spiritual authority, and might be said to have spent their lives in their service, and consequently, had obtained the most competent knowledge of the laws of nature and revelation, of justice and equity, of civil and ecclesiastic government—I say, when I indulged this reflection, and also considered that even I myself would have expected that any of my adherents would, or at least should, have perferred consulting me on any controverted case of conscience, to an unskilled, inexperienced under-graduate, I must declare that nothing prevented me from totally despairing of a single proselyte, but that unseen power which hath hitherto so singularly displayed it’s miraculous efficacy in our favour, and enabled us to view, though “darkly as through a glass,”12 some distant prospect of our labours being crowned with success, by a general adoption of those salutary sentiments which we have so uniformly, disinterestedly, and piously professed to the world. Permit me to add, for the further information and confirmation of those happy souls who reside under the refreshing dew of thy instructive influence, another proof of the present existing miraculous power of the church. A few days after the publication of the tenets, resolutions, &c. of the late General Council, I was present, where a person of credit, and a worthy member of the church of Virginia, was so suddenly and surprisingly filled by an infusion of some divine inspiration, as to predict and openly declare the names of such distinguished characters in that church, as would reject the heresy of the Council, and embrace our principles of reformation. Knowing him to be no partizan of ours, but “an alien from the commonwealth of Israel,”13 I was the more amazed, and being convinced he had neither time nor opportunity of acquiring any information of their sentiments, I waited with anxiety to know the event of [494]this unaccountable prediction, and was truly astonished, though agreeably surprised, to find it perfectly verified, beyond the possibility of a future doubt. Gloria patri, filio et spiritui sancto!14—exclaimed I, how wonderful are all thy ways! In the last public declaration of thy creed, or rather justification of the faithful discharge of that sacred office whereunto thou wast set apart and ordained, I am at a loss whether most to admire thy profound and extensive knowledge, fervent zeal, or prudent vigilance. Thou hast certainly been a “faithful labourer in thy master’s vineyard.”15 Thou hast been diligent “in season and out of season”16—“through good report and bad report:”17 And shouldst therefore, without being charged with ambition, inherit that golden crown, “which soon fadeth not away.”18—Sceptical fools may suspect thy sincerity—ambitious knaves envy thy abilities—or hypocritical scribblers arraign thy integrity—But let not these, my venerable brother, abate ought of thy pious ardour, or prevent thee from continuing the exhibition of that public procession of testimonies, which thou hast successively, and so zealously borne to the truth of that sacred cause, wherein thou art engaged. Alarmed for the safety of a life so invaluable as thine, you cannot conceive, how much I dreaded the consequence of your bold and open assertion of the interested, ambitious, and consequently treacherous intentions of the General Council. I concluded, you had not reflected that it was held under the auspices of that pious, political, philosophical POPE,19 whose invaluable services in the church, a majority of the people must revere, as long as they retain the smallest spark of gratitude, and more especially when honoured by the concurring sentiments of that patriotic immortal CHAMPION of his country,20 whose apotheosis, I am afraid, all our reforming principles will scarce be able to restrain, in this present evil, corrupt and idolatrous generation. I was, however, happily relieved from any apprehensions of your thereby incurring any personal danger from the incensed resentment of an infidel world, when I found you had very prudently administered an exceedingly proper and necessary salvo, in an elegant, sublime, and exalted panegyric on the hospitality you had experienced from the one, and the unparalleled patriotism, virtue, and matchless bravery of the other. That truly christian-like prayer, which, by way of coup de main,21 you offered up for the eternal duration of their terrestrial and celestial honour and happiness, may clearly discover to a censorious world, the liberal, charitable and benevolent tendency of your purifying principles. Conscious as I am thereof, how can I observe but with indignation, the groundless charges lately brought against you by a certain Landholding, world-clinging incendiary from the court of Belzebub22—boldly [495]and blasphemously arraigning the integrity of thy heart, and scandalously reviling thee with the opprobious epithets of heretic, schismatic, soporific dispenser, &c. &c. Poor sinner! little was he aware of the vengeance of thy resistless arm; or he never would have drawn a weapon which he knew not how to use, but to his destruction—Little did he dream, that thou wast so compleatly furnished with the armour of Heaven—or that thou couldst sink him and his cause in everlasting shame and confusion, with that endless, resistless, never to be consumed artillery, wherewith thou hast vanquished, beaten down, and eternally silenced the envious, inveterate and fiery batteries of all thine enemies. It hath been the unhappy lot of the righteous in all ages of the church, to be hunted after by that roaring Lion and his Jackalls, who roam about seeking whom they may devour. But let us comfort ourselves with the reflection, that, “wherever our treasure is, there shall our hearts be also:”23 And that through these, or that which defendeth, upholdeth, and strengtheneth us, we are perfectly secure against all the frowns of malevolence—death of governments—hell of tyrants—and grave of constitutions. There is indeed, only one incident, or rather precedent, that offers the least alarm to my apprehensions on your, or my own account, and that is, the dreadful, excruciating, yet glorious martyrdom of John Huss, and Jerome of Prague24—It is true, that their example, undaunted resolution, and unshaken fortitude through such undescribable tortures, may for a moment spread a tremor through our timid frames of mortality, at the apprehension of their being “offered up as burning sacrifices on the live coals of the altar.”25 Yet should it ever be our lot, so to honour that heavenly cause, to which we shall firmly adhere, at the expence, or hazard of life and fortune, let us comfort ourselves with the assurance, that like gold seven times purified, we shall emerge, and be exalted with distinguished lustre amidst the innumerable, admiring myriads of Elysium. In the mean time, however, it is only doing your merits justice, to have it celebrated through all the Christian Churches, united in the same common bond of interest and affection, how conspicuously evident the favour of Heaven hath been, in raising up, in this our dark day of degeneracy, such a luminary of instruction, for the comfort, information, and edification of all who believe in thy name. In this we are confirmed by the manifest verification of the following prediction, namely, “that out of the ashes of a Huss, (in the Bohemian language signifying a Goose) a Phenix or Successor, should arise, the virtuous offspring of whom, no earthly power should ever exterminate. From the late specimen of thy pious, unwearied exertions in defence of the truth, is not, my dear Luther, the prophecy plainly [496]verified in thee? Hast thou not proved, manifestly, indubitably, and identically proved thyself the genuine offspring of the immortal Huss? Yes, verily thou art, avis ejusdem ovum, “an egg of the same bird,” filius es patris, “a chip of the old block,” or, anseris ejusdem anserculus.26 Finally, my beloved brother in the Lord, I cannot conclude this, I am afraid, too tedious epistle, without expressing the regret of my soul that the deluded Council, from which thou excommunicated thyself, listened not to the heavenly sound of salvation which issued from thy lips—that they were not illuminated with a portion of that effulgent light which shone around thee in meridian splendor, to the enlightening of their benighted understandings—happy! thrice happy! had it then been for us and our posterity!—But, my dear Martin, let us content ourselves with the consciousness of having faithfully discharged our duty—let us exhort each other, and those of our community, to contemn the slanderous insinuations of our enemies—There being little doubt but that we may incur, at least for a time, the reproaches of an ignorant and perverse world, so long as the restless powers of Satan combine in maintaining their influence over our poor deluded brethren. Regardless of the insidious machinations of secret or open enemies, let us, as faithful stewards of the word, “persevere in adding to our faith Fortitude, to Fortitude Patience, and to Patience Hope,”27 in as much as we are well assured that “our labour will not be in vain:”28—But, that when this fluctuating scene of perturbation subsides, to the exaltation of that kingdom, which we have been labouring to establish, we may sit down on the right hand of power, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and all the other glorious members of the Church Triumphant—Such are the heavenly hopes of thy brother in the true Christian Spirit of Love and Affection. Geneva."

Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,4/11/1788,"(Continued from our last) Human misery is wound up to its highest pitch in this last stage of corruption, to which the social union can arrive:—At length the poor, wretched beings, who, let whatever be the change, and in every preceding gradation of government, have invariably fallen from bad to worse—turn their weary eyes, from a world which presents so frightful a prospect—to the world of hope,—the kingdom that is to come hereafter—the only solace and comfort of those who are miserable here;—there all the fond images of equality, which men are fated ever to retain, are once more revived—Scenes of never-ending bliss are painted in the most delightful colours—the imagination grows warm with the prospect—mad with the hopes of celestial happiness, the souls of all men seem anxious to take their flight, to their Omnipotent Author—the Sovereign Legislator of nature—who, peerless and above all, dispences equal law to willing minds:—The people flock in crouds to hear preachers—who, exalted by the presence of numerous and passionate audiences, are elevated into flights of native eloquence, surpassing the strains of the most studied oratory:—The people mind nothing but preaching; the things of this miserable world, are despised when put in competition with the joys of Paradise—agriculture is neglected—famine ensues—government is at length roused for want of plunder and a supply of luxuries—the sword of coercion is drawn—but it increases the phrenzy—One martyr makes fifty converts—such was the first rise of the Christian religion, as it is exactly and pathetically described by the historic pen of Ammianus Marcellinus:2—The empire torn by intestine convulsions becomes an easy prey to any bold invader. Thus it is that the barbarity—cruelty and blood which stain the history of religion, spring from the corruption of civil government, and from that never-dying hope and fondness for a state of equality, which [505]constitutes an essential part of the soul of man:—A chaos of darkness obscures the downfal of empire, intermixed with gleams of light, which serve only to disclose scenes of desolation and horror—From the last confusion springs order:—The bold spirits who pull down the ancient fabric—erect a new one, founded on the natural liberties of mankind, and where civil government is preserved free, there can be no religious tyranny—the sparks of bigotry and enthusiasm may and will crackle, but can never light into a blaze.— The truth of these remarks appear from the histories of those two great revolutions of European government, which seem to have convulsed this earth to the centre of its orb, and of which we have compleat record—The Roman and the Gothic, or as it is more commonly called the feudal constitution:—In the infancy of the Roman republic, when enterprizing and free, their conquests were rapid, because beneficial to the conquered (who were admitted to a participation of their liberty) their religion, although devoid, was not only unstained by persecution, but censurably liberal—they received without discrimination the Gods of the countries they subdued, into the list of their deities, until Olympus was covered with an army of demigods as numerous as the legions of Popish Saints; and we find the Grecian divinities adored with more sincere piety at Rome, than at Athens.—Rome was then in the zenith of her glory—in the days of her wretched decline—in the miserable reigns of Caracalla, Eliagabalus and Commodus.—Ammianus and others, inform us that the Christians were butchered like sheep, for reviving the old exploded doctrine of a future state, in which Emperors and Senators were to be placed on a level with the poorest and most abject of mankind:—And in the succeeding despotisms when christianity became the established religion, it grew immediately as corrupt in its infancy, as ever it has proved at any period since—the most subtle disquisitions of a metaphysical nature became the universal rage—the more incomprehensible—the more obstinately were they maintained, and in fine, the canonized Austin or Ambrose, (I forget which) closed his laborious enquiries, with this holy position—that he believed, because it was impossible.3 At length the great question, whether the three persons of the divinity, were three or one, became publickly agitated, and threw all mankind into a flame—Councils after councils, composed of all the wisdom of the divines, were assembled, and at length the doctrine that three were one prevailed, and such would have been the determination had it been proposed that three were sixteen—because misery is the foundation, upon which error erects her tyranny over the vulgar mind.—After this determination the arm of the Magistrate was called in, and those poor misled Arians who were still so wicked as to [506]imagine that three must be three, were not only declared guilty of a most abominable and damnable heresy, but were thenceforth exterminated by fire and sword. In the first age of the Gothic government, those free and hardy adventurers, deserted their Idols and embraced the doctrines of Christianity with ardent sincerity:—The King and a large majority of a nation, would be converted and baptized with as much celerity as the ceremony could be performed—but still liberty in the temporal, secured freedom in the spiritual administration: Christians and Pagan citizens lived together in the utmost harmony—Those bold and hardy conquerors would never listen to Bishops who advised persecution, and held in sovereign contempt all those metaphysical distinctions with which a pure religion has been disgraced, in order to cloak villainous designs and support artful usurpations of civil powers in feeble and turbulent governments. The Gothic institutions were however much sooner corrupted from internal vices than the Roman, and the undeniable reason was, that in the former, government by representation was admitted almost coeval with their first inundations;—whereas with the Romans, the democratic branch of power, exercised by the people personally, rendered them invinsible both in war and peace—the virtue of this internal institution could only be subdued by the greatness of its external acquisition—extensive empire ruined this mighty fabric—a superstructure, which overshadowed the then known world, was too mighty for the foundation confined within the walls of a city—the wealth imported by the Scipios from Spain and Afric[a], and by Flaminius, Lucullus, Sylla and Pompey, from the East, enabled the few to corrupt the many—a case that can never exist but where the legislative power resides exclusively in the citizens of the town—The Roman republic then became diseased at the heart, but as it was ages in forming, so it required ages of corruption to destroy a robust constitution where every atom was a nerve: It was not so with the Gothic constitution, mortal disease soon made its appearance there—Civil liberty was early destroyed by the insolence and oppressions of the great—The temporal power availed itself of that spiritual influence which nature has given religion over the hearts of men—A religion, the divinity of which is demonstrable by reason alone, unassisted by revelation became the corrupt instrument of usurpation.—Those who were the authors of the disorders which disgraced civil government, cut the reins of ecclesiastical persecution: And an universal and tyrannic confusion was mingled with absurdities that excite both ridicule and horror. We see a Duke of Gandia (who was betrayed and assassinated by that monster of perfidy [507]Cæsar Borgia, the bastard of the infamous Pope Alexander the VIth) in the last moments of his existence, begging the cut throat son, that he would intercede with his father, the Pope, in favour of his poor soul, that it might not be kept long in purgatory, but dispatched as soon as possible to Heaven, to dispute the infallibility of those vice-gerents of God, who generally patterned after the devil, was considered as an heresy more damnable than blaspheming the most high. Religious tyranny continued in this state, during those convulsions which broke the aristocracies of Europe, and settled their governments into mixed monarchies: A ray of light then beamed—but only for a moment—the turbulent state and quick corruption of mixed monarchy, opened a new scene of religious horror—Pardons for all crimes committed and to be committed, were regulated by ecclesiastical law, with a mercantile exactitude, and a Christian knew what he must pay for murdering another better than he now does the price of a pair of boots: At length some bold spirits began to doubt whether wheat flour, made into paste, could be actually human flesh, or whether the wine made in the last vintage could be the real blood of Christ, who had been crucified upwards of 1400 years—Such was the origin of the Protestant reformation—at the bare mention of such heretical and dangerous doctrine, striking (as they said) at the root of all religion, the sword of power leaped from its scabbard, the smoke that arose from the flames, to which the most virtuous of mankind, were without mercy committed, darkened all Europe for ages; tribunals, armed with frightful tortures, were every where erected, to make men confess opinions, and then they were solemnly burned for confessing, whilst priest and people sang hymns around them; and the fires of persecution are scarcely yet extinguished. Civil and religious liberty are inseparably interwoven—whilst government is pure and equal—religion will be uncontaminated:—The moment government becomes disordered, bigotry and fanaticism take root and grow—they are soon converted to serve the purposes of usurpation, and finally, religious persecution reciprocally supports and is supported by the tyranny of the temporal powers.

Newspaper,No,Neckar,,Maryland Gazette,Insolvent,4/11/1788,"Neckar commiserates any Insolvent; but would advise the one in Mr. Goddard’s paper, of the 1st instant, to read a little more attentively, before he bounces; or, if he be really as he signs himself, his friends may begin to think his insolvency more owing to bouncing than misfortune. Neckar has not in any manner implied, that the provision in the new system which says—“All debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before its adoption, shall be as valid against the United States, under this constitution, as under the confederation, abolishes all obligations upon the States respectively to pay their parts.” But he contends that the new system has not any provision for the collection of arrearages due from the several States whilst under the confederation. The clause quoted by Insolvent makes no such provision, it relates only to public claims against the United States. But the clause, art. 1st, sect. 2d, directly precludes any future provision being made. “Representation and direct taxes, shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers,” &c. Under this clause would Congress attempt to lay a tax of ten shillings extra on the hundred pounds in the State of Georgia, for the purpose of clearing off the arrearages of that State? The experiment would be attended with too much risque; and there can be no doubt that such States as are in arrears, do expect by the new system, to be exempted from any particular requisition hereafter, on account of them. Insolvent must be very young, or his mind much deranged from his situation; else he would have known that it is possible for a peace, suddenly negotiated, to be productive of calamitous consequences to many individuals; although the event may be desirable by the community at large. Insolvent might refine upon a refinement on Blair; this could not with propriety transfer the quality, “antifederal,” from the person to the thing—However, as it may be requisite for him to begin the world again with some reputation, he is heartily welcome to all he may have acquired from his display of criticism and eke his wit.—The substance of Neckar’s allegations is not in the least removed by either; nor would any part of Insolvent’s performance, as such, have been deemed worthy the notice of Neckar, had it not been thought that some people might, from the insinuation of Insolvent, be betrayed into a belief that the new system had made provision for a collection of arrearages—The fact is, it has not.—As small wits—like small fry, must feed, Insolvent may perhaps collect another repast out of this little sketch—He is at liberty to take [509]his fill—But he who will risk Neck or Nothing, for trifling gratifications, is in too desperate a situation to merit any attention hereafter, from NECKAR April 5, 1788."

Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,4/15/1788,"(Continued from our last.) Although both civil and political liberty may be truly said no longer to exist in Europe—yet from one effect of the feudal institutions, that enlightened part of the globe, has in a great measure, recovered from the disorders occasioned by their irreparable loss:—What I allude to is the division of that quarter of the world into a multitude of separate States and sovereignties, and that extreme attention to the preservation of each and to the balance of power, which has become a fundamental law of the whole; this secures the influence of political moderation, or a species of federal liberty, which is the next blessing that government can afford; and certainly were wise men obliged to confine themselves to the choice of one alternative—federal or national liberty—they would prefer the former—whilst the influence of that exists, it must support the substance in a great measure of the latter, although the forms should no longer remain—But when that ceases, national liberty, which includes both civil and political freedom, must soon expire.—The history of mankind furnishes a series of invariable and frightful examples of this.—The Roman republic included a variety of other republics, States and Kingdoms living in a perfect liberty, and according [517]to their own laws; this variety and contrariety of interests seemed to promise internal freedom, independent of external influence—But the time of their delirium had arrived—after the conquest of Hannibal and the peace which the first Scipio made with the Carthaginians—that immortal statesman and hero gave his countrymen this remarkable advice—to restore Carthage, as an enemy worthy of Rome—but the opinion of that stupid old fool Cato, the censor, prevailed as more consonant to the vulgar level of mens’ judgments, and delenda est Carthage—Carthage must be destroyed, became the motto of the day—the consequence of this political advice was, that Carthage being razed to the ground, and no enemy existing contiguous to Rome, which she could dread—not all her internal institutions—not all the variety of interests, which a multitude of almost independant States afforded, could prevent her speedy destruction—ruit mote fed—she fell by her own weight—and their liberty became such liberty as a Nero and the praetorian bands thought fit to distribute.—The Turkish empire is at this day extended over a multitude of kingdoms, States—even democratic and aristocratic republics, oligarchies, and every species of institution which the inventive genius of man has created—but I do not see that it has moderated its despotism.—Spain still contains in her bosom that very extensive and well formed republic Biscay—but the slavery of Spain has since the reign of Charles the Vth, nearly depopulated the finest part of Europe.—France contains an extensive free country, which would not submit to the general government but on conditions that have hitherto secured them a superior degree of happiness—I mean Britany, which was annexed to the crown by the marriage of Anne, of Bretagne, with Lewis the VIIth. There was a democracy until lately within the territory of France, Marseilles—A French gentleman once told me, we had one republic in France, which made one very great noise, at last the King he did build one little citadel in the middle of it, and then he teach them republicans how to behave themselves—The melancholy truth is, that the internal institutions of an extensive empire signify nought—the principle that the convenience, the rights and interests of a part must give way to what is called the good of the whole, unhinges every species of just and equal government, because it is a principle that has no limits. Still however the division of Europe into small independant States, preserves a degree of social happiness very different from what exists in other parts of the world—we find them injured by foreign war—but the moderation of a political influence exempts them from the desolations of those internal commotions which lay waste two extensive empires—Their wars too are becoming more mild and less frequent than formerly, and certainly if they could not be entirely prevented, [518]they might be quickly suppressed by keeping up an annual Congress of diplomatique ministers, instead of their present imperfect mode of negociation, which defective as it is, has notwithstanding rendered peace more durable, and war less destructive; the only satisfactory reason their greatest patriots have given for neglecting, what at first view appears so important an improvement, is that terror with which they justly view, any thing in the shape of general government, which they universally admit to be the greatest curse that can befal mankind:—The enlightened statesmen of the old world, have imprinted on their minds the wisdom of the ancient fable, which I shall now repeat to the Americans—“The lion, the king of the beasts, gave out that he was sick—he confined himself to his den, and his friends did not stick out to say that he must die of that disorder—all the beasts went to pay their court and assist him but the fox—at length the lion appeared abroad and took Reynard roundly to task, why he had not come to see him, when he was so ill—the fox, who in fable is the emblem of wisdom, made this memorable reply—In truth I did intend to pay my respects to your majesty, but when I came near your den, I saw all the feet pointing in and none coming out”2—So invariably have powers been travelling to the centre, never again to return to those who bestow them. At present as a recompence for the evils of occasional broils, Europe has the consolation to reflect, that she is secure from the terrible despotisms which reign over the other three quarters of the globe.—Those States who admit the sanction of the laws of nature and nations form as it were a great federal republic, and the balance of power, even under an imperfect system, has prevented those great revolutions and shocks which sweeping myriads of mortals at a blow, degrade mankind in the eye of philosophy, to a level with the ants and other insects of the earth—negociation unnerves the arm of conquest, and the genius of a Marlbrough, an Eugene, a Saxe and Turenne, is displayed in harmless countermarches, which in Asia, or even Europe, some centuries back, would have formed an Alexander, a Caesar, a Gengis Khan and a Tamerlane. To this balance of power, France has long owed her safety, and that only can save her at this particular and awful crisis of turbulence; the despotism of Constantinople would soon reign at Paris, but that the territory of France is not sufficiently large for such a tyranny, and she is surrounded by numerous, warlike and independant sovereignties—the influence of manners, which their philosophers boast of, as one great security, if not ironically introduced, is certainly but an empty sound—their manners—reputation and every thing, have been long regulated by the capricious vices of the Prince who sat on the throne—but [519]France is not sufficiently extensive to defend her empire by such immense deserts, as surround the despotisms of Turkey, Persia, China and Morocco, and secure them from foreign conquest—If the Prince, in France, was to destroy all their fundamental laws, which by what they now call their constitution, he evidently may do and subject his subjects to the caprice of a Turkish yoke, which 200,000 standing troops will accomplish for him whenever he pleases:—The inevitable consequence would be, that he would only subject himself and his slaves to instant conquest and partition among his neighbours.—No Prince of France will therefore ever be permitted to attempt this, whilst the present balance of power remains.

Letter,No,,,Independent Gazetteer,,4/17/1788,"Extract of a letter from Maryland, dated April 11. “The election for four members to represent the county of Harford in the convention, to meet at Annapolis on the 21st inst. to decide on the new constitution, was closed yesterday about five o’clock in the afternoon, when the poll stood as follows: William Paca, esquire, late governor of the state	41 John Love, esquire 413 William Pinckney, esquire Luther Martin, esquire, Attorney General 10 B. Rumsey, esquire, chief judge of the court of appeals Aquila Hall, esquire 65 John Archer, esquire 60 B. E. Hall, esquire, one of the senators  The first four candidates pledged themselves to the electors, that if chosen they would never assent to the proposed constitution unless such amendments as are necessary to secure and preserve the rights of the respective states and of their citizens shall be previously obtained; the others declared themselves for adopting the system and endeavouring afterwards to procure the necessary amendments: the poll was kept open four days to give these last four gentlemen an opportunity of discovering how many of their county-men concurred with them in opinion. Mr. Martin only arrived in Harford county on Saturday evening before the election, and meeting the electors on Monday morning at the place where the election was held, N. D. McComass, esquire, one of the candidates, with a liberality of sentiment which will ever do him honor, declined, in order that Mr. Martin might be elected for that county. On yesterday evening also the election ended for Baltimore county at the close of which the poll stood as follows: Charles Ridgley, esquire	 676 Charles Ridgley, of William, esq. 673 Edward Cockey, esquire Nathan Cromwell, esquire 627 Harry Dorsey Gough, esquire 192 James Gettings, esquire 183 John Eager Howard, esq. 172 John Cradock, esq. 171 The same opposition of sentiment existed and was declared between the candidates for Baltimore county, as between those of Harford. The great and decided majority, in each county, in favour of the candidates who declared in opposition to the new constitution, must evince to the world, in the strongest manner, the sense of those two counties. I am also this moment informed by good authority, that the friends of the proposed system have received a total defeat in Anne Arundel county, and that on the close of that poll there was a majority in favour of Jeremiah Townley Chase, Samuel Chase, John F. Mercer, and Benjamin Harrison, esquires, who firmly concur in sentiment with the members for Baltimore and Harford counties.”"

Your attack, Publius, on Mr. Chase, the other representative for this town, is explicit, and attended with the facts on which you ground your accusation, and therefore, as it affords the means of defence, it merits the acknowledgment of that gentleman, and his friends.—It is the right of every constituent to examine the public conduct of his representative, and if he violates his honor or faith, or deceives or betrays the trust and confidence reposed in him, it becomes a duty to drag him before the tribunal of the public, and there detect and expose him to the indignation and resentment of his constituents. His guilt being proved, contempt and infamy should light on his name, and he should be discarded from his trust with every mark of disgrace, by his virtuous and deluded countrymen—But remember, Publius, that justice demands, that the constituents should be fully convinced of the truth of the facts alledged, before they pass judgment against the honor, veracity, or fidelity of their representative. The first reflection that occurs to the considerate and impartial mind, on reading your accusation, Publius, will be this—that the charge may be false, and may proceed from some mistake or misconception, or it may be false, and may flow from design and malice;—that you, Publius, may be a good citizen, and actuated by worthy motives and patriotic principles; or that you may be the servile scribbler and base tool of a discontented and restless party in this town.—Whether your head or your heart is in fault will be decided after an examination into your charges against Mr. Chase. For the love of truth and justice I wish, Publius, that the inhabitants of Baltimore-town would enquire into the facts you state as charges against the honor and fidelity of Mr. Chase. This gentleman has filled the most important stations of trust in this country for a great number of years; though often accused his enemies never could maintain any one charge against him that could in any manner effect his honor, veracity, candour, or integrity. Mr. Chase has been a representative of the people for five and twenty years, and you, Publius, are the first person that ever called in question his fidelity to his constituents. It is possible, Publius, for a man by deception and cunning to obtain the good opinion and confidence of his county for many years, but it is not probable. A long life of public and private probity affords a presumption in favour of the accused, but facts when established, must [550]prevail against this presumption. If, Publius, you can support your charges against Mr. Chase, you will merit, for your patriotism and manly spirit, the approbation and thanks of your fellow-citizens, but if it should appear, that you have falsely and maliciously traduced his character, you will deserve the contempt, and, if discovered, you will incur the resentment of every virtuous inhabitant in the State.—Reputation, Publius, to a good man, is as dear to him as life itself, and the man who robs another of his good name would steal his purse if he could do it with safety. I shall with freedom, and I hope with candour, examine your accusations against Mr. Chase. You allege, Publius, “that before the last election, the confidential friends of Mr. Chase, always asserted, that he was entirely federal, and for adopting the new government as it came from the hands of the convention.” You state this fact, Publius, to induce the public to believe, that the friends of Mr. Chase made this declaration of his sentiments to procure votes in his favour at the last election, and that the voters of this town were deceived by this conduct of his friends.—Is your assertion, Publius, true or false? You publish it with the impudence of a New-Gate Solicitor, and with the gravity of a Divine. It would be painful to give the direct lie to a gentleman, but no terms are too gross to contradict so infamous a falsehood published by an anonymous writer, who is not entitled to the forms and ceremony, which politeness has established in the intercourse between gentlemen. The fact, Publius, you[r] charge is, from its nature, of public notoriety, and evidence cannot be wanting to ascertain it if true.—Produce your proof, Publius, of such declarations by any one of Mr. Chase’s friends to any person in the world, or stand recorded as a vile slanderer, with the wicked intention of destroying the reputation of your neighbours. Mr. Chase has too much knowledge and experience of the world to have many confidential friends; and the few he has are gentlemen of too much integrity and honor to say the thing that is not. If, Publius, you could produce any one to prove your allegation you would nevertheless miss your mark, as no reflection would fall on Mr. Chase, unless you could also prove, that such declaration was made with his knowledge and consent. You assert, Publius, “that Mr. Chase’s repeated declarations exactly corresponded with his friends reports of his principles, that he was entirely federal, and for adopting the new government, as it came from the hands of the convention; and that in consequence of these declarations the inhabitants of Baltimore-town judged him worthy of a seat in the legislature.”—Blush, Publius—blush, if possible, for publishing so impudent, so notorious a falsehood, in the open day.—You read the decalogue, Publius, perhaps you teach it—“Thou shalt not bear false [551]witness against thy neighbour.”3 “Oh! why has priesthood privilege to lie?”4 There is not one inhabitant of this town, not you yourself, Publius, who believes your assertion. You have not the least ground for suspicion, not even a loop to hang a doubt upon, that you speak the truth. If you could suborn wretches to swear it, they would not be credited by sensible and impartial judges.—You make the allegation, Publius, and reason and common sense declare, that the proof lies on you, for every man is presumed innocent until his guilt appears, and no man is obliged to prove a negative, that he did not act, or speak, as asserted. The following state of facts, in the knowledge and remembrance of many hundred inhabitants of this town, will convict you, Publius, of publishing a wanton and malicious untruth. In the beginning of the month of September last, Mr. Chase offered himself as a candidate for this town, and an opposition immediately commenced by a party, but soon died away. About 21st of September the new form of government for America arrived here, and the party in opposition to Mr. Chase were for adopting it without any attempt to obtain any alteration or amendment. Some of them were so foolish as to propose before it was published, to demand of Mr. Chase, whether he was for or against it.—From the impenetrable silence observed by Mr. Chase with regard to the proposed constitution, his adversaries concluded that he was opposed to the adoption of it by this State. There is not one person who can truly say, that he ever knew Mr. Chase’s sentiments before the election, nor, as I have been well informed, did he ever disclose his opinion until he delivered it in the House of Delegates, after he had moved and carried the resolution for the legislature “to recommend to the people of this State to submit the proceedings of the federal convention to a convention of the people, for their full and free investigation and decision.”5 Some of the leaders among Mr. Chase’s enemies in this town had ignorantly taken up an opinion, that our legislature were to decide some questions that might defeat the adoption of the new government by this State; and under this impression they raised a clamour against Mr. Chase, and objected, that he ought not to be elected, because he was antifederal(a) (an appellation as improperly as artfully applied to every person opposed to the new government) and that therefore he would not vote for a convention.—Mr. Chase at a public meeting at the Court-House, on 26th September, and by hand-bills of 27th and 29th of the same month (which the inhabitants of Baltimore must remember) declared, “that he always had been, and then was, a friend to a permanent and stable federal government; that our legislature could have nothing to say to any question, respecting the proposed plan of [552]constitution for the United States—but only whether they would recommend a convention to consider and decide on the subject; that he had not made up his opinion, whether the plan of government proposed ought to be accepted, without any amendment or alteration; and he engaged to use his endeavours to procure, early in the next session, a recommendation by the General Assembly to call a convention, and to appoint the election, as soon as the convenience of the people would permit, and that, in his opinion, the election ought to be in the spring, in the month of March or April at farthest.”6 I call on you, Publius, to come forth like a man and not skulk behind the curtain, and point out (if you can) any other declaration, engagement, or promise, by Mr. Chase, in public, or private, in writing, or verbally, to any person. From these facts, which cannot be controverted, I assert, Publius, that you have sacrificed every sense of shame and decency, and all regard to truth and justice, on the altar of party and faction. If, Publius, you have entrusted your real name to your confederates, they must feel for your dishonorable and disgraceful conduct. When you enter into company, your guilty conscience, Publius, will tell you that each circulating whisper points you out as a mean and despicable wretch, without veracity or honor. Discover your real name, Publius, and the boys in the streets will hoot the liar as he passes. April 21, 1788. (a) The term antifederal is applied by the advocates of the new government for America, by way of reproach to all those who oppose it. Words are often misunderstood and as often misapplied. The government proposed is truly a national, and not a federal government. A national government is a supreme authority pervading and ruling over the people of a country: Its advocates therefore may, with propriety be called nationals; and its opponents anti-nationals.—A federal government is an union or league of independent States, for mutual protection and defence; and its advocates are truly federal. This town is called federal by Publius.—The following anecdote will shew how the term is misapplied, and that it is only used to deceive the common people. It being objected, to the new government, that in its effect and operation, it would annihilate the State governments and State legislatures, a busy, meddling, factious Priest, of this town, a quaint, smooth, true son of Calvin, that sins against his reason, replied, “That the sooner the State governments were abolished the better.” Proh pudor!7 and yet this man boasts of his federalism, and his party are the friends of the people. “For Churchmen, tho’ they itch to govern all, are silly, woeful, awkward politicians.”8"
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,4/22/1788,"(Continued from No. 368.) It remains to apply the foregoing principles to the American States—It is now evident, that they are not to be fixed as a constellation to give light to revolving ages—they have blazed for a moment like meteors in a troubled sky: Scarce has peace secured them the independance they sought, when a mighty revolution is to annihilate their separate and independant sovereignties, and to embrace them in the wide arms [526]of one general government; it is impossible that the free citizens of these States could listen for a moment, to such a tremendous and awful change, but from some real defects which they have experienced in their separate constitutions—That there are such cannot be denied—but still the author has no hopes that the citizens of these States will ever be again so happy as they were under the government of Great-Britain and since the revolution—The state of society before the late war was remarkably mild and moderate, and what is uncommon, we rather combatted the theory of tyranny than the practice—since the war we have been much embarrassed by a great encrease of private, and the creation of an enormous public debt, with its attendant paper securities, the corrupting influence of which would contaminate a society of angels; our new elevation among the nations of the earth has opened to our principal citizens unbounded prospects of national splendor and private preferment, which lay dormant in our former dependant situation—all these, and a variety of other causes have combined to disturb the public tranquility and vitiate our social happiness.—We have no opportunity of comparing our situation but with that which existed before the late revolution, and from this we conclude our forms of government are defective, without considering our change of situation, or without reflecting how few countries in the world are so happy as we are at this moment—notwithstanding we are in the most disturbed of all situations of society, that is on the eve of a great revolution; suppose such a change was now impending in any other country in the world—a change opening such unlimited views to some and so detrimental to other individuals, involving the interests and agitating the passions of every citizen—could so much moderation and candor be expected—the general abhorrence which we all entertain of the violences of the mad partizans of the new system, evinces the mild state of our present institutions. Notwithstanding this, no man is more thoroughly convinced than the Farmer, that there is not a government in the confederacy perfect, or indeed founded on solid fixed principles.—Pennsylvania has the boldest direction to a happy theory of all the new contrivances—but still it is fundamentally defective, and it is said that they are daily weakening in practice the great virtue of their institution, instead of substantiating so glorious an idea—The four New-England States were practically the most solid in their formation, until two of them2 were spoiled by their nasty new ginger-bread work—and yet they originally required amendments—their town meetings, which were the essential pith and marrow of their constitution seem rather to have been regulated by manners, than substantiated by proper and legal powers; as [527]for the others they were all begun in the middle and formed without materials necessary for the work—they remain and must remain governments on paper, substantiated by anarchy and misrule—New-York indeed, by an excess of inverted ingenuity, has contrived to make something like a real government, that would for a length of years secure their political freedom—On the other hand Georgia is utterly incomprehensible—it appears at first sight all body and no head or feet, and on nearer view it has no body either—it is in fact a lusus naturæ3 in the political world—However, should they all escape the stroke that now impends, which is hardly to be expected, it is in my opinion utterly impossible for nine out of thirteen to prolong their feeble existence for twenty years without considerable alterations.—I see nothing that could greatly injure New-York, Connecticut or Rhode-Island. Were I to give a model of a perfect government, it would not vary greatly from the Connecticut charter—the amendments would be all in the town-meetings—Rhode-Island lays under a popular odium—all governments have their inconveniences, but I should be apt to ascribe those of Connecticut and Rhode-Island to their paper securities and other evils of the late war.—When parties run high, popular odium is a very uncertain test of truth, and audi et alteram partem—hear both sides, is the best maxim of political and moral justice. However the conduct of Rhode-Island with regard to paper money, as we hear it, is incomprehensible—What shall I say of Pennsylvania? When I view this bold effort of the human understanding, I am struck with admiration and surprize at the masterly hand of him4 that broke through the mounds of prejudice and education, guided by the glimmering of a distant light; he adventured boldly into the realms of truth, but the brilliant resplendence dazzled his sight—he found himself alone and unsupported, and he retired precipitately to his companions, who were groping in error and darkness—Let Pennsylvania pursue with energy and propriety the ray of light, which beams through the mass of her constitution; let her establish county meetings of freeholders, to whom one third of her legislature may refer a contested law for the revision of the great body of the people by actual vote—establish county seminaries of learning and similar institutions to promote true patriotism and true knowledge, and she will last the envy of mankind until time shall be no more—As it is she is a child of nature, and strong convulsions must attend her destruction. As to all the other institutions of this continent, they are governments of the people, and yet the people are excluded from all share in the government. They can only be supported by the few individuals who are objects of elections, maintaining a disinterested preference of the [528]public good to their private convenience—for it must be ever held in view, that the interest of the few is opposed to the public interest, but the interest of the many, is the public interest—on which great distinction the weakness of representative government depends—The elected few are tempted to corruption by all the emoluments of government, and by that plunder which public disorder affords—they are screened from punishment by making legislation subservient to their interested purposes, and there is no control but public manners and the propinquity of our independant States, which enforces moderation by interest, emulation and example—Public manners are daily corrupting by a fell avarice, which is the canker worm of public and private virtue—the facility of gratifying avaricious views, by prostituting legislative authority, renders intrigue the only profitable quality in an age of venality. Profit, honor and distinction are all inseparably interwoven, and a man of deep intrigue must be necessarily, the most respected character in perverted governments—if virtue gets into office, rotation wheels it out, hated and despised.—This view which I believe to be in a great measure just, although the principles are but develloping, discover our systems to be fundamentally wrong, did not the proposed revolution bear a more fatal testimony; the truth is that we aimed at, and still aim at premature public splendor and private luxury, forgetting that bodies politic, like natural bodies have their duration of manly vigor and the decline of age, prolonged and regulated by the length of years in which they have been arriving at maturity.—We wanted to be every thing at once—that is what we now wish, and in the event we shall be nothing or worse than nothing; we strived to patch up the ruined fabric of the British constitution for our use, and rushing headlong to our object, we did not discover the precipices that lay in our road—we never reflected, that we had none of those distinctions of ranks which preserve that government—that the state of our society was altogether different—and that we had only the wishes, but none of the means. (To be continued.)"
Newspaper,No,A Farmer,,Maryland Gazette,,4/25/1788,"(Continued from our last.) Will then the proposed national government provide a proper remedy for these defects?—I do not hesitate to declare, that in my judgment, without considerable amendments, the remedy will prove infinitely worse than the disease.—In the first place, it is undeniably the worse constitution in North-America, excepting that of Georgia—It has every defect which all the others labour under, and considerably increased; for all the vices of representation become more dangerous in proportion to the extent of territory and variety of interests represented. The qualified negative of the President is more than overbalanced by his junction with the aristocratic branch—indeed the difficulties attending, the making of any government at all, upon republican principles for so extensive a continent, rendered it but a patched up affair even on paper. To have agreed upon any one plan, was beyond all human calculation—and their attention to the perfecting of the system was prevented by a constant endeavour to keep it together—can we then be surprized that it is so defective? The recollection of these difficulties deter the advocates of the system from any future convention, not reflecting that a future convention could not destroy what is done, that [536]if with the full sense of their constituents, they could agree on no amendments, it would still remain for the States to adopt as it now stands—but this may be a subject of future consideration.—It is certain we had better have no general government than a bad one—We may make one hereafter, but we shall never get rid of this if we adopt it—Its defects are that it almost entirely neglects civil liberty, that is the rights of individuals against legislative and executive encroachments—It is true it has a bill of rights, but then it is the shortest that ever was seen; although long enough for the government as originally reported—yet now it appears that they stumbled over diamonds in order to pick up stones; and it is most certain that this new system will entirely annihilate that federal freedom which would have attoned in a great measure, for the loss of the forms of both political and civil liberty.—Had the States continued separate, sovereign and independant, they must have bid an eternal defiance to despotism, and they might have had leisure to have amended gradually the defects of their several institutions; as it is, the same authority operating immediately on the individuals of such vast territories, differing materially in national interests and private manners must from necessity, be either despotic or ineffectual, and that for the following among many other reasons.—The misrule and commotions of this general government (and all governments are unavoidably subject to misrule and its attendant commotions) will agitate the passions and affect the interests of the whole mass of national society by the same shock; of course the fate of the empire must be involved in the good or bad administration of the most complicated and difficult system of government, that mankind ever yet beheld; but had the States remained separate and sovereign, this misrule if their individuals or even the revolution of a single State, being altogether local, would have left the others, entirely unagitated, to interpose the voice of reason and pursue the dictates of justice, which is the great and applauded security and happiness of a confederacy of republics. The examples adduced and the opinions given by Montesquieu, extend only to unions between States, not governments of individuals—In Montesquieu’s time, fœderal had entirely a different meaning from what it has now2—The small distinction between a confederacy operating on States collectively in their corporate capacity, and a general or national government exercising legislative, executive and judiciary powers on every citizen of the empire, so trifling to Aristides, that he marches over it without noticing, would probably have brought this great legislator for mankind, to a full stop.—Called upon so solemnly as he is, if the good old Frenchman could come back and see how his works are read and understood in our day, and what principles they [537]are quoted to support, he would certainly take up his books and carry them off with him.—In the new American government there is nothing to prevent despotism, every feature and symptom forebode its rapid approach. In the first place it will not be denied but that a nation must be governed by its own sense of what is right, and then they are free—or they must be governed contrary to their sense, and then it must be by despotic force and they become slaves.—Where the national interests of separate parts [of] an empire differ materially—each part must mutually give up part of its interests and wishes, to constitute an impartial general law—which made by a mutual sacrifice opinion must in its nature be contrary to the sense of the whole—As the people then loose sight of the only means of judging of what is right, that is their own feelings—power becomes transferred on their rulers, without any certain limitation remaining with their constituents, who always displeased even with the most perfect impartiality, which in this case becomes general injustice, must have their senses and their strength destroyed, or they will destroy the government.—Again a nation to be governed according to its own sense of what is right, must have some regular and certain mode of changing the effective administration of their government, or they will be involved in such constant turbulence and commotion, that the quiet slavery of despotism, will appear preferable and be submitted to—a complicated system, which hides from investigation the diseased part, and destroys responsibility (one State changing its representatives for a law which will be popular in other States, who will encourage and support theirs) will soon reduce our people to despair—complicated forms are therefore always simplified by the sword of a despot.—Again our immense territory offers a secure asylum, easily surrounded by solitary wildernesses, in which despotism may safely erect her throne of terrors; we shall not be surrounded by a number of independant States, who may control our government by the influence of a balance of power:—And lastly, what is most dangerous, our state of society demands either absolute freedom or absolute tyranny—we have among us none of those permanent orders and distinct ranks of men, which are the only security of the mixed governments we so much admire—All are entitled to be equally free, and they will be so, or by one common ruin involved themselves in an equal slavery. In such cases the gradation is an easy, constant, and natural one—Voltaire, with more truth than many are aware of, calls Turkey a great democracy—and any State as large as Turkey, without [those?] distinctions of different orders of society, will be ruled by exactly such a government as Turkey—the difference between a pure democracy and a pure despotism is not worth a distinction—Representation will [538]not do—I have not the smallest doubt but that every reflecting merchant in the southern States, and every member that has served them in Congress, would this moment rather entrust the regulation of our commerce to a President and Council, independant of all the States, than to a Senate in which the staple States are out-voted as eight to five—Thus we can even now discover that the authority of one man is a law fundamental in all large governments—and that is despotism—To conclude this general government as it now stands, without the necessary checks, will either be unable to move at all, from the stout resistance and alarmed jealousy of the separate States, which may not perhaps be an undesirable event—or secondly, which would be the most dishonorable event, it may frighten us to take shelter again under the wing of Great-Britain—or lastly and worst of all, it may in one day by a vigorous and good administration, lay the foundation of as dreadful a tyranny as ever scourged mankind—How shall we avoid the three—the first and most obvious instruction of wisdom, would be to tread back the hasty and injudicious steps we have taken—recur to first principles, when we are sensible that we labor under any defect, the common lesson of reason is to look for the disease at home and apply a remedy there—Fools and children look abroad for assistance—Americans amend your separate constitutions!—When they are right, you will no longer hanker after these dangerous general governments—Were I assured this could be done now, my decided advice would be to divide the continental debt according to the average revenues of each State since peace—leave a committee of Congress to sell the western territory, and to call a general council when necessary—but break up Congress until the present esprit du corps should be thoroughly annihilated—But as I despair of proper State amendments, I would advise our conventions to digest those amendments to the proposed system, which will guard the civil rights of our citizens—agree on those checks on the general government which will prevent their legislating for individuals, but in cases where the State governments are actually deficient and refractory—this may secure our political and fœderal liberty—having done this, let them authorise their former deputies or others to meet those of the other States, revise their work and then adjourn to give them time for six or eight months; if no amendments can be got, they may if they choose adopt it as it now stands on their second meeting—at present the important States who have adopted, are most anxious for such amendments—will they not rather agree to this proposal, than risque amending after a government should be adopted, which from its great powers and the numerous offices it will have the disposal of, may certainly influence one-fourth of the States [539]to reject any diminution of their authority?—But at all events my countrymen, no standing army—If this government is founded on truth, truth can always defend her own cause against error or design—and now that you may be free and happy is the interest, and I will add, the wish of A FARMER."

Monday in March—proposed an earlier day of meeting.9 Representation. 1. A fact—the continent will be governed by 65. Six northern states—35—seven southern states. 30.10 2. I do not object that the states have not an equal representation in the second branch or House of Representatives. 3. I object because the representatives will not be the representatives of the people at large but really of a few rich men in each state. A representative should be the image of those he represents. He should know their sentiments and their wants and desires—he should possess their feelings—he should be governed by their interests with which his own should be inseparably connected. The representatives of so extensive a country—consequently such numbers should be numerous.—A few men cannot possibly represent the opinions, wishes and interests of great numbers. It is impossible for a few men to be acquainted with the sentiments and interests of the United States which contains many different classes or orders of people—Merchants, farmers, planters, mechanics and gentry or wealthy men. To form a proper and true representation each order ought to have an opportunity of choosing from each a person as their representative; this is impossible from the smallness of the number—65. Can six men be found in Maryland11 who understand the interests of the several orders of men in this state and are acquainted with their situation, wants and would act with a proper sense and zeal to promote their prosperity—If such could be found will they be chosen by the people? No—but few of the merchants and those only of the opulent and ambitious will stand any chance. The great body of farmers and planters cannot expect any of their order—the station is too elevated for them to aspire to—the distance between the people and their representatives will be so very great that there is no probability of a farmer or planter being chosen.—Mechanics of every branch will be excluded by a general voice from a seat—only the gentry, the rich and well born will be elected. Wealth creates power—the wealthy always have a number of dependants—they always favor each other—it is their interest to combine and they will consequently always unite their efforts to procure those of their own order or rank to be elected and they will generally succeed. The station is too high and elevated to be filled but by the first men in the state in point of fortune and influence. In fact no [634]order or class of the people will be represented in the House of Representatives—called the Democratic branch—but the rich and wealthy. They will be ignorant of the sentiments of the middling (and much more of the lower) class of citizens, strangers to their ability, unacquainted with their wants, difficulties and distress and need of sympathy and fellow feeling. 4. ⟨The members are too few. It is to consist at first of 65—and cannot exceed 1 for 30,000 inhabitants—whites and ⅗ slaves—a majority, a quorum 33—ergo 17 may make a law—liable to bribery and corruption.⟩12 G. B. and F. (i.e. Great Britain and France) will endeavor to obtain an influence to procure treaties of commerce, and alliances offensive and defensive—they will practice the means—Holland is a proof. This objection applies to the Senate—at first 26. 14 a majority [which makes a quorum] 8 may make a law—liable to same bribery and corruption. Madness to vest 25 men with absolute power—no free people ever reposed power in so small a number. The Executive will corrupt them—they are not excluded from office. The last House of Commons above 500 members. Number of inhabitants about 8 millions—1 for little above 14,000—The members in the Democratic branches in 13 states amount to 2,000. The numbers should be too great to be corrupted and not so great as to be a mob. 5. ⟨The House of Representatives will not be chosen by the people. Art. 1. Sect. 2. Maryland is to choose 6 representatives—every person qualified to elect members of our House of Delegates is to be entitled to vote. Our legislature is to prescribe the time, place and manner of electing representatives. Art. 1. Sect. 4. Aristides 9.13 Either the people at large of the whole state must choose the six representatives, or the state must be divided into six Districts for each to elect one man.—Say 2 on Eastern and 4 on Western shore.⟩14 If the whole people choose they will meet in their counties on the same day; this is proposed by some—consider such an election. If in districts the inconvenience—and the last who vote will elect—and choice like as if all chose. Suppose our delegates chosen in this manner. On the whole I am convinced, 1st. That the representatives will be merely nominal from the persons and the members elected; 2nd. That the right of electing is nugatory and cannot be effectually exercised—it is only a fallacious participation by the people at large in the National legislature. 6. There is no security even for this nugatory right. 7. I have said the Senate are too few in number. 8. ⟨The Senate are a perpetual body and never die a civil death (as in this State) although ⅓ is to be chosen every second year, because after the first six years there will always be ⅔ of the body in existence—⅓ of which ⅔ will always have served 2 years: and the other ⅓ will have served 4 years and after the first rotation every Senator may serve six years⟩15—The body is permanent—will act by system—⅓ at end of every second year may be different men if legislature pleases. 9. In classing, the Senator who pleases will not be put in the class to go out before six years. Vide Boston Debates. 73.16 (The following sentence at the head of one of the papers is struck out;—I have long since determined that I would not accept a seat in the Convention unless gentlemen whose political principles I approved would offer their services to the people.) I am a friend to our present State government because it is wisely calculated to secure all the civil and religious rights of the people and fully adequate for all internal State purposes, and our State Constitution and laws afford security to property and ample protection to the poor from abuse by the officers of our State government and from any oppression of the poor by the rich and powerful. There is no injury for which our present laws do not provide a remedy.—There are some few, and not very capital, defects in our form of government and they may at any time be amended with prudence and sense without any division or commotion—in a word; We might be happy under our present State government, if we knew our own good, and would be contented. I am opposed—averse from the proposed national government, because it immediately takes away the power from our State legislature to protect the personal liberty of the citizen, and I am convinced in my judgment that it will in a few years entirely absorb and swallow up the State legislature. Our Bill of Rights which is part of our constitution provides17—Sect. 2. that the people of this state ought to have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof. Sect. 3. That the inhabitants are entitled to the Trial by Jury according to the course of common law, not only in criminal cases but in all cases between Government and its officers—Cause etc. Sect. 17. Every freeman for any injury to person or property ought to have remedy by the law of the land. Sect. 18. Trial of facts where they arise is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estate of the people. Sect. 23. All warrants without oath to search, etc. Sect. 13. Laying taxes by the poll is grevious and oppressive and ought to be abolished. Sect. 25. Militia proper and natural defence of a people. free government. Sect. 26. Standing armies.—27.—28. No Soldier to be quartered in any house in time of peace without the consent of the owner, and in time of war in such manner only as the legislature shall direct. Sect. 38. The liberty of the press ought to be inviolably preserved. Sect. 33. Securing religious rights of conscience. By our present form of government, the legislature is not supreme but bound by the constitution. The National Government will in its operation and effects annihilate the State Governments. 1. National Government has unlimited power, legislative, executive and judicial, as to every object to which it extends by the Constitution. 2. The powers of the National legislature extend to every case of the least consequence—it may make laws to affect the lives, liberty and property of every citizen in America, nor can the Constitution of any State prevent the Execution of any power given to the National legislature. 3. The National legislature may impose every species of taxes external and internal (except only on exports) excises land tax, poll tax, Stamps etc. to any extent, and may raise and collect them as they please, without any previous requisition to the State legislatures who have nothing to say to the laws for imposing or collecting taxes— 4. The power to impose and collect taxes is the most important of all powers a people can grant—it absorbs all other powers. Maxim—Money finds Men (Troops) and Troops will find money—The power of taxation is the highest object of legislation—it is the necessary means of protection and safety to the people in a good government and it ever has been and will be the instrument of oppression and tyranny in a bad government. 5. No state can emit paper money—nor without consent of Congress lay any duties on Imports or Exports or Tonnage except for executing its inspection laws, and in such cases the net produce is for the use of the United States—Therefore no state can pay its debts—or support its government but only by direct taxes on property—Congress can lay all indirect taxes, and also direct taxes when they exercise this power in all its extent. The state legislatures will find it impossible to raise money by direct taxes to pay their debts and support their governments—the consequence is certain—without money they will be as Congress is now; without power, or respect and despised—they will sink to nothing, and be absorbed in the general government. The people will not bear the expense of two governments. The state governments may come in for some time to carry into execution the National Government—even this [637]may be taken away. Art. 1. Sect. 4. See Aristides 37. Impost 38. Farmer’s Letters 9. p. 37.18 Will impost pay interest of national foreign and domestic debt and expenses of new government? 6. The power of the national legislature to raise troops in peace (as well as war) without any limitation as to number, or with consent of more than a majority in Congress (I say not less than 9 of 13 and in same proportion) or a majority of the State legislatures and to levy money for their support for two years—to control the militia will also (?tend) to swallow up the State governments— 7. The supreme and inferior federal courts will have the same effect by absorbing the state courts—One must be in each state. 8. The power to make laws (Art. 1. Sect. 8).—e.g. the state lays a direct tax to pay its debts or to support its government. Congress thinks proper to lay tax on same property and as both cannot be paid cannot Congress repeal the State law, or will not their judges declare it void. Will not this conduct deprive the State of all support? 9. (8. repeated in orig.) The little power reserved to the states will be an object of jealousy to Congress. The whole Constitution breathes a jealousy of the states—its judges and juries. Truth confirmed by experience of ages that every individual, and all bodies of men invested with power, always attempt to increase it, and never part with any of it but by force. It is the very nature of Man. The National Government will possess this desire and having the means it will in time carry it into execution. I think the people themselves will assent and may be persuaded to call for the abolition of the state governments. It is at this moment the wish of many men in America and some in this state. Liberty of Conscience—Old Whig No. 5-4. Brutus No. 219 Bill or Declaration of Rights. Liberty of Press. 1. The Constitution gives no power to Congress express or implied to abridge or take away the liberty of the press. 2. Art. 1. Sect. 8. Congress have power to promote Science and it is impossible to promote Science and at same time destroy the liberty of the press—under this clause may write what they please about government. There is no Bill or Declaration of rights to restrain Congress—They will have the power and it remains in their discretion when they will exercise it. Expenses of National Government. Civil List—President—Vice-President—Senators—Representatives—Ambassadors—Judicial Department—Judges, Justices, Chancellors, Clerks, Sheriffs, Excise officers, Naval officers—Locusts—Policy to institute a number of lucrative new offices to increase their influence in the States—Army will provide for many expectants. I am opposed to the new government;— 1. Because it gives Congress a power without any limitation to lay any kind of taxes that the invention of Man can suggest—indirect and direct. I particularly object to the power to lay taxes on our lands without any limitation and according to our numbers including ⅗ of our slaves. Also to an Excise and the power to excise officers to enter and search and no remedy by such in State Courts—and Verdict by a Jury; as under the British government. Clayton’s Rep. 44. Woman’s shift.20 Also to a poll tax which Congress is expressly authorized—Art. 1. Sect. 9.—to lay on all our whites and ⅗ of our slaves—the most fatal and oppressive of all taxes. N. B. a favorite tax with Congress and R.M. (i.e. Robt. Morris)21 2. Because Congress will have a right to keep an army in time of peace without number. 3. Because Congress will have a right to quarter soldiers in our private houses, not only in time of war, but also in time of peace. Bill of Rights 28.22 4. Because Congress will have authority over our Militia, and may if they please, march any of them without regard to scruples of conscience against bearing arms, to any part of the United States. 5. Because the inferior federal courts will have the exclusive jurisdiction—Art. 3. Sect. 2. of every controversy between the citizens of the different states—and no trial by Jury. Blackstone 3. c. 33.23 6. Because these courts will have the same jurisdiction in controversies between our citizens and subjects of Great Britain or any other foreign state—Tobacco shipped. N.B. An appeal in both cases. 7. Because the Senators or Representatives may be appointed to civil offices under the United States not created or the emoluments increased during the time for which he was elected. 8. Because Congress are to ascertain their own salaries. Art. 1. Sect.= 6. 9. Because the Senate are too few in number—only two from each State. 26 at present—a Majority, a quorum—14—ergo 8 may make a law—liable to corruption—?by France, Great Britain. 10. ⟨Because the Senate are a perpetual body and never die a civil death, although ⅓ is to be chosen every second year—because after first six years there will always be ⅔ of the body in existence—⅓ of which ⅔ will always have served two years and other four years and after first rotation every Senator may serve 6 years.⟩24 11. Because ⅔ of the Senate present and the president may make treaties of commerce, and the treaties are to be the supreme laws of the land. 12. ⟨Because the Representatives are too few in number—1 for 30,000—whites and ⅗ slaves—65 at present—a majority, a quorum 33.—ergo 17 may make a law—liable to corruption.⟩25 13. ⟨The House of Representatives will not be chosen by the people. Art. 1. Sect. 2. Maryland is to choose 6 representatives—Every person qualified to elect members to our House of Delegates to be entitled to vote—our legislature is to prescribe the time, place and manner of electing representatives. Art. 1. Sect. 4.—Either the people at large of the whole state must choose the six representatives—or the state must be divided into six districts—say 2 on Eastern and 4 on Western shore.⟩26 14. Because Congress may alter the time, place and manner of choosing representatives. Art. 1. Sect. 4. proceedings Boston 47.51.(?60)27 15. Because Congress may alter the time and manner of choosing Senators—the place where is not to be altered.28 N.B. Treaties supreme law. Sect. 6.29 See Aristides p. 11.30 Massachusetts propose to restrict this power to cases expressed.31 16. Because the president will not be chosen by the people immediately—that is by electors chosen by the people—as pretended. Art. 2. Sect. 2. The legislature are to direct who are to be electors, but the number is fixed to be equal to the whole number of Senators & Representatives—e.g. in this state 8—in all 91. Congress are to determine the time of choosing electors and the day on which they shall elect the president which shall be the same day in all the states. The electors are to choose by ballot two persons. The person having a majority of all the electors to be president and if no person has a majority—which is most improbable, except in first instance32 then from the five highest on the list the House of Representatives to choose the president—each State to have a vote. 17. Because the powers of the President are dangerous. Power of nominating to office. Of pardoning before conviction. 18. Because he is eligible for life and he ought to be ineligible after a given number of years. 19. Because the Judicial power extends to controversies between citizens of different states and between citizens of the states and subjects of foreign states and in such cases the trial by Jury is taken away. 20. It is said by the advocates for the new government that we are without a government. Ans. They mean a general or national government—not a state government. The former is wanted to make the states do their duty, and pay this quota to discharge the debt contracted during the war—and to protect the states against the Powers of Europe [640](There is a power to decide differences between the States in the Federal Congress) and to regulate trade. If admitted—yet no necessity much less wisdom to do more than is necessary to answer these objects—powers for these purposes can be given without surrendering up our liberties. 21. The new government will take the burthen from the farmer and planter, and the poor people and place it on trade—because duties on imports and tax on exise will be adopted. Ans. Why cannot state governments do the same?—In truth it is only changing in part the mode of taxation—explain it. Why poll tax is not for the benefit of the poor. 22. Regulations of trade and treaties of commerce will bring in money—employ our merchants—shipbuilders. Ans. if true, give those powers but not those granted. 23. The people can’t be worse. Ans. Why are they distressed?—many from their private debts—some from taxes—all from the scarcity of money. Will new government pay private debts? Will it lessen taxes? It will make our Continental debt specie—it is now at 8 for 1. £200,000 would pay the proportion of this state—it was proposed by an emission—Consider the expenses of National government. 24. The government is calculated for a few rich and ambitious men—and speculators in Certificates— 25. Merchants are for it. Ans. Consider them. Birds of passage. 26. General Washington et al. for it. 27. May amend afterwards. Ans. The amendments proposed prove that these are capital defects. Should amend before adoption—1. because it is easy to grant power and very difficult to recall power which from its nature is ever encroaching. 2. No wise people ever gave power over their liberties with a view of getting back the power. 3. it is now in the power of five states to obtain amendments 33—afterwards there must be nine.—4. a bad government becomes more feared every day by its officers. 5. why not another convention? Who is violent for it—Ans. Rich men and speculators and office hunters. Call on friends to give reasons for new government. (On the margin of this paper the following;)—Why call on people at large? Haste—no delay—Senate for Jany.— The greatest happiness of a people is to govern themselves. Their greatest misery to be governed by others;— Our state government is fully competent to all internal state purposes. For the safety and happiness of the people of this and the other states, external objects, or such for which the state governments are not competent are to be provided for. 1. To provide a form to regulate commerce among the states and to preserve peace between the states—resort against domestic enemies, with Indian tribes, and to coin money and to regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin and to fix the standard of weights and measures—to establish post offices and post roads—may be called a general internal or continental object. 2. To preserve all the states from injury or violence from the foreign powers of Europe and to shield them against foreign hostility may be called a general external or foreign object. 3. To regulate the trade of the states with foreigners, by Acts of Navigation and by treaties of commerce with the powers of Europe may be also called a general external or foreign object. I am for the establishment of power in Congress for all the above or similar purposes. The 1st.—to preserve peace between the states etc. may be provided for without much difficulty (and about which there never has been nor can be much difference in opinion) by establishing a supreme power to decide all controversies to coin money, etc. etc. between the states, to coin money, etc. etc. and by a Bill of Rights declaring what the states shall not do—as, e.g. not to enter into any treaty, keep troops, coin money, or do any of the above or other acts which the supreme power of all the states are authorised to do. The 2nd.—to preserve all the states etc.—This necessarily includes the power of war;—and the means to carry it on—i.e. to raise money, to maintain troops and to provide a navy: and it includes the jurisdiction of piracies and felonies on the high seas and of all offences against the law of nations. This also includes the payment of the debt contracted by the United States. This power is necessary, not immediately pressing—Consider the situation of Confederation—but attended with some difficulty. It requires a legislative, an executive and a judicial authority. Every legislative power should be vested in two, if not three Branches,34 and they ought to be the real, and not the fictitious representatives of the people. Their numbers ought to be sufficient to know the wants and the wishes of those they represent—too numerous to be corrupted and not so great as to be a mob. The Executive of the states ought to be in a supreme magistrate or president—ineligible after a limited time with a Council of short duration and responsible for their advice. The Judicial should be confined to the decision of cases arising on treaties. (The clause “on treaties” is substituted for—“under the constitution and laws”—erased.) The great question is in what manner the legislative of the states shall raise taxes on the people of the several states. I would not give this power—only on default of a state to raise its quota as required. If neglected, I would authorise the legislative to lay and collect imposts and duties on tonnage without limitation, provided they be uniform in all the states; also taxes not exceeding limited sums on enumerated articles of exports, and stamp—and post office duties. If they (be) not sufficient, an excise. Provided they be the same in all the states and that Congress officers be held to account for abuse of authority in the states—and if all (be) not sufficient, a tax on land not exceeding 1/2 d. per acre. I would (?Query? not) give the above power of taxation without requisition being first made to the states. It is difficult to say what taxes the legislative may lay, but some limitation is necessary. The Third—to regulate trade— I am against giving this power—but if it is given let it be to ⅔ of the Senate.35 (Earlier in the original ms. we find erased—“The 3d.—to regulate trade etc.—This I would agree to”—the sentence being left unfinished.)."
Newspaper,No,William Paca,,Maryland Journal,,4/26/1788,"Late last Night the following Particulars were delivered to the Editor, for Publication in this Day’s Paper.

Newspaper,No,"William Paca, Samuel Chase, John Francis Mercer, Jeremiah Chase, John Love, Charles Ridgley, Edward Cockey, Nathan Cromwell, Charles Ridgley (Wm.), Luther Martin, Benjamin Harrison, William Pinkney",,Maryland Journal,,5/1/1788,"To the PEOPLE of MARYLAND. The following facts, disclosing the conduct of the late convention of Maryland, is submitted to the serious consideration of the citizens of the state. On Monday, the 21st of April, the convention met in Annapolis, and elected the honourable George Plater, Esq; president. On Tuesday they established rules for the conduct of the business; and on the same day the following question was propounded to the convention:— “When a motion is made and seconded, the matter of the motion shall receive a determination by the question, or be postponed by general consent, or the previous question, before any other motion shall be received.” And the following question, viz. “Every question shall be entered on the journal, and the yeas and nays may be called for by any member on any question, and the name of the member requiring them shall be entered on the journal.” Which two questions the convention determined in the negative. On Wednesday [23 April], the proposed plan of government was read the first time, and thereupon it was resolved, “That this convention will not enter into any resolution upon any particular part of the proposed plan of federal government for the United States, but that the whole thereof shall be read through a second time, after which the subject may be fully debated and considered, and then the president shall put the question, That this convention do assent to and ratify the same constitution? On which question the yeas and nays shall be taken.” On Thursday [24 April], the members who were opposed to the ratification of the constitution, without such previous amendments could be obtained as they thought essentially necessary to secure the liberty and happiness of the people (being confined by the last resolution to consider in one view the whole of the plan of government) stated some of their objections to the constitution.—The convention met in the evening, when Mr. Paca, member from Harford, having just taken his seat, rose and informed the president, that he had great objections to the constitution proposed, in its present form, and meant to propose a variety of amendments, not to prevent, but to accompany, the ratification; but, having just arrived, he was not ready to lay them before the house, and requested indulgence until the morning for that purpose.—The proposal being seconded, and the house asked if they would give the indulgence, it was granted without a division, and they adjourned for that purpose.—On Friday [25 April], at the meeting of the house, Mr. Paca rose and informed the president, that, in consequence of the permission of the house given him the preceding evening, he had prepared certain amendments, which he would read in his place and then lay on the table, when was interrupted, and one member from each of the following counties, viz Frederick, Talbot, [662]Charles, Kent, Somerset, Prince-George’s, Worcester, Queen-Anne’s, Dorchester, Calvert and Caroline, and one member from the(a) city of Annapolis, and one from Baltimore-town, arose in their places, and declared for themselves and their colleagues, “that they were elected and instructed by the people they represented, to ratify the proposed constitution, and that as speedily as possible, and to do no other act; that after the ratification their power ceased, and they did not consider themselves as authorised by their constituents to consider any amendments.”—After this Mr. Paca was not permitted even to read his amendments.—The opponents continued to make their objections to the constitution until Saturday noon. The advocates of the government, although repeatedly called on, and earnestly requested, to answer the objections, if not just, remained inflexibly silent, and called for the question, that “the convention assent to and ratify the proposed plan of federal government for the United States?” Which was carried in the affirmative by 63 to 11. The vote of ratification having thus passed, Mr. Paca again arose and laid before the convention his propositions for amending the constitution thus adopted,1 which he had prepared by leave of the house, declaring that he had only given his assent to the government under the firm persuasion, and in full confidence, that such amendments would be peaceably obtained, as to enable the people to live happy under the government;—that the people of the county he represented, and that he himself, would support the government with such amendments, but without them, not a man in the state, and no people, would be more firmly opposed to it than himself and those he represented. Sentiments highly favourable to amendments were expressed, and a general murmur of approbation seemed to arise from all parts of the house, expressive of a desire to consider amendments, either in their characters as members of convention, or in their individual capacities as citizens; and the question was put on the following motion: “Resolved, That a committee be appointed to take into consideration and report to this house on Monday morning next, a draught of such amendments and alterations as may be thought necessary, in the proposed constitution for the United States, to be recommended to the consideration of the people of this state, if approved of by this convention; and Mr. Paca, Mr. Johnson, Mr. S. Chase, Mr. Potts, Mr. Mercer, Mr. Goldsborough, Mr. J. Tilghman, Mr. Hanson, Mr. J. T. Chase, Mr. Lee, Mr. W. Tilghman, Mr. McHenry and Mr. G. Gale, were appointed a committee for that purpose.” A division was called for on this resolution, when there appeared 66 members for, and not more than 7 against, it, And then it was resolved, “That the amendments proposed to the constitution by the delegate from Harford county should be referred to the above committee.” The committee thus appointed, and the convention adjourned to give them time to prepare their propositions; they proceeded with every appearance of unanimity to execute the trust reposed in them. The following amendments to the proposed constitution were separately agreed to by the committee, most of them by an unanimous vote, and all of them by a great majority: 1. That congress shall exercise no power but what is expressly delegated by this constitution. By this amendment, the general powers given to congress by the first and last paragraphs of the 8th sect. of art. 1, and the second paragraph of the 6th article, would be in a great measure restrained: those dangerous expressions by which the bills of rights and constitutions of the several states may be repealed by the laws of congress, in some degree moderated, and the exercise of constructive powers wholly prevented. 2. That there shall be a trial by jury in all criminal cases, according to the course of proceeding in the state where the offence is committed; and that there be no appeal from matter of fact, or second trial after acquittal; but this provision shall not extend to such cases as may arise in the government of the land or naval forces. 3. That in all actions on debts or contracts, and in all other controversies respecting property, or which the inferior federal courts have jurisdiction, the trial of facts shall be by jury, if required by either party; and that it be expressly declared, that the state courts, in such cases, have a concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts, with an appeal from either, only as to matter of law, to the supreme federal court, if the matter in dispute be of the value of _____ dollars. 4. That the inferior federal courts shall not have jurisdiction of less than _____ dollars; and there may be an appeal in all cases of revenue, as well to matter of fact as law, and congress may give the state courts jurisdiction of revenue cases, for such sums, and in such manner, as they may think proper. 5. That in all cases of trespasses done within the body of a county, and within the inferior federal jurisdiction, the party injured shall be entitled to trial by jury in the state where the injury shall be committed; and that it be expressly declared, that the state courts, in such cases, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts; and there shall be no appeal from either, except on matter of law; and that no person be exempt from such jurisdiction and trial but ambassadors and ministers privileged by the law of nations. 6. That the federal courts shall not be entitled to jurisdiction by fictions or collusion. 7. That the federal judges do not hold any other office of profit, or receive the profits of any other office under congress, during the time they hold their commission. The great objects of these amendments were, 1st. To secure the trial by jury in all cases, the boasted birth-right of Englishmen, and their decendants, and the palladium of civil liberty; and to prevent the appeal from fact, which not only destroys that trial in civil cases, but by construction, may also elude it in criminal cases; a mode of proceeding both expensive and burthensome, and also by blending law with fact, will destroy all check on the judiciary authority, render it almost impossible to convict judges of corruption, and may lay the foundation of that gradual and silent attack on individuals, by which the approaches of tyranny become irresistable. 2d. To give a concurrent jurisdiction to the state courts, in order that congress may not be compelled, as they will be under the present form, to establish inferior federal courts, which if not numerous will be inconvenient, and if numerous very expensive; the circumstances of the people being unequal to the increased expence of double courts, and double officers; an arrangement that will render the law so complicated and confused, that few men can know how to conduct themselves with safety to their persons or property, the great and only security of freemen. 3dly, To give such jurisdiction to the state courts, that transient foreigners, and persons from other states, committing injuries in this state, may be amenable to the state, whose laws they violate, and whose citizens they injure. 4thly, To prevent an extension of the federal jurisdiction, which may, and in all probability will, swallow up the state jurisdictions, and consequently sap those rules of descent and regulations of personal property, by which men now hold their estates; and lastly, To secure the independence of the federal judges, to whom the happiness of the people of this great continent will be so greatly committed by the extensive powers assigned them. 8. That all war[r]ants without oath, or affirmation of a person conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or his property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend any person suspected, without naming or describing the place or person in special, are dangerous, and ought not to be granted. This amendment was considered indispensable by many of the committee, for congress having the power of laying excises, the horror of a free people, by which our dwelling-houses, those castles considered [665]so sacred by the English law, will be laid open to the insolence and oppression of office, there could be no constitutional check provided, that would prove so effectual a safeguard to our citizens. General warrants too, the great engine by which power may destroy those individuals who resist usurpation, are also hereby forbid to those magistrates who are to administer the general government. 9. That no soldier be enlisted for a longer time than four years except in time of war, and then only during the war. 10. That soldiers be not quartered in time of peace upon private houses, without the consent of the owners. 11. That no mutiny bill continue in force longer than two years. These were the only checks that could be obtained against the unlimitted power of raising and regulating standing armies, the natural enemies to freedom, and even with these restrictions, the new congress will not be under such constitutional restraints as the parliament of Great-Britain; restraints which our ancestors have bled to establish, and which have hitherto preserved the liberty of their posterity. 12. That the freedom of the press be inviolably preserved. In prosecutions in the federal courts for libels, the constitutional preservation of this great and fundamental right, may prove invaluable. 13. That the militia shall not be subject to martial law, except in time of war, invasion or rebellion. This provision to restrain the powers of congress over the militia, although, by no means so ample as that provided by magna charta, and the other fundamental and constitutional laws of Great Britain, (it being contrary to magna charta to punish a freeman by martial law in time of peace, and murder to execute him,) yet it may prove an inestimable check; for all other provisions in favour of the rights of men, would be vain and nugatory, if the power of subjecting all men able to bear arms to martial law at any moment, should remain vested in congress. Thus far the amendments were agreed to. The following amendments were laid before the committee, and negatived by a majority. That the militia, unless selected by lot or voluntarily enlisted, shall not be marched beyond the limits of an adjoining state, without the consent of their legislature or executive That congress shall have no power to alter or change the time, place or manner, of holding elections for senators or representatives, unless a state shall neglect to make regulations, or to execute its regulations, or shall be prevented by invasion or rebellion; in which cases only congress may interfere, until the cause be removed. That, in every law of congress imposing direct taxes, the collection thereof shall be suspended for a certain reasonable time therein limited, and on payment of the sum by any state, by the time appointed, such taxes shall not be collected. That no standing army shall be kept up in time of peace, unless with the consent of two thirds of the members present of each branch of congress. That the president shall not command the army in person, without the consent of congress. That no treaty shall be effectual to repeal or abrogate the constitutions or bills of rights of the states, or any part of them. That no regulation of commerce, or navigation act, shall be made, unless with the consent of two thirds of the members of each branch of congress. That no member of congress shall be eligible to any office of profit under congress during the time for which he shall be appointed. That congress shall have no power to lay a poll tax. That no person, conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms in any case, shall be compelled personally to serve as a soldier. That there be a responsible council to the president. That there be no national religion established by law, but that all persons be equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty. That all imposts and duties laid by congress shall be placed to the credit of the state in which the same be collected, and shall be deducted out of such state’s quota of the common or general expences of government. That every man hath a right to petition the legislature for the redress of grievances in a peaceable and orderly manner. That it be declared, that all persons intrusted with the legislative or executive powers of government are the trustees and servants of the public, and as such accountable for their conduct. Wherefore, whenever the ends of government are perverted, and public liberty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to reform the old, or establish a new government; the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind. The committee having proceeded thus far, all the members who voted for the ratification declared, that they would engage themselves under every tie of honour to support the amendments they had agreed to, both in their public and private characters, until they should become a part of the general government; but a great majority of them insisted [667]on this express condition, that none of the propositions rejected, or any others, should be laid before the convention for their consideration, except those the committee had so agreed to. The gentlemen of the minority, who had made the propositions which had been rejected, reduced to the necessity of accommodating their sentiments to the majority, through fear of obtaining no security whatever for the people—notwithstanding they considered all the amendments as highly important to the welfare and happiness of the citizens of the states, yet to conciliate, they agreed to confine themselves to the first three of those propositions, and solemnly declared and pledged themselves, that if these were added, and supported by the other gentlemen, they would not only cease to oppose the government, but give all their assistance to carry it into execution so amended. Finally, they only required liberty to take the sense of the convention on the three first propositions, agreeing that they would hold themselves bound by the decision of a majority of that body. The first of these objections concerning the militia they considered as essential, for to march beyond the limits of a neighbouring state, the general militia, who consist of so many poor people that can illy be spared from their families and domestic concerns, by power of congress, who could know nothing of their circumstances, without consent of their own legislature or executive, ought to be restrained. The second objection respecting the power of congress to alter elections, they thought indi[s]pensable. Montesquieu says, that the rights of election should be established unalterably by fundamental laws in a free government. The third objection concerning previous requisition, they conceived highly important; they thought if money required by direct taxation could be paid with certainty and in due time to congress, that every good consequence would be secured to the union, and the people of the state thereby relieved from the great inconvenience and expence of a double collection and a double set of tax-gatherers, and they might also get rid of those odious taxes by ex[c]ise and poll, without injury to the general government. They were, however, again proposed and rejected. Affirmative, Mr. Paca, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Mercer, Mr. J. T. Chase, Mr. S. Chase. Negative, Mr. Lee, Mr. Potts, Mr. Goldsborough, Mr. J. Tilghman, Mr. W. Tilghman, Mr. Hanson, Mr. G. Gale, Mr. McHenry. Previous to this, a motion was made on Monday the twenty-ninth, in the convention, while the committee were sitting, in the following words, to wit: “Resolved, that this convention will consider of no propositions [668]for amendment of the federal government, except such as shall be submitted to them by the committee of thirteen.” The committee being sent for by the convention, the gentlemen of the majority in committee then determined, that they would make no report of any amendments whatever, not even of those which they had almost unanimously agreed to, and the committee, under those circumstances, attended the house. Mr. Paca, as chairman, stated to the convention what had passed in the committee, read the amendments which had there been agreed to, and assigned the reason why no report had been formally made. A member then rose and proposed a vote of thanks to the president, which had been once read before the attendance of the committee, should have a second reading; and upon the second reading thereof, the previous question was called for by the members who wished to consider the amendments agreed to by the committee, and such other amendments as might be proposed. The house thereupon divided, and the yeas and nays were called for by the minority, the sense of the convention was taken thereon, and a majority determined that the yeas and nays should not be taken, nor would they permit the vote to be entered on the journal, by which the yeas and nays were prohibited: to preclude the consideration of any amendments, A motion was then made “that the convention adjourn without day,” on which the yeas and nays were taken and appeared as follow: Affirmative, The honourable the President, Messrs. Barnes, Chilton, Sewell, W. Tilghman, Yates, Granger, Chesley, Smith, Brown, Turner, Stone, Goldsborough, Stevens, G. Gale, Waggaman, Stewart, J. Gale, Sulivane, Shaw, Gilpin, Hollingsworth, Heron, Evans, O. Sprigg, Hall, Digges, Hanson, J. Tilghman, Hollyday, Hemsley, Morris, Lee, Potts, Faw, J. Richardson, Edmondson, McHenry, Coulter, T. Sprigg, Stull, Rawlings, Shryock, Cramphin, Thomas, Deakins, Edwards. 47 Negative. Messrs. Perkins, J. T. Chase, S. Chase, Mercer, Harrison, Wilkinson, Grahame, Parnham, Ridgely, Cockey, Cromwell, Lloyd, Hammond, Bowie, Carroll, Seney, Chaille, [James] Martin, Done, Johnson, Paca, Love, Pinkney, L. Martin, W. Richardson, and Driver. 27. We consider the proposed form of national government as very defective, and that the liberty and happiness of the people will be endangered if the system be not greatly changed and altered. The amendments agreed to by the committee, and those proposed by the minority, are now laid before you for your consideration, that you may express your sense as to such alterations as you may think proper to be made in the new constitution. We remain persuaded, that the importance of the alterations proposed, calculated to preserve public liberty, by those checks on power [669]which the experience of ages has rendered venerable, and to promote the happiness of the people by a due attention to their ease and convenience, will justify the steps we have taken to obtain them, to our constituents, and the world. Having no interest that can distinguish us from the rest of the community, we neither fear censure, nor wish applause. Having thus discharged the duty of citizens and trustees of the public, we shall now submit to the people those precautions and securities which, after mature reflection on this momentous subject, we deem necessary for their safety and happiness. May that all-wise and omnipotent Being, who made us masters of a fair and fruitful empire, inspire us with wisdom and fortitude to perpetuate to posterity that freedom which we received from our fathers!

Newspaper,No,A Republican,,Maryland Journal,Federalism,5/16/1788,"A Writer, under the signature of Federalism,2 has given the Citizens of Maryland some observations, in the last Journal, upon the adoption of the new constitution by this state, and upon the line of conduct which he thinks they ought to pursue hereafter, lest they should lose the blessing of that inestimable, and, in his opinion, all-perfect system of government. It is not difficult to discover, that the great object he has in view, is to prepare the way against the next general election, to prevent the re-election of the delegates for this town, and to introduce into the Assembly his favourite characters. Attempts of this nature have been successively made for several years, but have failed; I suppose the author flatters himself that the present is a more favourable occasion. That Federalism is highly “gratified by the act of the convention ratifying the new plan of government without amendments,” and that he has no wish amendments should ever take place, except of such a nature as to increase and enlarge the powers of the government, I can easily believe; but I have great doubts whether one or the other can be justly said of one man in ten of those who are “well informed,” and have no other object in view but the happiness and welfare of their country. This excellent plan he tells us was circulated extensively last fall, for the consideration of the people, who were not surprised into steps concerning it, but permitted coolly and maturely to examine it.—It is true, that on the first day of last December, the Assembly directed two thousand copies, a little more than a hundred for each county, of the proposed constitution to be printed, to be distributed for the information of the citizens;—of these, some in the course of the winter, were actually distributed through the counties.—But the number was much too small to go into the hands of the people generally; few of the common class of people had an opportunity of reading them at all, and much fewer of considering them with that attention necessary, to enable them to form an estimate of the benefits, or evils, which might probably flow from the government, if adopted. “But the News-Papers laid before the people impartially the arguments urged by various authors on either side.” The Annapolis Paper every body knows has a very confined circulation, and I believe not more than one or two original publications appeared in that Paper, and those in favour of the government; and it contained no republications on the subject.—The two Baltimore Papers do not circulate on the Eastern-Shore, and scarce a Paper of those Printers are seen there at any time; but the peculiar severity of the last winter precluded almost entirely all communication of sentiment or information.—Those Papers though they circulate through the different counties of the Western Shore, yet are read by, comparatively, few of the common class of the people.—Even in the city of Annapolis, so far are they from being generally seen, that it is difficult to obtain their perusal.—But had there been the freest communication of all the pieces written on both sides of the question, and had they been in the [738]hands of every individual, it would have been of but little consequence, if we may believe the members of the late convention, who so wisely adopted the system, since with them it was a favourite maxim, that the people at large were incompetent to decide or form a judgment on the subject; that they were, and always must be, in these things, directed by a few, who had more knowledge; and that the people at large were totally incapable of determining whether a government was perfect or imperfect, good or bad, until they felt its consequences, and gained the information by perceiving its effects. Federalism thinks it “almost surprising” to find the plain common sense of our citizens inclining them so generally to the right side of so important a question. But, perhaps, his surprise would, in some measure, cease were he to reflect that, in this state, there are about twenty-five thousand persons who were entitled to vote for the members of the convention; that the whole number who actually did vote, were but about six thousand, and that in Baltimore-Town, and seven counties, the voters were four thousand in number or thereabouts; so that the delegates of ten counties had not, on an average, two hundred votes; nor did one sixth part of the inhabitants of the state, who were entitled to vote, interfere in the election: Let him also consider, that the number of rich and wealthy men, who promise themselves peculiar advantages from this government, which they never could obtain in a government truly republican, and also the mercantile part of the community, who flatter themselves with deriving benefits from this system, at least with the means of speedily collecting their debts, exerted themselves in every county in favour of the constitution, using every argument to induce the people to consider it as the only means of relieving them from the distresses under which they suffer, and terrifying them with the prospect of anarchy and confusion if it was rejected.—To this I might add, that no opposition was made in scarce any of the counties, till a few days before the election, and that in those counties where the people had had the best means of information, the opposition succeeded. In some other counties, many of the inhabitants, disapproving the system, would not attend the election, because no candidates offered in opposition to it, and others returned home without voting, on the same principle. . . .

Letter,No,Samuel Chase,John Lamb,,,6/13/1788,"I returned from attending our General Court yesterday afternoon, and your letter, with one from The federal Republicans and several Inclosures,2 were delivered only a few Minutes ago.—I will have the publications reprinted. I was always averse from the Adoption of the proposed Constitution unless certain Amendments to declare & secure the Great and essential Rights of the people could be previously obtained, because I thought if they could not be procured before the Ratification they very probably could not be obtained afterwards, and the Conduct of the Advocates of the Government confirm my Opinion. I am convinced that the principal Characters who support the Government will [747]not agree to any Amendments. A Declaration of Rights alone will be of no essential Service. some of the powers must be abridged or public liberty will be endangered, and in time destroyed. I have no Hopes that any attempt will be made to obtain previous Alterations, and I fear any attempt after Ratification will be without Effect. I consider the Constitution as radically defective in this Essential the Bulk of the people can have Nothing to say to it—The Government is not a Government of the people, it is not a Government of Representation the people do not chuse the House of Representatives. a Right of Election is declared but it can not be exercised. it is a useless nugatory Right. by no Mode of Choice by the people at large or in Districts can they chuse Representatives. the Right is immediate and given to all the people, but it is impracticable to be exercised by them. I believe a very great Majority of the people of this State are in favour of Amendments, but they are depressed and inactive. they have lost all their former Spirit, and seem ready to submit to any Master. Governor Smallwood, Mr Mercer, Mr J T Chase, our attorney General3 and a few more are decided against the Government.—An attempt will be made to elect none but Federalists, as they falsly call themselves, to our next House of Delegates. a violent Opposition will be made to Me in this Town and is already begun on the avowed principle.—I am called on for this— I beg to be remembered to all the federal Republicans with You. I will instantly communicate to Governor Smallwood."

Newspaper,No,John Francis Mercer,,Maryland Gazette,,8/7/1788,"Being informed by colonel John [Francis] Mercer, that reports have been circulated in Maryland, that he (colonel Mercer) had written to his brother, James Mercer, Esq; informing him, that the people of Maryland were so averse to the new constitution of government recommended by the late federal convention, that they would take up arms against it; that this information had been communicated by some of the members, and particularly by me, to the Virginia convention; in consequence whereof some persons had come from the Virginia convention to Maryland, to make inquiry, and take depositions respecting it—I do hereby certify, that no such communication was made to the Virginia convention by me, nor by any other member, to my knowledge, [762page icon]nor any such measure as taking depositions in Maryland, mentioned, that I heard of, during my attendance in convention, which was very constant, from the beginning to the end of it.—That James Mercer, Esq; never communicated to me any letter from his brother colonel John Mercer, informing him, that the people of Maryland would take up arms against the said new government; nor do I believe that there is any foundation for the above mentioned reports, having never heard them in Richmond, or any where else, until this day, from colonel John Mercer himself. Given under my hand, in Stafford county, in Virginia, this 8th day of June, 1788. G. MASON. This is the certificate I refer to in my certificate of this date. JAMES MERCER. July 8, 1788.

JAMES MERCER.3 Annapolis, July 29, 1788.

I have never written to but four persons in the state of Virginia respecting this government since its publication, nor is it mentioned but in seven letters (to the best of my recollection) and in some of these but slightly, being complicated with my private business. I have taken pains to regain what I have written on this subject, and am in possession of all that has been received or preserved (as I believe) except one letter to governor Randolph, which I have written for. These letters I now retain, for the perusal of any [763page icon]gentleman; and for the truth of the facts they contain, and the substantiality of the opinions delivered in them, I hold myself answerable to the public and individuals.—This measure is truly disagreeable and painful, particularly as it exposes letters highly confidential and of a private nature, but I know of no other method of effectually exposing the slanders which have been propagated respecting them.

Newspaper,No,Samuel Chase,,Maryland Journal,Robert Smith,10/3/1788,"Mr. Goddard, A Correspondent has sent you what he says is the Speech delivered by Robert Smith, Esq; at the town-meeting; and I imagine [646]with his consent.—The language is greatly corrected and changed, additions made, and personal reflections on characters, as respectable as any in America, omitted. The declaration alleged to have fallen from me, “that every person, who should be instrumental in introducing the new government, would be guilty of high-treason,” &c. is misunderstood. The assertion that I made in the Convention was, in substance, that in an established government, if any body of men assembled to change such government, the act would be high-treason, if they failed; but a revolution if they succeeded: that the object of the meeting constituted the crime. I appeal to the Members of the Convention, and to Mr. Lloyd, who took down the debates,2 if I have not related the substance. I do not recollect I ever expressed this sentiment but in the Convention; and I am satisfied I never delivered myself in the manner stated by Mr. Smith. Ignorance has misunderstood, or malice misapplied my expressions.—Mr. Smith declared, that he heard me say (among other things) “that had I foreseen the consequences of the revolution, I would have been the greatest Tory in all North-America.” I most solemnly declare, that I do not believe, that I ever used such, or similar expressions, because they convey sentiments contrary to my principles, and the conduct of my whole life: There must be some mistake.—General reflections, or sarcastic observations by Mr. Smith, are unworthy of notice. SAMUEL CHASE. Baltimore-Town, October 1, 1788."
Broadside,No,Samuel Chase,,,,10/5/1788,"To the VOTERS of BALTIMORE-TOWN. GENTLEMEN, Having several times asserted, in the presence of many of you, that Doctor James McHenry opposed, in convention, any amendments to the new constitution for the United States, I will lay before you the conduct of Dr. McHenry in the convention, and in the committee of convention; from whence I formed this opinion. If I should be mistaken in any of the facts, you will not impute my mistake to any intention of misrepresenting Doctor McHenry’s conduct; and if I draw improper conclusions he will correct them. 1st. Fact. On Friday, the 25th of April, Doctor Coulter rose from his seat, and read to the convention a paper, by which he declared for himself and his colleague Doctor McHenry, “That they were elected and instructed by the people they represented to ratify the proposed [683]constitution, and that as speedily as possible, and to do no other act; that after the ratification their power ceased, and they did not consider themselves as authorised by their constituents to consider any amendments.” This fact was stated in a publication, signed by myself and eleven more, and was never contradicted in public.1 If Doctor McHenry considered himself speaking the sense of Baltimoretown in this declaration, it is evident that he could not, in his conventional capacity, consider, much less propose any amendments to the constitution, before or after the ratification of it by the convention. If you elected and instructed him only to ratify and to do no other act, it necessarily follows, that when he had discharged that trust his power, as your representative ceased, and from that moment he changed his public delegated character to that of a private citizen; and if afterwards he considered, or joined in proposing any amendments; it could only be as a private citizen, and not in his conventional capacity. I never heard of any instructions, of any kind, from this town to Doctor McHenry and Doctor Coulter. If in writing they can be produced; if lost, or verbally, their substance can be established.—It was universally believed, that all of you were for amendments after ratification. The committee who waited on Mr. McMechen and Mr. Sterett informed them, “that it was the sense of a numerous and respectable meeting of the citizens, that after the ratification of the constitution, amendments should be recommended, and every exertion made to obtain them, in the constitutional manner prescribed by the federal government”—Mr. McMechen and Mr. Sterett were candidates to the convention, and this declaration was certainly made to express the opinion of the meeting what was expected from them if elected. It could have no possible relation to their private conduct. 2d. Fact. That a committee of the convention agreed to 13 amendments;(a) Doctor McHenry voting (I believe) for the whole. The committee differed only as to three other amendments.(b) Doctor Mchenry (with others of the committee) insisted as an express condition, that none of the propositions rejected, or any others should be laid before the convention for their consideration, except only those the committee had agreed to; and Dr. McHenry also voted, in the committee, not to report to the convention any amendments whatever, not even those they had agreed to. This fact also was stated in a publication signed by myself, and eleven more, and was never contradicted in public. By this unprecedented conduct Doctor McHenry, with the majority of the committee, precluded, as far as they could, the convention from considering any amendments to the constitution. 3d Fact. Doctor McHenry in the convention voted “that the convention adjourn without day.” This vote was published.2 Doctor McHenry by this vote, with the majority, prevented the convention from even considering any amendments. I shall not trespass upon your time with any further remarks. I am, gentlemen, With great respect and esteem, Your obedient servant, SAMUEL CHASE. (a) Of the thirteen amendments twelve were proposed by the minority of the committee (b) 1. That the militia, unless selected by lot or voluntarily enlisted, shall not be marched beyond the limits of an adjoining state, without the consent of their legislature or executive 2. That congress shall have no power to alter or change the time, place or manner, of holding elections for senators or representatives, unless a state shall neglect to make regulations, or to execute its regulations, or shall be prevented by invasion or rebellion; in which cases only congress may interfere, until the cause be removed. 3. That, in every law of congress imposing direct taxes, the collection thereof shall be suspended for a certain reasonable time therein limited, and on payment of the sum by any state, by the time appointed, such taxes shall not be collected."
